</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package for Linux Fast-STREAMS is an implementation of the X/Open
Transport Interface or SVID Transport Layer Interface library in accordance with SUSv2 and XNS 5.2
standards.  It consists of user-space libraries (libxnet) and a set of cooperating STREAMS modules
(<a href="man/man2html?4+timod"><b>timod</b>(4)</a> and <a href="man/man2html?4+tirdwr"><b>tirdwr</b>(4)</a>).
The STREAMS module, <a href="man2html?timod(4)"><b>timod</b>(4)</a>, is pushed on any Stream
implementing the Transport Provider Interface (TPI) Revision 1.5 or 2.0.0 service interface and
provides XTI/TLI library access to the transport provider.  Definitions for the Transport Provider
Interface (TPI) Revision 2.0.0 are also provided by header files included in the package.
