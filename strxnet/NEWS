* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-3

  Added check for CONFIG_REGPARM, addition of -mregparm=3 CFLAGS, addition
  of regparm_ prefix for exported ksyms.

  Minor corretions to separate build directory install of devices and caching
  of detected ksyms.

  Added option for suppression of exported symbol versioning.

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-2

  A couple of corrections to the build process reported by Gurol.  Changed
  order of build in `make rebuild' target to build tools last so that the rpm
  debug package is built correctly on RH9.
  
  Change MODULE_PARM to static so that make install-strip does not strip
  module parameter symbols.

* Initial release strxnet-0.9.2-1
