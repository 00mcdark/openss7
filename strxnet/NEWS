* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2.7

  This release has been verified (conformance test suite passes) for operation
  with Linux Fast-STREAMS (streams-0.7a.4).  Some test cases were updated
  because LiS was not operating correctly on pipes (does not send SIGPIPE on
  write error contrary to POSIX).

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2.6

  With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream version
  only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All RPM release
  numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian release numbers will be
  _0.  If you wish to apply patches and relelease the package, please bump up
  the release number and apply a suitable release suffix for your organization.
  We leave Debian release number _1 reserved for your use, so you can still
  bundle the source in the .dsc file.

  Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels and
  popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider distribution
  support.  The package also supports both LiS 2.18.1 as well as streams-0.7a
  on both kernels.

  Removed XNS kernel modules, header files and documentation to a separate
  strxns-0.9.2-1 package and INET kernel modules, header files and documentation
  to a separate strinet-0.9.2-1 package.

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-5

  Minor corrections: made SCTP manpages conditional on OpenSS7 SCTP kernel.

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-4

  Changes to ompile, install and builds rpms for Fedora Core 1 (FC1), Whitebox
  Enterprise Linux (WBEL) and RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 (EL3).  Included
  explicit epoch in internal dependencies in spec file for RPM versions 4.2.1,
  4.2.2 and higher.  Added hugemem kernel detection and moved getpmsg and
  putpmsg manual pages.

  Correction to symbolic linking and system map file location during non-rpm
  autoconf installation.

  Correction to zero maxlen behavior in t_rcvconnect().

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-3

  Added check for CONFIG_REGPARM, addition of -mregparm=3 CFLAGS, addition
  of regparm_ prefix for exported ksyms.

  Minor corretions to separate build directory install of devices and caching
  of detected ksyms.

  Added option for suppression of exported symbol versioning.

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-2

  A couple of corrections to the build process reported by Gurol.  Changed
  order of build in `make rebuild' target to build tools last so that the rpm
  debug package is built correctly on RH9.
  
  Change MODULE_PARM to static so that make install-strip does not strip
  module parameter symbols.

* Initial release strxnet-0.9.2-1

  Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the OpenSS7 strxnet release.
