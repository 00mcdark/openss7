OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.10 of the STREAMS X/Open Transport Interface (XTI/TLI) <em>strxnet</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package for Linux Fast-STREAMS is an implementation of the X/Open
Trasnport Interface or SVID Transport Layer Interface library in accordance with SUSv2 and XNS 5.2
standards.  It consists of user-space libraries (libxnet) and a set of cooperating STREAMS modules
(<a href="man/man2html?4+timod">timod(4)</a> and <a href="man/man2html?4+tirdwr">tirdwr(4)</a>).
The STREAMS module, timod(4), is pushed on any Stream implementing the Transport Provider Interface
(TPI) Revision 1.5 or 2.0.0 service interface and provides XTI/TLI library access to the transport
provider.  Definitions for the Transport Provider Interface (TPI) Revision 2.0.0 are also provided
by header files included in the package.
