 OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking
===========================

Package strxnet-0.9.2.12 was released under GPLv2 2007-08-12.

The `OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking' package for `Linux Fast-STREAMS' is an
implementation of the X/Open Transport Interface or SVID Transport
Layer Interface library in accordance with SUSv2 and XNS 5.2 standards.
It consists of user-space libraries (`libxnet') and a set of
cooperating "STREAMS" modules (`timod(4)' and `tirdwr(4)').  The
"STREAMS" module, `timod(4)', is pushed on any Stream implementing the
Transport Provider Interface (TPI) Revision 1.5 or 2.0.0 service
interface and provides XTI/TLI library access to the transport
provider.  Definitions for the Transport Provider Interface (TPI)
Revision 2.0.0 are also provided by header files included in the
package.

The package contains the following standard `Open Systems Interconnect
(OSI)' conforming header files:

     - `<sys/tiusr.h>'         `TPI Version 2.0.0' user
     - `<sys/tihdr.h>'         `TPI Version 2.0.0' kernel
     - `<sys/ticots.h>'        `TPI COTS'
     - `<sys/ticots_ord.h>'    `TPI COTS w/ Orderly Release'
     - `<sys/ticlts.h>'        `TPI CLTS'
     - `<xti.h>'               `XTI/TLI Library'
     - `<xti_inet.h>'          `XTI/TLI Library'

Note that the `Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)' and `Network
Provider Interface' are contained in the `strxns-0.9.2.7' package.

The package builds and installs the following "STREAMS" kernel modules
and drivers:

     - `streams_timod.ko' module "timod"
     - `streams_tirdwr.ko' module "tirdwr"

`timod(4)'
     a "STREAMS" XTI/TLI compatibility interface.

`tirdwr(4)'
     a "STREAMS" XTI/TLI read write compatibility module.

The package builds and installs the following shared object and static
libraries:

`libxnet(3)'
     `XNS 5.2' XTI/TLI Library (`libxnet')


The `OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking' package includes kernel modules, `SVR
4.2' "STREAMS" drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs,
daemons, and development environment for the development and execution
of `OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking' protocol stack components and
applications for the `SVR 4.2' "STREAMS" environment.

This distribution is only currently applicable to `Linux' 2.4 and 2.6
kernels and was targeted at `ix86', `x86_64', `ppc' and `ppc64'
architectures, but should build and install for other architectures as
well.

interested in different licensing terms, please contact the copyright
holder, or OpenSS7 Corporation <sales@openss7.com>.

See `README-alpha' (if it exists) for alpha release information.

 Prerequisites
--------------

The quickest and easiest way to ensure that all prerequisites are met
is to download and install this package from within the `OpenSS7 Master
Package', `openss7-0.9.2.G', instead of separately.

Prerequisites for the OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package are as follows:

  1. `Linux' distribution, somewhat `Linux Standards Base' compliant,
     with a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel and the appropriate tool chain for
     compiling out-of-tree kernel modules.  Most recent `Linux'
     distributions are usable out of the box, but some development
     packages must be installed.  For more information, see
     `Compatibility', in the manual.

         - A fairly LSB compliant GNU/Linux distribution.(1)
         - Linux 2.4 kernel (2.4.10 - 2.4.27), or
         - Linux 2.6 kernel (2.6.3 - 2.6.21);
         - glibc2 or better.
         - GNU info (for info files).
         - GNU groff (for man pages).(2)

(Note: If you acquired `strxnet' a part of the `OpenSS7 Master
Package', then the dependencies listed below will already have been met
by unpacking the master package.)

  2. `OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS', streams-0.9.2.4
     (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/streams-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2).  (3)

  3. `OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility Modules',
     strcompat-0.9.2.7
     (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strcompat-0.9.2.7.tar.bz2).

  4. `OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS', strxns-0.9.2.7
     (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strxns-0.9.2.7.tar.bz2).


When configuring and building multiple `OpenSS7 Project' release
packages, place all of the source packages (unpacked tarballs) at the
same directory level and all build directories at the same directory
level (e.g. all source packages under `/usr/src').

When installing packages that install as kernel modules, it is
necessary to have the correct kernel development package installed.
For the following distributions, use the following commands:

     Ubuntu:  $> apt-get install linux-headers
     Debian:  $> apt-get install kernel-headers
     Fedora:  $> yum install kernel-devel

You also need the same version of `gcc(1)' compiler with which the
kernel was built.  If it is not the default, add `CC=kgcc' on the line
after `./configure', for example:

     $> ../strxnet-0.9.2.12/configure CC='gcc-3.4'

 Installation
-------------

The following commands will download, configure, build, check, install,
validate, uninstall and remove the package:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strxnet-0.9.2.12.tar.bz2
     $> tar -xjvf strxnet-0.9.2.12.tar.bz2
     $> mkdir build
     $> pushd build
     $> ../strxnet-0.9.2.12/configure --enable-autotest
     $> make
     $> make check
     $> sudo make install
     $> sudo make installcheck
     $> sudo make uninstall
     $> popd
     $> sudo rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf strxnet-0.9.2.12
     $> rm -f strxnet-0.9.2.12.tar.bz2

If you have problems, try building with the logging targets instead.
If the make of a logging target fails, an automatic problem report will
be generated that can be mailed to The OpenSS7 Project
<bugs@openss7.org>.(4) Installation steps using the logging targets
proceed as follows:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strxnet-0.9.2.12.tar.bz2
     $> tar -xjvf strxnet-0.9.2.12.tar.bz2
     $> mkdir build
     $> pushd build
     $> ../strxnet-0.9.2.12/configure --enable-autotest
     $> make compile.log
     $> make check.log
     $> sudo make install.log
     $> sudo make installcheck.log
     $> sudo make uninstall.log
     $> popd
     $> sudo rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf strxnet-0.9.2.12
     $> rm -f strxnet-0.9.2.12.tar.bz2

See `README-make' for additional specialized make targets.

For custom applications, see the `INSTALL' and `INSTALL-strxnet' files
or the see `Installation', in the manual, as listed below.  If you
encounter troubles, see `Troubleshooting', in the manual, before
issuing a bug report.

 Brief Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

The OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package is available from the downloads
area of The OpenSS7 Project website
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) using a command such as:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strxnet-0.9.2.12.tar.bz2

Unpack the tarball using a command such as:

     $> tar -xjvf strxnet-0.9.2.12.tar.bz2

The tarball will unpack into the relative subdirectory named after the
package name: strxnet-0.9.2.12.

The package builds using the GNU `autoconf' utilities and the
`configure' script.  To build the package, we recommend using a
separate `build' directory as follows:

     $> mkdir build
     $> cd build
     $> ../strxnet-0.9.2.12/configure

In general, the package configures and builds without adding any
special options to the `configure' script.  For general options to the
`configure' script, see the GNU `INSTALL' file in the distribution:

     $> less ../strxnet-0.9.2.12/INSTALL

For specific options to the `configure' script, see the
`INSTALL-strxnet' file in the distribution, or simply execute the
configure script with the `--help' option like so:

     $> ../strxnet-0.9.2.12/configure --help

After configuring the package, the package can be compiled simply by
issuing the `make' command:

     $> make

Some specialized makefile targets exists, see the `README-make' file in
the distribution or simply invoke the `help' target like so:

     $> make help | less

After successfully building the package, the package can be checked by
invoking the `check' make target like so:

     $> make check

After successfully checking the package, the package can be installed
by invoking the `install' make target (as root) like so:

     $> sudo make install

The test suites that ship with the package can be invoked after the
package has been installed by invoking the `installcheck' target.  This
target can either be invoked as root, or as a normal user, like so:

     $> make installcheck

(Note: you must add the `--enable-autotest' flag to `configure', above
for the test suites to be invoked with `make installcheck'.)

The package can be cleanly removed by invoking the `uninstall' target
(as root):

     $> sudo make uninstall

Then the build directory and tarball can be simply removed:

     $> cd ..
     $> rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf strxnet-0.9.2.12
     $> rm -f strxnet-0.9.2.12.tar.bz2

 Detailed Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the
`Installation', in the manual, contained in the distribution in `text',
`info', `html' and `pdf' formats:

     $> cd ../strxnet-0.9.2.12
     $> less doc/manual/strxnet.txt
     $> lynx doc/manual/strxnet.html
     $> info doc/manual/strxnet.info
     $> xpdf doc/manual/strxnet.pdf

The `text' version of the manual is always available in the `MANUAL'
file in the release.

The current manual is also always available online from `The OpenSS7
Project' website at:

     $> lynx http://www.openss7.org/strxnet_manual.html

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) See `GNU/Linux Distributions', in the manual, for more information.

(2) If you are using a Debian release, please make sure to install the
groff extension package (`groff_ext'), as it contains the `refer' or
`grefer' commands necessary for including references in the manual
