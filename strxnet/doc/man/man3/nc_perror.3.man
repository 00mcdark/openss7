.SH NAME
.B nc_perror
\- print a network selection error message
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B #include <netconfig.h>
.HP 12
.BI "void nc_perror(const char *" msg );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP \w'handle\(em'u
.I msg
A short message string to prefix (with a colon appended) to the error message printed to standard
error by the
.BR nc_perror ()
subroutine.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.IR UNIX \(rg
has traditionally provided three components of the Network Services Library,
.BR libnsl (3),
that are associated with Transport Provider Interface,
.BR tpi (7),
.IR STREAMS (9)
network pseudo-device drivers, and that are not currently part of the
.B Linux
Network Services Library.  These components are:
.IP 1. \w'1.\(em'u
Network Configuration database access, see
.BR netconfig (3).
.PD 0
.IP 2.
Network Directory and address mapping, see
.BR netdir (3).
.IP 3.
Network Path access, see
.BR netpath (3).
.PD
.PP
These are often refered to as the Network Selection facility of the Network
Services Library.
.PP
.BR nc_perror ()
prints the error message associated with the failure of the last called
.BR netconfig (3)
function.
If the
.I msg
argument is
.RB non- NULL ,
the message string prefixed to the error message followed by a colon and a space in the same manner
as
.BR perror (3).
When
.I msg
is
.BR NULL ,
no message, colon nor space is prefixed.
Following the optional colon and space, the error string returned by
.BR nc_sperror (3)
is printed followed by a new-line character.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR nc_perror ()
and
.BR nc_sperror (3)
must be called immediately after the failed network configuration subroutine
fails.  Otherwise, the error condition may be lost.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
.BR nc_perror ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR nc_perror ()
always succeeds.
.PP
One of the following error messages will be printed:
.TP
.RB [ NC_NOERROR ]
.RI \(lq "no error" \(rq
.br
The last
.BR netconfig (3)
operation was successful.
.TP
.RB [ NC_NOMEM ]
.RI \(lq "out of memory" \(rq
.br
Memory could not be allocated to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ NC_NOSET ]
.RI \(lq "routine called before calling setnetpath() or setnetconfig()" \(rq
.br
.BR getnetconfig (3)
or
.BR getnetpath (3)
was called without first calling
.BR setnetconfig (3)
or
.BR setnetpath (3).
.TP
.RB [ NC_OPENFAIL ]
.RI \(lq "cannot open /etc/netconfig" \(rq
.br
The
.B /etc/netconfig
file could not be opened for reading.
.TP
.RB [ NC_BADLINE ]
.RI \(lq "error in /etc/netconfig: field %d of line %d" \(rq
.br
A syntax error exists in the
.B /etc/netconfig
file at the location shown.
.TP
.RB [ NC_NOTFOUND ]
.RI \(lq "netid not found in /etc/netconfig" \(rq
.br

.I netid
specified to
.BR getnetconfigent (3)
was not found in the
.B /etc/netconfig
file.
.TP
.RB [ NC_NOMOREENTRIES ]
.RI \(lq "no more entries in /etc/netconfig" \(rq
.br
.BR getnetconfig (3)
was called an nore more entries exist in the
.B /etc/netconfig
file.
.TP
.RB [ ??? ]
.RI \(lq "unknown error" \(rq
.br
An internal error occured in the
.BR libxnsl (3)
library.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR nc_perror ()
is compatible with
.I "SVR 4.2"
.[
svr42
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
including
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixdoc
.]
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.[
hpuxdoc
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7doc
.]
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7doc
.]
describe the
.BR nc_sperror ()
subroutine as returning a pointer to thread-specific data and that the buffer
could change at any point.  While the error value is saved as thread-specific
data, this implementation of
.BR nc_sperror ()
returns a pointer to a shared read-only string that is valid for the duration
of the calling process.
.IP \(em
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
stores the error condition in
.IR _nderror (3).
.IP \(em
Diagnostic message strings are not documented and are incompatible.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility would only be coincidental.
.IP \(em
On
.IR UNIX \(rg
systems, these utility subroutines are normally part of the Network Services
Library,
.BR libnsl (3);
however,
.B Linux
already has a library of that name (which unfortunately is missing these
components), and, therefore,
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
renames the library to
.BR libxnsl.so .
.PP
See
.BR libnsl (3)
for additional compatibility information.

.SH CONFORMANCE

.SH HISTORY
.PP
The network configuration subroutines first appeared in

These subroutines are related to the

.BR STREAMS (9)
implementation of network transport providers.
