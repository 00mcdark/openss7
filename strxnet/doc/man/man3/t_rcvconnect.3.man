.HP 8
.BI "int t_rcvconnect(int " fd ", struct t_call *" call );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint upon which to receive the connection confirmation.
.TP
.I call
a pointer to a
.B t_call
structure to contain returned information about the connected peer.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which to receive the connection
confirmation.
.PP
.I call
is a pointer to a
.B t_call
structure that returns information about the responding transport endpoint
including the remote address, options and connection data.
The
.B t_call
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_call {
        struct netbuf addr;             /* address */
        struct netbuf opt;              /* options */
        struct netbuf udata;            /* user data */
        int sequence;                   /* sequence number */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_call
structure returns the following members and information:
.TP
.I addr
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the responding transport address.
The
.I call->addr.maxlen
field is significant on call and the
.I call->addr.len
field is significant on return.
When
.I call->addr.maxlen
is zero, no responding address will be returned.
When
.I call->addr.len
returns zero, not responding address was available.
.TP
.I opt
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the responding transport options.
The
.I call->opt.maxlen
field is significant on call and the
.I call->opt.len
field is significant on return.
When
.I call->opt.maxlen
is zero, no responding options will be returned.
When
.I call->opt.len
returns zero, not responding options were available.
.TP
.I udata
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the responding connection data.
The
.I call->udata.maxlen
field is significant on call and the
.I call->udata.len
field is significant on return.
When
.I call->udata.maxlen
is zero, no responding connection data will be returned.
When
.I call->udata.len
returns zero, not responding connection data was available.
.TP
.I sequence
is not used by
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
and is left unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
is only valid in state
.BR T_OUTCON .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
will block until a connection confirmation or asynchronous event occurs on
.IR fd .
In asynchronous mode,
if a connection confirmation is not immediately available,
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
will fail, return -1 and set
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.BR TNODATA .
.PP
A call to
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
is not normally necessary in synchronous mode.
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_connect (3)
normally blocks until a connection confirmation is received.
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
is typically used in asynchronous mode, where
.BR t_connect (3)
returns immediately after call and
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
is needed to receive the connection confirmation.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_rcvconnect ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The \fImaxlen\fR field of a \fBnetbuf\fR(3) structure,
.IR "" ( addr ", " opt ", " udata ),
passed to the call was
non-zero, but insufficient to hold the available information.  See,
\fBnetbuf\fR(3) for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See \fBt_look\fR(3) for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNODATA ]
An attempt was made to read data but no data indication was available and
.I fd
was set for asynchronous mode operation with
.BR O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
in a call to
.BR t_open "(3) or " fcntl (2).
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
This can occur when the underlying transport provider is of the connectionless service type
.RB [R T_CLTS . ]
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.RB [R T_OUTCON . ]
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fR system error occured and the \fBLinux\fR error number is set in \fIerrno\fR(3).
