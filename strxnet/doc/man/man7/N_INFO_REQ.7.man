.SH NAME
.BR N_INFO_REQ " (" N_info_req_t )
\- network information request
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive requests the NS provider to return the values of all supported
protocol parameters (see under
.BR N_INFO_ACK (7)),
and also the current state of the NS provider (as defined in Appendix B).  This
primitive does not affect the state of the network provider and does not appear
in the state tables.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of the message is one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block and its structure is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;            /* always N_INFO_REQ */
} N_info_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in any state where a local acknowledgment is not
pending.
.SH "NEW STATE"
The new state remains unchanged.
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires the NS provider to generate one of the
following acknowledgments upon receipt of the primitive:
.IP \- 4
.B Successful:
Acknowledgment of the primitive via the N_INFO_ACK primitive.
.IP \-
.B Non-fatal_errors:
There are no errors associated with the issuance of this primitive.
