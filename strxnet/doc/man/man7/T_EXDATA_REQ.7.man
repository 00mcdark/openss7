.TH T_EXDATA_REQ 7 "$Date: 2004/04/04 00:12:52 $" "$Name:  $" "Transport Provider Interface (TPI)"
.SH NAME
.B T_EXDATA_REQ
\- Expedited Data Request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This  message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks containing at least one byte of data.  The format of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct T_exdata_req {
    t_scalar_t   PRIM_type;      /* Always T_EXDATA_REQ */
    t_scalar_t   MORE_flag;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This  primitive  indicates  to  the  transport  provider  that this message
contains an expedited transport interface data unit.  One or more  expedited
transport  interface  data units form an expedited transport service data
unit.
.PP
Note  that  the  maximum size of a expedited transport service data unit  is
indicated  to  the  transport  user  via  the
.BR T_INFO_ACK (7)
primitive.
.PP
This  primitive  has  a mechanism which indicates the beginning and end  of
an expedited transport service data unit.  However, not all transport
providers  support the concept of an expedited transport service data unit.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
.TP
.I MORE_flag
when  greater  than  zero  indicates that the next
.B T_EXDATA_REQ
primitive is
also part of this expedited transport service data unit.
.SH RULES
This  primitive  does  not require any acknowledgments, although it may
generate a fatal error.  This is indicated via a
.B M_ERROR
message type  which
results in the failure of all operating system service routines on the stream.
.SH ERRORS
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.BR [EPROTO]
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
.RS
.IP - 3
The transport service interface was found to be in an incorrect state.  If the
interface is in the TS_IDLE state when the provider receives the
.B T_EXDATA_REQ
primitive, then the transport provider should just drop the message without
generating a fatal error.
.IP -
The amount of transport user data associated with the primitive defines an
expedited transport service data unit larger than that allowed by the
transport provider.
.SH MODES
Only connection-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport user.
