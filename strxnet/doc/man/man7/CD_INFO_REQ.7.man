.SH NAME
.B CD_INFO_REQ
\- information request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
or
.B M_PCPROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
} cd_info_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This user originated primitive requests that the provider acknowledge the
primitive with a
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7)
primitive indicating protocol and option information.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Specifies the primitives type.
.SS State
This primitive is valid in any state other than
.B CD_UNUSABLE
where a local acknowledgement is not pending.
The state is unchanged as a result of the primitive.
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires the provider to acknowledge reciept of the primitive
as follows:
.PP
.B "Successful:"
When successful, the provider acknowledges the primitive with the
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7).
.PP
.B "Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):"
When unsuccessful, the provider acknowledges the primitive with the
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
indicating the reason for failure of the primitive.
