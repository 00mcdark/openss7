This is the OpenSS7 Release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, drivers and
modules used with the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} or @cite{Linux STREAMS} SVR
4.2 STREAMS utility for Linux.  The purpose of providing a separate release of
this package was to separate the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, headers, drivers
and modules from the @cite{Linux STREAMS} package for use with both @cite{Linux
STREAMS} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} in preparation for replacement of the
former by the later.

The following sections provide information on @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} releases as
well as compatibility information of OpenSS7 release to the original GCOM
releases of these modules and drivers, as well as Linux kernel compatibility.

@subsection @value{PVER}-@value{PACKAGE_RELEASE}
@cindex @value{PVER}-@value{PACKAGE_RELEASE}

Dropped RPM epoch to 0 from 1 in preparation for RPM release.
Bumped RPM release to 5.

Minor corrections: made SCTP manpages conditional on OpenSS7 SCTP kernel.

Updated documentation and provided improvements to build process applied to
other packages.  This includes improvements to creation of info and pdf manuals.
Update @command{tirdwr} and @command{timod} manpage.

Removed INET package from @file{@value{PVER}} release.  This has now been moved
to the @file{strxns-0.9.2}@footnote{@xref{Top, About This Manual, About This
Manual, strxns, OpenSS7 XNS Networking Installation and Reference Manual}}
package.  Removed XNS header files and manual pages for CDI, DLPI and NPI to
that package.  Also removed @command{test-inet_raw}, @command{test-inet_udp} and
@command{test-inet_tcp} test programs to that package.  Removed @file{/dev/inet}
driver to that package.  Stripped out the -dev- RPM subpackage as there are no
devices left in the package.  Adjusted the virtual package provides naming to a
more rational approach.  Adjusted kernel module installation process to
accomodate.

Genksyms now generates kernels symbols for all combinations of SMP and
@var{CONFIG_REGPARM} kernels allowing a single modversions header file.
Improved manpages @command{automake} file fragment (@file{am/man.am}) to
accomodate top-level manual pages (this was really for the @file{netperf}
release).

@node @value{PVER}-4, @value{PVER}-3 , @value{PVER}-@value{PACKAGE_RELEASE}, Release Notes
@subsection @value{PVER}-4
@cindex @value{PVER}-4

Changes to compile, install.  Now builds rpms for @cite{Fedora Core 1 (FC1)},
@cite{Whitebox Enterprise Linux (WBEL)} and @cite{RedHat Enterprise Linux
(EL3)}.

Included explicit epoch in internal dependencies in @file{.spec} file for RPM
versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and higher.  Added hugemem kernel detection and moved
@command{getpmsg} and @command{putpmsg} manual pages.

Correction to symbolic linking and system map file location during non-rpm
@command{autoconf} installation.

Correction to zero maxlen behavior in @command{t_rcvconnect()}.

@node @value{PVER}-3, @value{PVER}-2 , @value{PVER}-4, Release Notes
@subsection @value{PVER}-3
@cindex @value{PVER}-3

Added check for @var{CONFIG_REGPARM}, addition of @command{-mregparm=3}
@var{CFLAGS}, addition of @samp{regparm_} prefix for exported kernel symbols.

Minor corrections to separate build directory install of devices and caching of
detected kernel symbols.

Added an option for suppression of exported symbol versioning
(@command{--without-modversions}).

@node @value{PVER}-2, @value{PVER}-1 , @value{PVER}-3, Release Notes
@subsection @value{PVER}-2
@cindex @value{PVER}-2

A couple of corrections to the build process reported by Gurol.  Changed order
of build in @samp{make rebuild} target to build tools last so that the rpm debug
package is build correctly on @cite{RedHat 9}.

Changed @var{MODULE_PARM} to static so that @samp{make install-strip} does not
strip module parameter symbols.

@node @value{PVER}-1, , @value{PVER}-2, Release Notes
@subsection @value{PVER}-1
@cindex @value{PVER}-1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the OpenSS7 @command{@value{PVER}} release.
