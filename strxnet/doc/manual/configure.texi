@c This file is include from install.texi and contains the descriptions for
@c package-specific enable/disable and with/without options

In addition, the following @command{configure} options, specific to the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package are available:

@ignore
@table @command
@item --enable-sctp-slow-verification
@opindex sctp-slow-verification
Enable slow verification of addresses and tags.

When a message comes from an SCTP enpoint with the correct verification tag, it is not necessary to check whether it is
from a correct source address to identify the SCTP association to which it belongs.  When you disable this feature
(@command{--disable-sctp-slow-verification}), source addresses are not checked and it is up to firewall implementations
to thwart attackers of the verification tag.  When you enable this feature (@command{--enablesctp-slow-verification}),
you get RFC 2960 compliant operation, but at great cost to SCTP performance.

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --enable-sctp-throttle-heartbeats
@opindex sctp-throttle-heartbeats
Enable heartbeat throttling.

Special feature of @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} that is not mentioned in RFC 2960.  When you enable this feature
(@command{--enable-sctp-throttle-heartbeats}), @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} will throttle the rate at which it responds to
heartbeats to the system control @var{heartbeat_interval}.  This makes SCTP more resilient to implementations which
flood heartbeat messages.  For RFC 2960 compliant operation, disable this feature (@command{--disable-sctp-throttle-heartbeats}).

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --enable-sctp-discard-ootb
@opindex sctp-discard-ootb
Enable discard of out-of-the-blue packets.

RFC 2960 requires the implementation to send @code{ABORT} to some OOTB packets (packets for which no SCTP association
exists).  Sending @code{ABORT} chunks to unverified source addresses with the T bit set opens SCTP to blind masquerade
attacks.  Not sending them may lead to delays at the peer endpoint aborting associations where our @code{ABORT} has been
lost and the socket is already closed or if we have restarted and the peer still has open associations to us.  If you
enable this feature (@command{--enable-sctp-discard-ootb}), SCTP will discard all OOTB packets.  This is necessary if
another SCTP stack is being run on the same machine.  Therefore, if the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package is included on an
OpenSS7 SCTP kernel, this feature is automagically enabled.  For RFC 2960 compliant operation, disable this feature
(@command{--disable-sctp-discard-ootb}).

This option defaults to disabled for non-OpenSS7 SCTP kernels, and enable for OpenSS7 SCTP kernels.

@item --enable-sctp-extended-ip-support
@opindex sctp-extended-ip-support
Enable extended IP support for SCTP.

This provides extended IP support for SCTP for things like IP Transparent Proxy and IP Masquerading.  This is
experimental stuff.  If in doubt, disable this feature (@command{--disable-sctp-expended-ip-support}).

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --disable-sctp-hmac-sha1
@opindex sctp-hmac-sha1
Disable SHA-1 HMAC.

This provides the ability to use the FIPS 180-1 (SHA-1) message authentication code in SCTP cookies.  If you enable this
feature (@command{--enable-sctp-hmac-sha1}), when the appropriate sysctl is set, SCTP will use the SHA-1 HMAC when signing
cookies in the @code{INIT-ACK} chunk.  If disable this feature (@command{--disable-sctp-hmac-sha1}), the SHA-1 HMAC will
be unavailable for use with SCTP.

This option defaults to enabled.

@item --disable-sctp-hmac-md5
@opindex sctp-hmac-md5
Disable MD5 HMAC.

This provides the ability to use the MD5 (RFC 1321) message authentication code in SCTP cookies.  If you enable this
feature (@command{--enable-sctp-hmac-md5}), when the appropriate sysctl is set, SCTP will use the MD5 HMAC when signing
cookies in the INIT ACK chunk.  If you disable this feature (@command{--disable-sctp-hmac-md5}), the MD5 HMAC will be
unavailable for use with SCTP.

This option defaults to enabled.

@item --enable-sctp-adler32
@opindex sctp-adler32
Enable Adler32 checksum.

This provides the ability to use the older RFC 2960 Adler32 checksum.  If CONFIG_SCTP_CRC_32 below is not selected, the
Adler32 checksum is always provided.

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --disable-sctp-crc32c
@opindex sctp-crc32c
Disable CRC-32C checksum.

This provides the ability to use the newer CRC-32c checksum as described in RFC 3309.  When this is selected and
CONFIG_SCTP_ADLER_32 is not selected above, then the only checksum that will be used is the CRC-32c checksum.

This option defaults to enabled.

@item --enable-sctp-throttle-passiveopens
@opindex sctp-throttle-passiveopens
Enable throttling of passive opens.

Special feature of Linux SCTP not mentioned in RFC 2960.  When secure algorithms are used for signing cookies, the
implementation becomes vulnerable to INIT and @code{COOKIE-ECHO} flooding.  If you enable this feature
(@command{--enable-sctp-throttle-passiveopens}), SCTP will only allow one INIT and one @code{COOKIE-ECHO} to be
processed in each interval corresponding to the sysctl sctp_throttle_itvl.  Setting sctp_throttle_itvl to 0 defeats this
function.  If you disable this feature (@command{--disable-sctp-throttle-passiveopens}), each INIT and
@code{COOKIE-ECHO} will be processed.

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --enable-sctp-ecn
@opindex sctp-ecn
Enable explicit congestion notification.

This enables support for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) chunks in SCTP messages as defined in RFC 2960 and RFC
3168.  It also adds syctl (/proc/net/ipv4/sctp_ecn) which allows ECN for SCTP to be disabled at runtime.

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --enable-sctp-lifetimes
@opindex sctp-lifetimes
Enable SCTP message lifetimes.

This enables support for message lifetimes as described in RFC 2960.  When enabled, message lifetimes can be set on
messages.  See sctp(7).  This feature is always enabled when Partial Reliability Support is set.

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --enable-sctp-add-ip
@opindex sctp-add-ip
Enable ADD-IP.

This enables support for ADD-IP as described in draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp-07.txt.  This allows the addition and
removal of IP addresses from existing connections.  This is experimental stuff.

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --enable-sctp-adaptation-layer-info
@opindex sctp-adaptation-layer-info
Enable ALI.

This enables support for the Adaptation Layer Information parameter described in draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp-07.txt for
communicating application layer information bits at initialization.  This is experimental stuff.

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --enable-sctp-partial-reliability
@opindex sctp-partial-reliability
Enable SCTP Partial Reliability (PR-SCTP).

This enables support for PR-SCTP as described in draft-stewart-tsvwg-prsctp-03.txt.  This allows for partial reliability
of message delivery on a "timed reliability" basis.  This is experimental stuff.

This option defaults to disabled.

@item --disable-sctp-error-generator
@opindex sctp-error-generator
Disable the SCTP error generator.

This provides an internal error generator that can be accessed with socket options for testing SCTP operation under
packet loss.  You will need this option to run some of the test programs distributed with the SCTP module.

This option defaults to enabled.

@item --with-sctp
@opindex sctp
Enable the version 1 driver in the build.
This option defaults to disabled.

@item --with-sctp2
@opindex sctp2
Enable the version 2 driver in the build.
This option defaults to enabled.
