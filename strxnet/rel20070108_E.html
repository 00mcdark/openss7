This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate release of the OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking that were
formerly part of the strinet package.  These networking modules provide TPI and XTI/TLI library, as
well as providing TPI and XTI header files.  The package contains all the necessary manual pages and
other documentation, including a reprint of the TPI 1.5 specification, for XTI components.  The
package is packaged as an OpenSS7 style autoconf tarball.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is a stable, production grade release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is part of the OpenSS7
Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is primarily a maintenance release.  No significant defect corrections or development
has been applied.  This release is a stable production grade release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.
Support for LiS is deprecated as of this release.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Added Network Services Library containing network selection facility as well as name-to-address
mapping functions ala ONC RPC.  This library has subsequently been moved to the `strnxsl'
package.</li>
<li>Additional features supported in all packages (see master package release notes).</li>
<!--
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new - -with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added - -disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.9 of the STREAMS X/Open Transport Interface (XTI/TLI) <em>strxnet</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package for Linux Fast-STREAMS is an implementation of the X/Open
Trasnport Interface or SVID Transport Layer Interface library in accordance with SUSv2 and XNS 5.2
standards.  It consists of user-space libraries (libxnet) and a set of cooperating STREAMS modules
(<a href="man/man2html?4+timod">timod(4)</a> and <a href="man/man2html?4+tirdwr">tirdwr(4)</a>).
The STREAMS module, timod(4), is pushed on any Stream implementing the Transport Provider Interface
(TPI) Revision 1.5 or 2.0.0 service interface and provides XTI/TLI library access to the transport
provider.  Definitions for the Transport Provider Interface (TPI) Revision 2.0.0 are also provided
by header files included in the package.

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
