strxnet-0.9.2.8 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

The STREAM XTI/TLI Library for Linunx Fast-STREAMS is an implementation
of the X/Open Transport Interface or SVID Transport Layer Interface
library in accordance with SUSv2 and XNS 5.2 standards.  It consists of
a user-space library (libxnet) and a set of cooperating STREAMS modules
(timod and tirdwr).  The STREAMS module timod is pushed on any Stream
implementing a Transport Provider Interface (TPI 2.0.0) service
interface and provides XTI/TLI library access to the transport provider.

This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate release of the OpenSS7
STREAMS XTI/TLI Library and modules that were formerly present in the
(now deprecated) Linux STREAMS (LiS) package.  These networking modules
provide TPI and XTI/TLI Library (libxnet), as well as providing TPI and
XTI header files.  The package contains all the necessary manual pages
and other documentation for XTI components in a separate autoconf
tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).
This is primarily a maintenance release.  Validated for operation on
x86_64 SMP kernel using Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Changes included to handle
__LP64__ kernels.  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels
as reported on mailing list.  Corrects one bug from inspection.  It
includes:

 - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support
   32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary
   compatibility should not have been disrupted.  At the same time as
   the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of the IO
   controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
   N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

 This is public gamma release of the package: it deprecates previous
 releases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
 releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strxns package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strxnet_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

strxnet-0.9.2.9 was released under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

The OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package for Linux Fast-STREAMS is an
implementation of the X/Open Trasnport Interface or SVID Transport Layer
Interface library in accordance with SUSv2 and XNS 5.2 standards.  It
consists of user-space libraries (libxnet) and a set of cooperating
STREAMS modules (timod(4) and tirdwr(4)).  The STREAMS module, timod(4),
is pushed on any Stream implementing the Transport Provider Interface
(TPI) Revision 1.5 or 2.0.0 service interface and provides XTI/TLI
library access to the transport provider.  Definitions for the Transport
Provider Interface (TPI) Revision 2.0.0 are also provided by header
files included in the package.

This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate release of the OpenSS7
XTI/TLI Networking that were formerly part of the strinet package.
These networking modules provide TPI and XTI/TLI library, as well as
providing TPI and XTI header files.  The package contains all the
necessary manual pages and other documentation, including a reprint of
the TPI 1.5 specification, for XTI components.  The package is packaged
as an OpenSS7 style autoconf tarball.

This release is a stable, production grade release for Linux Fast-
STREAMS and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  No significant defect
corrections or development has been applied.  This release is a stable
production release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is
deprecated as of this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Added Network Services Library containing network selection
     facility as well as name-to-address mapping functions ala ONC RPC.
     This library has subsequently been moved to the `strnxsl' package.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     `strxnet' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new --with-optimize option
     to configure to accomplish this.

   - Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

 This is a public production release of the package: it deprecates
 previous releases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with
 previous releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strxns package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strxnet_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strxnet-0.9.2.9/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strxnet.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strxnet_manual.html>).
