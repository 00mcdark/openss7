strxnet-0.9.2.8 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

The STREAM XTI/TLI Library for Linunx Fast-STREAMS is an implementation
of the X/Open Transport Interface or SVID Transport Layer Interface
library in accordance with SUSv2 and XNS 5.2 standards.  It consists of
a user-space library (libxnet) and a set of cooperating STREAMS modules
(timod and tirdwr).  The STREAMS module timod is pushed on any Stream
implementing a Transport Provider Interface (TPI 2.0.0) service
interface and provides XTI/TLI library access to the transport provider.

This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate release of the OpenSS7
STREAMS XTI/TLI Library and modules that were formerly present in the
(now deprecated) Linux STREAMS (LiS) package.  These networking modules
provide TPI and XTI/TLI Library (libxnet), as well as providing TPI and
XTI header files.  The package contains all the necessary manual pages
and other documentation for XTI components in a separate autoconf
tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).
This is primarily a maintenance release.  Validated for operation on
x86_64 SMP kernel using Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Changes included to handle
__LP64__ kernels.  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels
as reported on mailing list.  Corrects one bug from inspection.  It
includes:

 - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support
   32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary
   compatibility should not have been disrupted.  At the same time as
   the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of the IO
   controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
   N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

 This is public gamma release of the package: it deprecates previous
 releases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
 releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strxns package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strxnet_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strxnet-0.9.2.8/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strxnet.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strxnet_manual.html>).
