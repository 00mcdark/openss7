Package strxnet-0.9.2.9 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package for Linux Fast-STREAMS is an
implementation of the X/Open Trasnport Interface or SVID Transport Layer
Interface library in accordance with SUSv2 and XNS 5.2 standards.  It
consists of user-space libraries (libxnet) and a set of cooperating
STREAMS modules (timod(4) and tirdwr(4)).  The STREAMS module, timod(4),
is pushed on any Stream implementing the Transport Provider Interface
(TPI) Revision 1.5 or 2.0.0 service interface and provides XTI/TLI
library access to the transport provider.  Definitions for the Transport
Provider Interface (TPI) Revision 2.0.0 are also provided by header
files included in the package.

The package contains the following standard Open Systems Interconnect
(OSI) conforming header files:

     - <sys/tiusr.h>         TPI Version 2.0.0 user
     - <sys/tihdr.h>         TPI Version 2.0.0 kernel
     - <sys/ticots.h>        TPI COTS
     - <sys/ticots_ord.h>    TPI COTS w/ Orderly Release
     - <sys/ticlts.h>        TPI CLTS
     - <xti.h>               XTI/TLI Library
     - <xti_inet.h>          XTI/TLI Library

Note that the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) and Network Provider
Interface are contained in the strxns-0.9.2.4 package.

The package builds and installs the following STREAMS kernel modules and
drivers:

     - streams_timod.ko module "timod"
     - streams_tirdwr.ko module "tirdwr"

timod(4)
     a STREAMS XTI/TLI compatibility interface.

tirdwr(4)
     a STREAMS XTI/TLI read write compatibility module.

The package builds and installs the following shared object and static
libraries:

libxnet(3)
     XNS 5.2 XTI/TLI Library (libxnet)


The OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
XTI/TLI Networking protocol stack components and applications for the
SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate release of the OpenSS7
XTI/TLI Networking package whose components were formerly part of the
`strinet' package.  These networking modules provide TPI and XTI/TLI
library, as well as providing TPI and XTI header files.  The package
contains all the necessary manual pages and other documentation,
including a reprint of the TPI 1.5 specification, for XTI components.
The package is packaged as an OpenSS7 style autoconf tarball.

This release is a stable, production grade release for Linux
Fast-STREAMS and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  No significant defect
corrections or development has been applied.  This release is a stable
production release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is
deprecated as of this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Added Network Services Library containing network selection
     facility as well as name-to-address mapping functions ala ONC RPC.
     This library has subsequently been moved to the `strnxsl' package.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     `strxnet' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strxnet package page (http://www.openss7.org/strxnet_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strxnet-0.9.2.9/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strxnet-0.9.2.9/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `strxnet.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/strxnet_manual.html).
