 *
 *	The XTI/TLI Library has quite a history.  There was originally a TLI
 *	Library (Transport Layer Interface) in SVR3 or SVR4.  This is one of
 *	the interfaces that was placed under X/Open by Novell, the
 *	specification of which is currently managed by the OpenGroup.  The
 *	older TLI library had sys/tihdr.h, tihdr.h, sys/tiuser.h, tiuser.h
 *	header files describing the interface.  The newer XTI library has
 *	sys/tpi.h, sys/xti.h, xti.h header files describing the interface.
 *	Extension files such as xti_inet.h, sys/xti_inet.h describe additional
 *	protocol corrigendum for XTI.
