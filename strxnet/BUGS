5.5.1 Defect Notices
--------------------

"OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking" could possibly contain unknown defects.
This is a "production" release.  Nevertheless, some remaining unknown
defects could possibly be harmful.  Validation testing has been
performed by the `OpenSS7 Project' and external entities on this
software for the set of systems listed in the release notes.
Nevertheless, the software might still fail to configure or compile on
other systems.  The `OpenSS7 Project' recommends that you validate this
software for your target system before using this software.  Use at
your own risk.  Remember that there is NO WARRANTY.(1)

This software is production software.  As such, it is stable on
validated systems but might still crash your kernel in unique
circumstances.  Installation of the software on a non-validated
distribution might mangle your header files or Linux distribution in
such a way as to make it unusable.  Crashes could possibly lock your
system and rebooting the system might not repair the problem.  You can
possibly loose all the data on your system.  Because this software
stands a chance of crashing your kernel, the resulting unstable system
could possibly destroy computer hardware or peripherals making them
unusable.  You might void the warranty on any system on which you run
this software.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

manual.

5.5.2 Known Defects
-------------------

With the exception of packages not originaly created by the `OpenSS7
Project', the `OpenSS7 Project' software does not ship with known bugs
in any release stage except "pre-alpha".  "OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking"
had no known bugs at the time of release.

5.5.3 Defect History
--------------------

This section contains historical bugs that were encountered during
development and their resolutions.  This list serves two purposes:

  1. It captures bugs encountered between releases during development
     that could possibly reoccur (and the Moon is made of blue cheese).
     It therefore provides a place for users to look if they encounter
     a problem.

  2. It provides a low overhead bug list between releases for
     developers to use as a `TODO' list.
