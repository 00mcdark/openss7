@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.2.21
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.2.21
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.2.21

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream version
only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All @cite{RPM}
release numbers will be @samp{-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)} and all @cite{Debian}
release numbers will be @samp{_0}.  If you wish to apply patches and relelease
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable release
suffix for your organization.  We leave @cite{Debian} release number @samp{_1}
reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the @file{.dsc}
file.

Improved build process.

Not publicly released.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.2.20-1
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-0.2.20-1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.2.20-1

The @cite{OpenSS7 Linux Native SCTP} existed before as a kernel patch for the
Linux kernel.  This is an @command{autoconf/rpm} packaging release of
@cite{Linux Native SCTP} that builds and installs separate from the Linux
kernel tree.

Not publicly released.
