.SH "NAME"
sctp \- SCTP protocol.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fB#include <sys/socket.h>\fR
.br
\fB#include <netinet/in.h>\fR
.sp
\fBsctp_socket = socket(PF_INET, \fISOCK_STREAM\fB, IPPROTO_SCTP);
.sp
\fBsctp_socket = socket(PF_INET, \fISOCK_SEQPACKET\fB, IPPROTO_SCTP);
.sp
\fBsctp_socket = socket(PF_INET, \fISOCK_RDM\fB, IPPROTO_SCTP);

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is an implementation of the SCTP (Stream Tranmission Control Protocol)
defined in RFC2960 with a TCP-compatible \fISOCK_STREAM\fR socket interface
similar to draft-stewart-sigtran-sctpsocket-01.  SCTP provides reliable
delivery or sequenced or unsequenced packets over a full duplex connection
between two sockets on top of \fBip\fR(7).  SCTP can guarantee that the data
arrives in order on a stream if requested and retransmits lost packets.
It generates and checks a per packet checksum to catch transmission errors.
SCTP \fISOCK_SEQPACKET\fR sockets preserve message boundaries, Nagle at the
association level, and provide sequenced and unsequenced reliable delivery;
\fISOCK_RDM\fR sockets preserve message boundaries, do not Nagle, and provide
only unsequenced but reliable delivery; \fISOCK_STREAM\fR sockets do not
preserve message boundaries and Nagle at the stream level similar to
\fBtcp\fR(7).

A fresh SCTP socket has no remote or local address and is not fully specified.
To create an outgoing SCTP association use \fBconnect\fR(2) to establish an
association with another SCTP endpoint.  To receive incoming associations
\fBbind\fR(2) the socket first to a number of local addresses and a port and
then call \fBlisten\fR(2) to put the socket into listening state.  After that a
new socket for each incoming association can be accepted using \fBaccept\fR(2).
A socket which has had \fBaccept\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2) successfully called on it
is fully specified and may transmit data.  Data cannot be transmitted on
listening or not yet connected sockets.

SCTP supports large TCP windows to support links with high latency or
bandwidth.  Large SCTP windows can be used by increasing the send and receive
buffer sizes.  They can be set globally with the \fBnet.core.wmem_default\fR
and \fBnet.core.rmem_default\fR sysctls, or on individual sockets by using the
\fBSO_SNDBUF\fR and \fBSO_RCVBUF\fR socket options.  The maximum sizes for
socket buffers are limitied by the global \fBnet.core.wmem_max\fR and
\fBnet.core.rmem_max\fR sysctls.  See \fBsocket\fR(7) for more information.
.PP
When sending data, the specific destination address within the association
to use for a multi-homed host can be specified by providing a valid destination
address as an argument to \fBsendto\fR(2) or \fBsendmsg\fR(2).  Data sent with
\fBsend\fR(2) or \fBwrite\fR(2) will use SCTP's destination transport address
selection policies for transmission and retransmission.  The stream upon which
to send the data can also be set with the \fISCTP_SID\fR socket option on a
socket basis with \fBsetsockopt\fR(2) or on a per-message basis with
\fBsendmsg\fR(2).
.PP
For \fISOCK_SEQPACKET\fR socket, send operations may also use the
\fBMSG_MORE\fR flag when sending with \fBsendmsg\fR(2) to indicate that the
next write operation will provide additional data belonging to the same
packet.
.PP
For \fISOCK_SEQPACKET\fR and \fISOCK_RDM\fR sockets, all receive operations
return only one packet, or a portion of one packet.  When the packet is
smaller than the passed buffer only that much data is returned, when it is
bigger the packet is truncated and the \fBMSG_TRUNC\fR flag is set.
Subsequent \fBrecv\fR or \fBread\fB(2), or a subsequent \fBrecvfrom\fR(2) or
\fBrecgmsg\fR for the same stream will return the remainder of the packet.
SCTP \fISOCK_SEQPACKET\fR and \fISOCK_RDM\fR sockets return the \fBMSG_EOR\fR
flag when the end of the packet has been received successfully and
\fBMSG_TRUNC\fR when it has not.
.PP
For \fISOCK_STREAM\fR sockets, all receive operations return only the amount of
data available on the current stream.  \fBMSG_TRUNC\fR and \fBMSG_EOR\fR are
never set for \fISOCK_STREAM\fR sockets.
.PP
IP options may be sent or received using the socket options described in
\fBip\fR(7).  They are only processed by the kernel when the appropriate sysctl
is enable (but still passed to the user even when it is turned off).  See
\fBip\fR(7).
.PP
When the \fBMSG_DONTROUTE\fR flag is set on sending, the destination address
must refer to a local interface address and the packet is only sent to that
interface.
.PP
SCTP fragments a packet when its total length exceeds the association MTU
(Maximum Transmission Unit).  A more network friendly alternative is to use path
MTU discovery as described in the \fBIP_PMTU_DISCOVER\fR section of \fBip\fR(7).
.PP
SCTP supports urgent data similar to TCP.  Urgent data is used to signal the
receiver that some important message is part of the data stream and that it
should be processed as soon as possible.  Urgent data is always sent out of
order.  To send urgent (or out of order) data specify the \fBMSG_OOB\fR option
to \fBsend\fR(2), \fBsendto\fR(2), or \fBsendmsg\fR(2).  When urgent data is
received, the kernel sends a \fBSIGURG\fR signal to the reading process or the
process or process group that has been set for the socket using the
\fBFIOCSPGRP\fR or \fBFIOCSETOWN\fR ioctls.  When the \fBSO_OOBINLINE\fR socket
option is enabled, urgent data is put into the normal data stream (and can be
tested for by the \fBSIOCATMARK\fR ioctl), otherwise it can be only received
when the \fBMSG_OOB\fR flag is set for \fBrecvmsg\fR(2).
.SH "ADDRESS FORMATS"
SCTP is built on top of IP (see \fBip\fR(7)).  The address formats defined by
\fBip\fR(7) apply to SCTP.  SCTP uses the IPv4 \fIsockaddr_in\fR address format
described in \fBip\fR(7).
.PP
SCTP supports multiple-stream point-to-point communication within multi-homed
associations; broadcasting and multicasting are not supported.
.PP
In addition to normal IP addressing, SCTP provides extensions on the
\fBbind\fR(2), \fBaccept\fR, \fBconnect\fR(2), \fBgetsockname\fR(2), and
\fBgetpeername\fR(2) system calls.  These functions normally take or return a
single \fIsockaddr_in\fR as an address argument.  When used in conjunction
with a SCTP socket on or to a multi-homed host, these calls will accept or
return an array of \fIsockaddr_in\fR structures.  The number of addresses in
the structure is indicated by the length of the structure and the protocol
family of the socket.  SCTP will only support one port number being specified
in the address list.  (Note: Linux only provides MAX_SOCK_ADDR as a maximum
size of the socket address length.  This is current 128 bytes or 8
\fIsockaddr_in\fR structures.)

Multiple addresses provided to the \fBbind\fR(2) system call will be
interpreted as multiple local addresses to provide to the peer at connection
time as well as the local address/port combinations upon which a listening
socket will accept incoming associations.  A call to \fBaccept\fR(2)
requesting the source address of the peer will return multiple transport
addresses if the connecting peer is multihomed.  Multiple addresses provided
to the \fBconnect\fR(2) system call will be interpreted as multiple
destination address/port combinations to which to form an association. The
\fBgetpeername\fR(2) system call returns the list of destination address/port
combinations to which the socket is connected.  The \fBgetsockname\fR(2)
system call returnes the list of local address/port combinations to which the
socket is bound.
.SH "SYSCTLS"
These sysctls can be accessed by the \fB/proc/sys/net/ipv4/*\fR files or with
the \fBsysctl\fR(2) interface.  In addition, most SCOKET and IP sysctls also
apply to SCTP; see \fBsocket\fR(7) and \fBip\fR(7).
.TP
\fBsctp_max_istreams\fR
Defines the default maximum number of inbound SCTP streams that will be
requested when forming or receiving connections on an SCTP socket.  This is a
default value.  The actual value used by a socket for both ougoing and
incoming connections can be changed with the SCTP option
\fISCTP_ISTREAMS\fR before a call to \fBlisten\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2).
.TP
\fBsctp_req_ostreams\fR
Defines the default requested number of outbound SCTP streams that will be
requested when forming or receiving connections on an SCTP socket.  This is a
default value.  The actual value used by a socket for both ougoing and
incoming connections can be changed with the SCTP option
\fISCTP_OSTREAMS\fR before a call to \fBlisten\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2).
.TP
\fBsctp_rto_initial\fR
Defines the time interval (in milliseconds) which will be used as an initial RTO
(Retransmission Time Out) value when sending packets to a destination for the
first time.  Valid values are zero or greater and must be within the range
from \fIsctp_rto_min\fR to \fIsctp_rto_max\fR.  The default value is the value
recommended in RFC 2960 (3,000 milliseconds).  (Note: this is only a default
value which will be assigned to new destinations.  Each destination can be
controlled with the socket option \fISCTP_RTO\fR or \fISCTP_RTO_INITIAL\fR
described below under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.)
.TP
\fBsctp_rto_min\fR
Defines the time interval (in milliseconds) which will be used as a RTO
(Retransmission Time Out) value when sending packets.  Valid values must be the
number of milliseconds in a tick (1000/HZ) or greater and must be less than or
equal to the value of \fIsctp_rto_max\fR. The default value is the value
recommended in RFC 2960 (1,000 milliseconds).  (Note: this is only a default
value which will be assigned to new destinations.  Each destination can be
controlled with the socket option \fISCTP_RTO\fR or \fISCTP_RTO_MIN\fR
described below under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.)
.TP
\fBsctp_rto_max\fR
Defines the time interval (in milliseconds) which will be used as a RTO
(Retransmission Time Out) value when sending packets.  Valid values must be the
number of milliseconds in a tick (1000/HZ) or greater and must be greater than
or equal to the value of \fIsctp_rto_min\fR.  The default value is the value
recommended in RFC 2960 (60,000 milliseconds).  (Note: this is only a default
value which will be assigned to new destinations.  Each destination can be
controlled with the socket option \fISCTP_RTO\fR or \fISCTP_RTO_MAX\fR
described below under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.)
.TP
\fBsctp_valid_cookie_life\fR
Defines the time interval (in seconds) beyond which a COOKIE ECHO with a cookie
sent in an INIT ACK will no longer be accepted.  Valid values are 1 second or
greater.  The default value is the value recommended in RFC 2960 (60 seconds).
The value for a given socket can be changed with the socket option
\fISCTP_COOKIE_LIFE\fR as described under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.
.TP
\fBsctp_max_sack_delay\fR
Defines the interval of time (in milliseconds) that the sending endpoint
is permitted to delay an acknowledgement of a received data chunk.  Valid values
are in the range from 1 to 500 milliseconds.  (RFC 2960 forbids setting this
value larger than 500 milliseconds.)  The default value is the value recommended
in RFC 2960 (200 milliseconds).
The value for a given socket can be changed with the socket option
\fISCTP_SACK_DELAY\fR as described under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.
.TP
\fBsctp_path_max_retrans\fR
Defines the number of times that the sending SCTP endpoint will attempt
retransmitting a packet on to a given destination transport address before it
considers that destination transport address inactive.  Valid values include
zero.  The default value is the value recommended in RFC 2960 (5 retries).
(Note: this is only a default value which will be assigned to new destinations.
Each destination can be controlled with the socket option \fISCTP_RTO\fR
or \fISCTP_PATH_MAX_RETRANS\fR
described below under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.)
.TP
\fBsctp_assoc_max_retrans\fR
Defines the number of times that the sending SCTP endpoint will attempt
retransmitting a packet on a given association before it aborts the association.
Valid values include zero.  The default value is the value recommended in RFC
2960 (10 retries).  This value should be larger than the sum of all of the
\fIpath_max_retrans\fR values of each of the destinations.
The value for a given socket can be changed with the socket option
\fISCTP_ASSOC_MAX_RETRANS\fR as described under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.
.TP
\fBsctp_max_init_retries\fR
The number of times that an SCTP INIT or COOKIE ECHO will be resent before
abandoning the association intialization.  Valid values include zero.  The
default value is the value recommended in RFC 2960 (8 retries).
The value for a given socket can be changed with the socket option
\fISCTP_MAX_INIT_RETRIES\fR as described under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.
.TP
\fBsctp_heartbeat_itvl\fR
Defines the interval (in seconds) between successive HEARTBEAT messages used to
probe destination transport address for RTT calculation and activity.  Valid
valids are 1 second or greater.  The default value is the value recommended in
RFC 2960 (30 seconds).  (Note: This is only the default value which will be
assigned to new destinations.  Each destination can be controlled with the
socket option \fISCTP_HB\fR or \fISCTP_HEARTBEAT_ITVL\fR
described below under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.)

If the kernel configuration parameter \fICONFIG_SCTP_THROTTLE_HEARTBEATS\fR is
set, then half this value is also used for throttling heartbeats.  Then only two
heartbeats per interval are permitted, any additional heartbeats are discarded.
.TP
\fBsctp_mac_type\fR
Defines the MAC (Message Authentication Code) type which will be used when
signing cookies in INIT ACK messages.  Valid values are \fISCTP_HMAC_SHA_1\fR,
for the FIPS 180-1 Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-1 HMAC, \fISCTP_HMAC_MD5\fR, for
the RFC 1321 Message Digest 5 HMAC, and \fISCTP_HMAC_NONE\fR, for no secure
signature.  There is no required value here for RFC 2960.  The default value is
(in priority of availability) \fISCTP_HMAC_MD5\fR, \fISCTP_HMAC_SHA_1\fR, then
\fISCTP_HMAC_NONE\fR.  SHA-1 performs well on big-endian machines, MD5 performs
well on little-endian machines.  Whether either of these can be selected depends
on the kernel configuration parameters \fICONFIG_SCTP_HMAC_SHA1\fR and
\fICONFIG_SCTP_HMAC_MD5\fR.
The MAC for a given socket can be changed before the \fBlisten\fR(2) call with
the socket option \fISCTP_MAC_TYPE\fR as described under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.
.TP
\fBsctp_cookie_inc\fR
Defines the time increment (in milliseconds) which will be added to the lifespan
of the cookie in an INIT ACK if the received INIT requests cookie preservative
to lengthen the lifespan of the cookie.  Valid values include zero.  The
default value is the value recommended in RFC 2960 5.2.6 (1 second).
The cookie lifetime increment for a given socket can be changed before the
\fBlisten\fR(2) call with the socket option \fISCTP_COOKIE_INC\fR as described
under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.
.TP
\fBsctp_throttle_itvl\fR
Defines the interval (in milliseconds) within which the SCTP receiver will not
accept more than one INIT or COOKIE ECHO.  Zero (don't throttle) is a valid
value.  The default value is 50 milliseconds.  When the HMAC type is SHA-1 or
MD5, the implementation is vulnerable to DoS flood attacks using INIT or COOKIE
ECHO messages.  When SCTP is compiled with
\fICONFIG_SCTP_THROTTLE_PASSIVEOPENS\fR, this permits the throttling of INIT and
COOKIE ECHO messages.  Only one INIT and one COOKIE ECHO message will be
accepted in the interval set by this control.
The throttle interval for a given socket can be changed before the
\fBlisten\fR(2) call with the socket option \fISCTP_THROTTLE_ITVL\fR as
described under \fBSOCKET OPTIONS\fR.
.TP
\fBsctp_checksum_algorithm\fR
Defines the checksum algorithm which will be used when checksumming packets.
Valie values are \fISCTP_CSUM_ADLER_32\fR for the RFC 2960 Appendix B
algorithm and \fISCTP_CSUM_CRC_32C\fR for the draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpcsum-06.txt
CRC-32C checksum algorithm.  This value may also be set for a given socket
using the \fISCTP_CKSUM_TYPE\fR socket option described below.
.TP
\fBsctp_wmem
Defines three values (lower, default, upper) for the socket write buffer.  The
value associated with a given socket can also be changed with
the \fISO_SNDBUF\fR option, see \fBsocket\fR(7).
.TP
\fBsctp_rmem
Defines three values (lower, default, upper) for the socket read buffer.  The
value associated with a given socket can also be changed with
the \fISO_RCVBUF\fR option, see \fBsocket\fR(7).
.SH "SOCKET_OPTIONS"
To set or get a SCTP socket option, call \fBgetsockopt\fR(2) to read or
\fBsetsockopt\fR(2) to write the option with the socket family argument set to
\fBSOL_SCTP\fR.  In addition, most \fBSOL_SOCKET\fR and \fBSOL_IP\fR socket
options are valid on SCTP sockets.  For more information see \fBsocket\fR(7)
and
\fBip\fR(7).
.TP
.B SCTP_NODELAY
Turn the Nagle algorithm off.  This means that packets are always sent as soon
as possible and no unnecessary delays are introduced, at the cost of more
packets in the network.  Expects an integer boolean flag.

This parallels the \fITCP_NODELAY\fR socket option for compatibility with
\fBtcp\fR(7).  \fISCTP_NODELAY\fR and \fITCP_NODELAY\fR can be used
interchangeably.  For \fISOCK_STREAM\fR sockets, this setting applies to the
default stream as set the \fISCTP_SID\fR socket option.  For regular
\fISOCK_SEQPACKET\fR sockets, this setting applies to the entire
association.  This option has no effect on \fISOCK_RDM\fR sockets.
.TP
.B SCTP_MAXSEG
Set or receive the maximum segment size for outgoing packets.  Values
greater than the association MTU are ignored and have no effect.

This parallels the \fITCP_MAXSEG\fR socket option for compatibility with
\fBtcp\fR(7).  \fISCTP_MAXSEG\fR and \fITCP_MAXSEG\fR can be used
interchangeably.  This option is only applicable to \fISOCK_STREAM\fR sockets,
where the setting applies to the default stream as set with the \fISCTP_SID\fR
socket option.
.TP
.B SCTP_CORK
If enabled don't send out partial frames.  All queued partial frames are sent
when the option is cleared again.
This is useful for prepending headers before calling \fBsendfile\fR(2),
or for throughput optimization.  This option cannot be combined with
\fISCTP_NODELAY\fR.

This parallels the \fITCP_CORK\fR socket option for compatibility with
\fBtcp\fR(7).  \fISCTP_CORK\fR and \fITCP_CORK\fR can be used interchangeably.
For \fISOCK_STREAM\fR sockets, this setting applies to the default stream as set
by the \fISCTP_SIB\fR socket option.  For regular \fISOCK_SEQPACKET\fR sockets,
this setting applies to the entire association.  This option has no effect on
\fISOCK_RDM\fR sockets.

.TP
.B SCTP_SID
Set or receive the default stream identifier for all outgoing packets.  If
\fISCTP_SID\fR is passed to \fBsendmsg\fR(2) then the outgoing packet will be
sent over the stream specified by the integer stream identifier contained in the
ancillary message.

This setting also determines the default stream identifier for
\fISCTP_NODELAY\fR, \fISCTP_MAXSEG\fR, and \fISCTP_CORK\fR options for
\fISOCK_STREAM\fR sockets.
.TP
.B SCTP_PPI
Set or get the payload protocol identifier for all outgoing packets.  If
\fISCTP_PPI\fR is passed to \fBsendmsg(\fR(2) then the outgoing packet will be
sent with the payload protocol identifier specified by the integer payload
protocol identifier contains in the ancillary message.
.TP
.B SCTP_RECVSID
When this flag is set pass a \fISCTP_SID\fR control message with the stream
identifier for received packets as an integer in an ancillary message which
may be received with \fBrecvmsg\fR(2).
.TP
.B SCTP_RECVPPI
When this flag is set pass a \fISCTP_PPI\fR control message with the payload protocol
identifier for received packets as an integer in an ancillary message which may
be received with \fBrecvmsg\fR(2).
.TP
.B SCTP_HB
Set or receive the heartbeat activation and interval associated with the
specified destination address. The expected value is a \fBsctp_hbitvl\fR
structure.

.RS
.nf
    struct sctp_hbitvl {
        struct sockaddr_in
              dest;   /* destination IP address */
        uint  active; /* activation flag */
        uint  itvl;   /* interval in milliseconds */
    };
.fi
.RE
.IP
\fIdest\fR is a \fBsockaddr_in\fR structure which contains the destination
address to which the heartbeat setting applies.  \fIactive\fR is an integer
boolean activation flag indicating whether heartbeat is active on the
destination.  \fIitvl\fR is the integer heartbeat interval in milliseconds.
.TP
.B SCTP_RTO
Set or receive the retransmission timeout parameters associated with the
specified desination address.  The expected value is a \fBsctp_rtoval\fR
structure.

.RS
.nf
    struct sctp_rtoval {
        struct sockaddr_in
              dest;        /* destination IP address     */
        uint  rto_initial; /* RTO.Initial (milliseconds) */
        uint  rto_min;     /* RTO.Min     (milliseconds) */
        uint  rto_max;     /* RTO.Max     (milliseconds) */
        uint  max_retrans; /* Path.Max.Retrans (retries) */
    };
.fi
.RE
.IP
\fIdest\fR is a \fBsockaddr_in\fR structure which contains the destination
address to which the rto parameter setting applies.  \fIrto_initial\fR is the
integer initial retransmission timeout value in milliseconds.  \fIrto_min\fR is
the integer minimum retransmission timeout value in milliseconds.  \fIrto_max\fR
is the integer maximum retransmission timeout value in milliseconds.
\fImax_retrans\fR is the integer maximum number of retransmissions.
.TP
.B SCTP_COOKIE_LIFE
Sets or gets the cookie lifetime associated with a socket.  This is the amount
of time that cookies sent to a peer endpoint in an INIT-ACK message will be
valid.  For Linux SCTP this also limits the maximum for which the HMAC secret
key for the cookie will be valid.  The value is a integer time interval in
milliseconds.  Valid values are from 0 to MAXINT.  The default value is set by
the sysctl \fIsctp_cookie_life\fR.  This socket option must be set before the
call to \fBlisten\fR(2).
.TP
.B SCTP_SACK_DELAY
Sets or gets the maximum SACK delay as the interval of time (in milliseconds)
that the sending enpoint will delay an acknowledgement of a received data
chunk.  Valid values are in the range from 0 to MAXINT, however, the value of
the maximum SACK delay should not exceed the maximum RTO as set by
\fISCTP_RTO_MAX\fR.  The default value is set by the sysctl
\fIsctp_sack_delay\fR.  socket option may be set at any time during the life
of the socket.
.TP
.B SCTP_PATH_MAX_RETRANS
Sets or gets the number of times that the sending SCTP endpoint will attempt
retransmitting a packet to a given destination transport address before it
consideres that desstination transport address inactive.  Valid values include
zero.  The default values is set by the sysctl \fIsctp_path_max_retrans\fR.
This is the default value assigned to destinations before the call to
\fBlisten\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2).  Active destinations can be controlled
with the \fBSCTP_RTO\fR socket option.
.TP
.B SCTP_ASSOC_MAX_RETRANS
Sets or gets the number of times that the sending SCTP endpoint will attempt
retransmitting a packet on a given association before it aborts the
association.  Valid values include zero.  The default value is set by the
sysctl \fIsctp_assoc_max_retrans\fR.  This valie should be larger than the
sumof all the \fISCTP_PATH_MAX_RETRANS\fR values of each of the destinations.
This value can be changed on an idle or active association (connection) using
this socket option.
.TP
.B SCTP_MAX_INIT_RETRIES
Sets or gets the number of times that an SCTP INIT or COOKIE ECHO will be
resent before abandoning the association initialization.  Valid values include
zero.  The default value is set by the sysctl \fIsctp_max_init_retries\fR.
This socket option must be set before the call to \fBlisten\fR(2) or
\fBconnect\fR(2).
.TP
.B SCTP_HEARTBEAT_ITVL
Sets or gets the interval (in seconds) between successive HEARTBEAT messages
use to probe destination transport addresses for RTT calculation and activity.
Valid valis are 1 second or greater.  The default value is set by the sysctl
\fIsctp_heartbeat_itvl\fR.  This is the default value which will be assigned
to new destinations.  Active destinations can be controlled with the socket
option \fISCTP_HB\fR.  This socket option must be set before the call to
\fBlisten\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2).
.TP
.B SCTP_RTO_INITIAL
Sets or gets the time interval (in milliseconds) which will be used as an
initial RTO (Retransmission Time Out) value when sending packets to a
destination for the first time.  Value values are zero or greater and must be
within the range from \fISCTP_RTO_MIN\fR to \fISCTP_RTO_MAX\fR.  The default
value is the value set by \fIsctp_rto_initial\fR.  This socket option must be
set before the call to \fBlisten\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2), but the value may
be controlled on active destination with the \fISCTP_RTO\fR socket option.
.TP
.B SCTP_RTO_MIN
Sets of gest the time interval (in milliseconds) which will be used as a
minimum RTO (Retransmission Time Out) value when sending packets.  Valid
values are zero or greater and must be less than or equal to the value of
\fISCTP_RTO_MAX\fR.  The default value is set by the sysctl
\fIsctp_rto_min\fR.  This socket option must be set before the call to
\fBlisten\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2), but the value associated with active
destinations can be controlled using the \fISCTP_RTO\fR socket option.
.TP
.B SCTP_RTO_MAX
Sets of gest the time interval (in milliseconds) which will be used as a
maximum RTO (Retransmission Time Out) value when sending packets.  Valid
values are zero or greater and must be greater than or equal to the value of
\fISCTP_RTO_MIN\fR.  The default value is set by the sysctl
\fIsctp_rto_max\fR.  This socket option must be set before the call to
\fBlisten\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2), but the value associated with active
destinations can be controlled using the \fISCTP_RTO\fR socket option.
.TP
.B SCTP_OSTREAMS
Sets the number of requested outbound streams or gets the actual number of
outbound streams associated with a connection.  Valid values are from 1 to
16,736.  The default value is set by the sysctl \fIsctp_req_ostreams\fR.  This
socket option must be set before or after the call to \fBlisten\fR(2) or
\fBconnect\fR(2) but can be read at any time.
.TP
.B SCTP_ISTREAMS
Sets the maximum number inbound streams or gets the actual number of inbound
streams associated with a connection.  Valid values are from 1 to 16,736.  The
default value is set by the sysctl \fIsctp_max_istreams\fR.  This socket
option must be set before or after the call to \fBlisten\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2) but
can be read at any time.
.TP
.B SCTP_COOKIE_INC
Sets or gets the time increment (in milliseconds) which will be added to the
lifespan of the cookie in an INIT ACK if the receive INIT request cookie
preservation to lengthen the lifespan of the cookie.  Valid values include
zero.  The default value is set by the sysctl \fIsctp_cookie_inc\fR.
This socket option must be set before or after the call to \fBlisten\fR(2) but
can be read at any time.
.TP
.B SCTP_THROTTLE_ITVL
Sets or gets the interval (in milliseconds) within which the SCTP receive will
not accept more than one INIT or COOKIE ECHO.  Zero (don't throttle) is a
valid value.  The default is set by the sysctl \fIsctp_throttle_itvl\fR.  This
socket option must be set before or after the call to \fBlisten\fR(2).
.TP
.B SCTP_MAC_TYPE
Sets or gets the MAC (Message Authentication Code) type which will be used
when signing cookies in INIT ACK messages.  Valid values are
\fISCTP_HMAC_SHA_1\fR, \fISCTP_HMAC_MD5\fR, and \fISCTP_HMAC_NONE\fR.  The
default value is set by the sysctl \fIsctp_mac_type\fR.  This socket option
must be set before or after the call to \fBlisten\fR(2).
.TP
.B SCTP_CKSUM_TYPE
Sets or gets the checksum algorithm associated with socket.  Valid values are
\fISCTP_CSUM_ADLER_32\fR and \fISCTP_CSUM_CRC_32C\fR.  The default value is
set by the sysctl \fIsctp_csum_algorithm\fR.  This socket option must be set
before the call to \fBlisten\fR(2) or \fBconnect\fR(2).

.SH "IOCTLS"
These ioctls can be accessed using
\fBioctl\fR(2).
The correct syntax is:
.PP
.RS
.nf
.BI int " value";
.IB error " = ioctl(" sctp_socket ", " ioctl_type ", &" value ");"
.fi
.RE
.TP
.B SIOCINQ
Returns the amount of queued unread data in the receive buffer.  Argument is a
pointer to an integer.
.TP
.B SIOCATMARK
Returns true when all urgent data has already been received by the user
program.  This is used together with \fBSO_OOBINLINE\fR.  Argument is a
pointer to an integer for the test result.
.TP
.B SIOCOUTQ
Returns the amount of unsent data in the socket send queue in the passed
integer value pointer.
.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
When a network error occurs, SCTP tries to resend the packet.  If it doesn't
succeed after some time, either \fBETIMEDOUT\fR or the last received error on
this connection is reported.
.PP
Some applications require a quicker error notification.  This can be enabled
with the \fBSOL_IP\fR level \fBIP_RECVERR\fR socket option.  When this option is
enabled, all incoming errors are immediately passed to the user program.  Use
this option with care \- it makes SCTP less tolerant to routing changes and
other normal network conditions.
.SH "NOTES"
When an error occurs doing a connection setup occuring in a socket write
\fBSIGPIPE\fR is only raised when the \fBSO_KEEPOPEN\fR socket option is set.

SCTP has no real out-of-band or urgent data; it has out-of-order data.  In Linux
this means if the other end sends newer out-of-band data the older urgent data
may arrive later.

If the socket option \fBSO_KEEPALIVE\fR is not set (see \fBsocket\fR(7)), SCTP
will not generate heartbeats to any destination.  For regular
\fBSOCK_SEQPACKET\fR and \fBSOCK_RDM\fR SCTP sockets, \fBSO_KEEPALIVE\fR
defaults to set.  For TCP-compatible \fBSOCK_STREAM\fR SCTP sockets,
\fBSO_KEEPALIVE\fR defaults to unset.
.SH "ERRORS"
.TP
.B EPIPE
The other end closed the socket unexpectedly or a read is executed on a shut
down socket.
.TP
.B ETIMEDOUT
The other end didn't acknowledge retransmitted data after some time.
.TP
.B EAFNOTSUPPORT
Passed socket address type in \fIsin_family\fR was not \fBAF_INET\fR.
.PP
Any errors defined for \fBip\fR(7) or the generic \fBsocket\fR(7) layer may
also be returned for SCTP.
