This is the linux-sctp-0.2.4 prerelease.  It can be obtained from the
download area of http://www.openss7.org as linux-sctp-0.2.4.tgz.

The tarball linux-sctp-0.2.4.tgz unpacks with the command

        tar -xzvf linux-sctp-0.2.4.tgz

into the following files and directories under linux-sctp-0.2.4:

        INSTALL     - Installation instructions
        LICENSE     - GNU Public License
        README      - This file
        doc         - Miscellaneous documentation
        man         - sctp.7 man page for Linux
        patch-0.2   - patch file to patch Linux 2.4.18 kernel sources
	patch-0.2.1 - additional patch file
	patch-0.2.2 - additional patch file
	patch-0.2.3 - additional patch file
	patch-0.2.4 - additional patch file
        test        - Test files and Ethereal dumps from ETSI bakeoff.

The patch for the Linux 2.4.18 kernel is in the file patch-0.2  This
patch may work with other kernel sources with some manual manipulation.
Start with a full copy of the true Linux 2.4.18 kernel sources in a
separate directory in case anything goes wrong during the patching
process.

If you kernel sources are in the directory /usr/src/linux-2.4.18 and the
patch file is in ~/linux-sctp-0.2 use the patch command as follows to
patch the linux kernel sources in /usr/src/linux-2.4.18

        cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.18
        gzip -dc ~/linux-sctp-0.2/patch-0.2.gz | patch -p0

Then the additional patches should be applied as follows:

        gzip -dc ~/linux-sctp-0.2/patch-0.2.1.gz | patch -p0
        gzip -dc ~/linux-sctp-0.2/patch-0.2.2.gz | patch -p0
        gzip -dc ~/linux-sctp-0.2/patch-0.2.3.gz | patch -p0
        gzip -dc ~/linux-sctp-0.2/patch-0.2.4.gz | patch -p0

Note: make sure that you do not have the environment variable
POSIXLY_CORRECT set or this patch will not apply correctly.  For csh do:

        unsetenv POSIXLY_CORRECT

before applying the patch.

Once the kernel sources are compiled, you can configure, compile and
install the kernel as usual.  The kernel will install as
vmlinuz-2.4.18-sctp and the sctp modules will be installed in
/lib/modules/2.4.18-sctp so that they can be kept separate from other
kernel versions.

The kernel sources compile nicely on RH7.2 systems.

When configuring the kernel, there are a number of new configuration
options for SCTP under networking options.  They are:

Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
CONFIG_SCTP
   This provides support for the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
   (SCTP) RFC 2960 operation.  Those requiring use of the SCTP should
   say Y here.  See "linux/Documentation/sctp.txt" for more information.
   This is EXPERIMENTAL code which could break TCP/IP in mysterious ways.
   If unsure, just say N.

Slow Verification
CONFIG_SCTP_SLOW_VERIFICATION
   When a message comes from an SCTP endpoint with the correct verification
   tag, it is not necessary to check whether it is from a correct source
   address to identify the SCTP association to which it belongs.  When you
   say N here, source addresses are not checked and it is up to firewall
   implementations to thwart attackers of the verification tag.  When you
   say Y here, you get RFC 2960 compliant operation, but at a great cost to
   SCTP performance.

Throttle Heartbeats
CONFIG_SCTP_THROTTLE_HEARTBEATS
   Special feature of Linux SCTP which is not mentioned in RFC 2960.
   When you say Y here, SCTP will throttle the rate at which it responds
   to heartbeats to the system control heartbeat_interval.  This makes
   SCTP more resilient to implementations which flood heartbeat messages.
   For RFC 2960 compliant operation, say N here.

Discard Out of the Blue Packets
CONFIG_SCTP_DISCARD_OOTB
   RFC 2960 permits the implementation to discard all OOTB packets
   (packets for which no SCTP association exists).  It say that the
   implementation SHOULD send ABORT to some packets.  Sending ABORT
   chunks to unverified source addresses with the T bit set opens
   SCTP to blind masquerade attacks.  Not sending them may lead to
   delays at the peer endpoint aborting associations where our ABORT
   has been lost and the socket is already closed (SCTP does not 
   have the TIME_WAIT state of TCP).  If you say Y here, SCTP will
   discard all OOTB packets (higher security).  If you say N here,
   SCTP will reply with ABORT to OOTB packets defined in Section 8.4
   of RFC 2960 with the exception of SHUTDOWN ACK.  If in doubt,
   say Y here.  If a peer implementation experiences difficulties
   aborting associations, try saying N.

TCP Compatible Streams
CONFIG_SCTP_TCP_COMPATIBLE
   draft-stewart-sigtran-sctpsocket-01.txt describes some ways to
   permit SCTP sockets to be TCP compatible.  If you say Y here, then
   you can open a SOCK_STREAM socket with IPPROTO_SCTP which will
   be compatible at the socket level with TCP.  If you say N here,
   this feature is disabled.  If in doubt, say Y.

Extended IP Support for SCTP
CONFIG_SCTP_EXTENDED_IP_SUPPORT
   This provides extended IP support for SCTP for things like IP
   Transparent Proxy and IP Masquerading.  This is experimental
   stuff.  If in doubt, say N.

SCTP HMAC Algorithm SHA-1
CONFIG_SCTP_HMAC_SHA1
   This provides the ability to use the FIPS 180-1 (SHA-1) message
   authentication code in SCTP cookies.  If you say Y here, when the
   appropriate sysctl is set, SCTP will use the SHA-1 HMAC when signing
   cookies in the INIT ACK chunk.  If you say N here, the SHA-1 HMAC
   will be unavailable for use with SCTP.  If in doubt, say N.

SCTP HMAC Algorithm MD5
CONFIG_SCTP_HMAC_MD5
   This provides the ability to use the MD5 (RFC 1321) message
   authentication code in SCTP cookies.  If you say Y here, when the
   appropriate sysctl is set, SCTP will use the MD5 HMAC when signing
   cookies in the INIT ACK chunk.  If you say N here, the MD5 HMAC will
   be unavailable for use with SCTP.  If in doubt, say Y.

SCTP Adler 32 Checksum
CONFIG_SCTP_ADLER_32
   This provides the ability to use the older RFC 2960 Adler32
   checksum.  If CONFIG_SCTP_CRC_32 below is not selected, the Adler32
   checksum is always provided.  If in doubt, say Y.

SCTP CRC-32c Checksum
CONFIG_SCTP_CRC_32C
   This provides the ability to use the newer CRC-32c checksum as
   described in draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpcsum-06.txt.  When this is
   selected and CONFIG_SCTP_ADLER_32 is not selected above, then
   the only checksum that will be used is the CRC-32c checksum.
   If in doubt, say Y.

Throttle Passive Opens
CONFIG_SCTP_THROTTLE_PASSIVEOPENS
   Special feature of Linux SCTP mentioned in RFC 2960.  When secure
   algorithms are used for signing cookies, the implementation becomes
   vulnerable to INIT and COOKIE ECHO flooding.  If you say Y here,
   SCTP will only allow one INIT and one COOKE ECHO to be processed
   in each interval corresponding to the sysctl throttle_itvl.  Setting
   throttle_itvl to 0 defeats this function.  If you say N here, each
   INIT and COOKIE ECHO will be processed.

SCTP Debugging
CONFIG_SCTP_DEBUG
   This provides a verbose amount of debugging information to fill up
   your system logs.  If in doubt, say N.

SCTP Safe Mode
CONFIG_SCTP_SAFE
   This compiles in a number of assertions and checks that make SCTP
   run a little safer and will print a little more debugging
   information.  If in doubt, say Y.

SCTP Error Generator
CONFIG_SCTP_ERROR_GENERATOR
   This provides an internal error generator that can be accessed
   with socket options for testing SCTP operation under packet loss.
   You will need this option to run some of the test programs distributed
   with the SCTP module.  If in doubt, say N.

I set these as follows:

	CONFIG_SCTP=m

	#
	# SCTP Configuration
	#
	# CONFIG_SCTP_SLOW_VERIFICATION is not set
	# CONFIG_SCTP_THROTTLE_HEARTBEATS is not set
	# CONFIG_SCTP_DISCARD_OOTB is not set
	CONFIG_SCTP_TCP_COMPATIBLE=y
	# CONFIG_SCTP_EXTENDED_IP_SUPPORT is not set
	CONFIG_SCTP_HMAC_SHA1=y
	CONFIG_SCTP_HMAC_MD5=y
	CONFIG_SCTP_ADLER_32=y
	CONFIG_SCTP_CRC_32C=y
	# CONFIG_SCTP_THROTTLE_PASSIVEOPENS is not set
	CONFIG_SCTP_SAFE=y
	CONFIG_SCTP_ERROR_GENERATOR=y

Once you compile install and reboot on the new kernel, you will be able
to open SCTP sockets.  If you configure SCTP as a module (as I do), the
module will be loaded on demand when an SCTP socket is opened.

Header files are included in the package (in include).  These files can
either be included with:

	#include <netinet/sctp.h>
        #include <linux/sysctl.h>

and either placed in your /usr/src/include/ subdirectories or included
with a compile line command such as:

	gcc -I~/linux-sctp-0.2.4/include -o test test.c

Read the SCTP man page (in man/sctp.7) and look at the test programs
under the test directory.  You can place the manual page in you man
directory, such as /usr/local/share/man/man7 so that it is available
to your system, or just view it with less or man -f.

To compile the test programs just change to the test program directory
and type make:

        cd ~/linux-sctp-0.2.4/test
        make
