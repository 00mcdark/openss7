* Major changes in sctp-0.2.22

  This is primarily a bug fixes release and corrections resulting from
  testing.  This is a major bug fix release.  The previous release was
  largely untested.

* Initial release sctp-0.2.21

  With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
  version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.
  All `RPM' release numbers will be `-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)' and all
  `Debian' release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches
  and relelease the package, please bump up the release number and apply
  a suitable release suffix for your organization.  We leave `Debian'
  release number `_1' reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the
  source in the `.dsc' file.

  Improved build process.

  Not publicly released.

* Initial release sctp-0.2.20-1

  Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `sctp' release.

  The `OpenSS7 Linux Native SCTP' existed before as a kernel patch for
  the Linux kernel.  This is an `autoconf/rpm' packaging release of
  `Linux Native SCTP' that builds and installs separate from the Linux
  kernel tree.

  Not publicly released.
