The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 Linux Native SCTP package.

 Major changes for release sctp-0.2.24
--------------------------------------

This is primarily a maintenance release correcting reported bugs, but
also includes the latest packaging improvements.

   * Added `send-pr' scripts for automatic problem report generation.

   * Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   * Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   * Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   * Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   * Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   * Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   * Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   * Fixed problems with unresolved symbols on some systems.  Fixed
     glaring error in `sctp_init' preventing kernel module from loading.

   * Added init scripts and system control configuration data.  Removed
     old preload approach to kernel module loading.

 Major changes for release sctp-0.2.23
--------------------------------------

Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
compiler warnings.

Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
mailing list.

 Major changes for release sctp-0.2.22
--------------------------------------

This is primarily a bug fixes release and corrections resulting from
testing.  This is a major bug fix release.  The previous release was
largely untested.

 Major changes for release sctp-0.2.21
--------------------------------------

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
`RPM' release numbers will be `-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)' and all `Debian'
release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches and release
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable
release suffix for your organization.  We leave `Debian' release number
`_1' reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the
`.dsc' file.

Improved build process.

Not publicly released.

 Initial release sctp-0.2.20-1
------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `sctp' release.

The `OpenSS7 Linux Native SCTP' existed before as a kernel patch for the
Linux kernel.  This is an `autoconf/rpm' packaging release of `Linux
Native SCTP' that builds and installs separate from the Linux kernel
tree.

Not publicly released.
