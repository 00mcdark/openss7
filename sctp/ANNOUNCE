sctp 0.2.23 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

This is a release of the OpenSS7 Linux Native (Sockets) implementation
of SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol), previously only
available as a Kernel patch.  This package contains the necessary
manual pages, header files, and configures and installs against almost
any 2.4 kernel, even production kernels, without patching.

This release provides corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean
compile and test runs on x86_64 architecture.  It also provides some bug
corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler warnings, and corrects
build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on mailing list.

 This is a public alpha release of the package.

 Please see README-alpha in the release, or
 <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sctp-0.2.23/README-alpha>.
 
 This release deprecates previous releases as well as the older
 linux-sctp kernel patches.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the sctp package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/sctp_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sctp-0.2.23/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sctp-0.2.23/NEWS> in the release for
more information.  Also, see the sctp.pdf manual in the release (also
