Package sctp-0.2.24 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 Linux Native SCTP package is the OpenSS7 Linux Native
(Sockets) Kernel implementation of Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP).

sctp-0.2.24 is the 0.2.24 version of a Linux Kernel native
implementation of RFC 2960 Stream Control Transmission Protocol.  For
information on using the implementation see the man/sctp.7 Linux manual
page and look at the test programs in sctp-0.2.24/test/.

_Warning_: This is prerelease code.  It is Beta but rather stable.
Nevertheless, it is possible it will crash or lock your machine in some
situations.  Please remember that there is _NO WARRANTY_ with this code
and take appropriate precautions when attempting to run it.

This distribution is only currently applicable to Linux 2.4 kernels and
was targeted at ix86, x86_64, ppc and ppc64 architectures, but should
build and install for other architectures as well.

This is the twenty-fourth release of the Linux Native (Sockets) SCTP
from the OpenSS7 Project.  This release, as with other releases, on
builds and installs on 2.4 kernels.  This package is not as important to
the OpenSS7 Project as the STREAMS version of SCTP, which provides the
basis for all of the SIGTRAN components for the OpenSS7 stacks.  Also,
the STREAMS version runs on both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.

This is a stable production release: it deprecates previous releases.
Please upgrade to the current release before reporting bugs.

This is primarily a maintenance release correcting reported bugs, but
also includes the latest packaging improvements.

Following are highlights of some of the changes since the last release:

   - Support for (configure but not build on) most recent 2.6.18 kernels
     (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).

   - Added `send-pr' scripts for automatic problem report generation.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Added --disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - Fixed problems with unresolved symbols on some systems.  Fixed
     glaring error in sctp_init preventing kernel module from loading.

   - Added init scripts and system control configuration data.  Removed
     old preload approach to kernel module loading.


_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
sctp package page (http://www.openss7.org/sctp_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sctp-0.2.24/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sctp-0.2.24/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `sctp.pdf' manual in the release (also
