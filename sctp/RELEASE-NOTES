Release linux-sctp-0.2.14 (Prerelease2-14)

	Included ADD-IP and PR-SCTP and IG changes.

Release linux-sctp-0.2.13 (Prerelease2-13)

	Bug fixes.

Release linux-sctp-0.2.4: (Prerelease2-4)

	Upgraded MIB stats to draft-ietf-sigtran-sctp-mib-07.txt.

Release linux-sctp-0.2.3: (Prerelease2-3)

	Bug fixes.

Release linux-sctp-0.2.2: (Prerelease2-2)

	Bug fixes.

Release linux-sctp-0.2.1: (Prerelease2-1)

	Bug fixes.

Release linxu-sctp-0.2:  (Prerelease2)

    Here's what works well:

	The code handles socket semantics for SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET
	will and performs orderly establishment and teardown of associations
	correctly.  All of the socket semantics tested by the test program
	work correctly.  Multihoming and Nagle work correctly.  Multiple
	checksums and HMAC algorithms work correctly.  Gap reports, sacks,
	communication under noise, multihoming failover, all work well.
	TCP compatible sockets works well.

    Here's what down't work so well:

	Again, don't set CONFIG_SCTP_EXTENDED_IP_SUPPORT yet.  This is still a
	place-saver for extended Linux IP capabilities.  Don't turn it on.
	Partial copy and checksum improvements as well as hardware checksum
	support doesn't quite work yet.

Release linux-sctp-0.1:  (Prerelease1)

    This version was tested at the 3rd SCTP Bakeoff at ETSI in Sophia Antipolis.
    The test programs which were executed and some of the Ethereal dumps are
    provided under the linux-sctp-0.1/test/ directory.

    Here's what works well:

        The code handles socket semantics and the orderly establishment and
        teardown of associations correctly.

        All of the socket sematics tested by the test programs work correctly.

        Multihoming works correctly.

    Here's what doesn't work so well:

        Don't set CONFIG_SCTP_EXTENDED_IP_SUPPORT.  This is just a place-saver
        around some code which will eventually support IP proxying and firewalls
        and stuff.  It is guaranteed not to work just yet.

        In some situations, the padding of parameters on send or receive may
        be incorrect and cause the CHUNK to be rejected.

    Here's what needs to be done yet:

        Get CONFIG_SCTP_EXTENDED_IP_SUPPORT working for firewalls and proxies.

        Test SHA-1 and HMD5 cookie signing.  (Currently the cookie HMAC is just
        set to all 1's regardless of configuration settings).

        Clean up some of the sctp_abort processing (closing sockets under
        interrupt).

        Clean up some of the GAP and SACK handling on both the sending and
        receive side.

        Get CONFIG_SCTP_TCP_COMPATIBLE tested and working.

        Clean out a few bugs.
