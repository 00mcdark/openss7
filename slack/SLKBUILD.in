#	add it to the array like this: source=("thing.tar.gz" "foo.patch"
#	"bar.icon").  If you don't specify a url for a file, that file will be
#	copied inside the package, in a /usr/src/$pkgname-$pkgver directory.

# options - this is an array that allows you to control certain behaviours of
#	the build script that is generated.  The options it takes are:
#
#	'noextract' which prevents the script from automatically extracting
#	    tarballs, this is useful in dealing with tarbombs and some other
#	    instances.  If you use this, it is necessary to untar any tarballs
#	    yourself in build().
#
#	'nostrip' option prevents the exection of the stripping function, can be
#	    useful in some applications, that break if they are stripped.
#
#	'noautodotnew' is used to remove the automatic dotnew handling in all
#	    files in etc.
#
#	'tgz', 'tbz' and 'tlz' set the compression format for the resulting
#	    package, the default is txz.  If you set more than one 'tgz', 'tbz'
#	    and 'tlz', only the first one will be used.  whichever is that.
options=('nostrip')
# url - homepage or some other information url about the software
url="http://www.openss7.org/"
# dotnew - These are generally configuration files.  They will be renamed with a
#	.new extension and the appropriate addition will be made to the
#	doinst.sh to move them over if appropriate to do so during install.
dotnew=\
(
)
# CXXCFLAGS/CFLAGS - You can set these to override the default flags which are
#	"-O2 -march=$arch -mtune=i686" where $arch is the variable you set in
#	SLKBUILD.  Note that if you override it, you need to put all the flags.
#	Like if you just want to change -O2 to -O3, you would need to put
#	CFLAGS="-O3 -march=$arch -mtune=i686" not just CFLAGS="-O3".
CFLAGS="-O2"
CXXFLAGS="-O2"

# slackdesc - These are the lines for the slack-desc in the package.  Make sure
#	each line is under 70 characters, you can ensure that by following the
#	commented out ruler.  Use the general rules for this, the first line has
#	the name and a short description.  The lines under it have a longer
#	description.  Don't worry about skipping line 2, the slkbuild does that
#	automatically.  Put quotes around each line and make sure you don't have
#	more than ten lines.  All of these fules are checked by the script to
#	make sure that they are compilant so don't be too worried, it will tell
#	you.

# build() - This is the function that actually creates the package.  To
#	understand this, you need to know what the build script does before it
#	runs it.  The build script first assigns "pwd" to $startdir.  It then
#	creates $startdir/src.  It then copies everything in the source=() array
#	into $startdir/src and untars any tarballs.  After that it creates
#	$startdir/pkg.  You job in build() is to do whatever you need to do in
#	$startdir/src to get $startdir/pkg setup as a DESTDIR.  Remember that it
#	automatically untars tarballs, so here what happens is I change into the
#	untarred directory, compile and then install into $startdir/pkg.  Don't
#	worrry about gzipping and strippping and all of that stuff, it is
#	handled by the build script.  Also try to do "make || return 1" so that
#	the build script stops if the compile fails.
