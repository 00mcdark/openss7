Package strx25-0.9.2.1 was released under AGPLv3 2008-10-31.

OpenSS7 X.25 Networking (strx25) is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of
various X.25 networking components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.

This release is the first separate release of the OpenSS7 X.25
Networking package.  Some of the components in this package were
formerly present in the strss7 package.  Various networking drivers are
provided as well as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and XTI header files for X.25
operation.  The package contains the necessary manual pages and other
documentation for X.25 components in a separate autoconf tarball.

This release is a separate release of the OpenSS7 X.25 and Frame Relay
Stack package. Some of the components in this package were formerly
present in the strss7 and striso packages. Various networking drivers
are provided as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and XTI header files for X.25 and
Frame Relay operation. The package contains the necessary manual pakges
and other documentation for ISO/OSI X.25 and Frame Relay operation in an
autoconf tarball. This release is a pre-alpha release, and is an
optional part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (as of openss7-0.9.2.G).

This is the initial separate release from The OpenSS7 Project of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS X.25 and Frame Relay package. The package provides
components that were previously part of the striso package, as well as
providing significant new components for X.25 and Frame Relay operation.
This package contains all the necessary manual pages and other
documentation. The package is packaged as an OpenSS7 style autoconf
tarball.

This is the first pre-alpha release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is an
optional part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (as of openss7-0.9.2.G).

This release is the initial release of the package.

This is the initial public pre-alpha release of the package. Please see
README-alpha in the release or Maturity, in the manual.

This package is currently incomplete. It is being released as a
reference point for the community. See TODO in the release or Schedule
in the manual, for more information about the release schedule. If you
are interested in completion of this package, contact
<mailto:info@openss7.com>.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

  - Minor documentation corrections.
  - Kernel module license made explicit GPL v2. And then changed back
    to GPL.
  - License upgrade to AGPL Version 3.
  - Modifications to build under Fedora 2.6.22.5-49 kernel. These
    changes also support 2.6.22.9-91.fc7 kernel.
  - Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation
    primarily for embedded targets.
  - Improvements to common build process for embedded and
    cross-compile targets.
  - Modifications to build under Fedora 2.6.25-45.fc9 and
    2.6.26.5-45.fc9 kernels.
  - Updated tool chain to m4-1.4.12, autoconf-2.63 and texinfo-4.13.
  - Conversion of RPM spec files to common approach for major
    subpackages.
  - Updated references database for manual pages and roff(1)
    documents.
  - Build system now builds yum(8) repositories for RPMs and
    apt-get(8) repositories for DEBs. Installation documentation has
    been updated to include details of repository install sourcesref.
  - Added MODULE_VERSION to all modules and drivers.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and
2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the GNU Affero General Public
License (AGPL) Version 3.  The release is available as an autoconf
tarball, SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs. See the downloads
page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for the autoconf tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs, and binary RPMs and DEBs,
