 Abstract
=========

This manual provides a `X.25 Porting Guide' for `OpenSS7 X.25 Networking'.

 Objective
----------

The objective of this manual is to provide a porting guide for the "STREAMS"
and "X.25" programmer when porting "STREAMS" drivers, modules and applications
to `OpenSS7 X.25 Networking' from other major implementations of "X.25", such
as `AIX', `AIXlink/X.25', `Digital UNIX', `HP-UX', `IRIX', `OSF', `PowerMAX',
`Solaris', `Solstice X.25', `SVR4.2', `Tru64 UNIX', `UnixWare', and others.

This guide provides information to developers on the use of the "X.25"
interfaces and drivers at the user and kernel levels as well as the difference
between the OpenSS7 implementation of X.25 drivers and those of these other
systems.

 Intent
-------

The intent of this manual is to act as a guide to porting "X.25" "STREAMS"
modules, drivers and applications programs from other "UNIX" implementations of
"X.25" to `Linux Fast-STREAMS'(1).  It is intended to be read alone and is not
intended to replace or supplement the `OpenSS7 X.25 Networking' manual pages.
For a reference for writing code, the manual pages (see `x25(7)' (*note
(*manpages*)x25(7)::)) provide a better reference to the programmer.  Although
this describes the features of the `OpenSS7 X.25 Networking' package, OpenSS7
Corporation (http://www.openss7.com/) is under no obligation to provide any
software, system or features listed herein.

 Audience
---------

This manual is intended for a highly technical audience.  The reader should
already be familiar with `Linux' kernel and user application programming, the
`Linux' file system, character devices, driver input and output, interrupts,
software interrupt handling, scheduling, process contexts, multiprocessor
locks, thread programming, POSIX porgramming, etc.

This guide is intended for network and systems programmers, who use the
"STREAMS" and "X.25" mechanism at user and kernel levels for `Linux' and `UNIX'
system communications services.  Readers of the guide are expected to possess
prior knowledge of the `Linux' and `UNIX' system, programming, networking, and
data communication.

To derive maximum use from this porting guide, it is intended that the reader
also be familiar with the user of "STREAMS" and "X.25" under `UNIX' and `POSIX'
systems implementing "X.25" drivers and applications libraries.  The reader
should certainly be familiar with the "X.25" implementations on the `UNIX' or
`POSIX' system from which "STREAMS" drivers, modules or applications are being
ported.

2 Porting
*********

* Menu:

* Porting Organization::

This guide is largely focused on porting "STREAMS" drivers, modules and
applications programs that act in the capacity of an X.25 User.  Whereas other
documents tend to focus on simply porting drivers for specific interface cards,
that topic is adequately addressed elsewhere for the `Linux' kernel.  Whenever
a network device driver has been written for a device under `Linux', using
`Linux' paradigms and procedures, it can automatically work with "X.25".
Therefore, this guide focusses on the differences between the "X.25" interfaces
that would be experienced by the X.25 User: "STREAMS" modules that push over
X.25 Streams; "STREAMS" drivers under which X.25 Streams are linked; and
applications programs that access the X.25 interface directly as a user-space
program.

`Linux Fast-STREAMS' and each of its add-on packages, including `OpenSS7 X.25
Networking', ship with a wide assortment of manual pages.  Most manual pages
contain a section entitled "`COMPATIBILITY'" that provides compatibility and
porting information for various mainstream `UNIX' implementations.  For
information on the minor differences in the "STREAMS" environment, see the
`Linux Fast-STREAMS' package, `streams-0.9.2.4'.

There are hundreds of manual pages in the `OpenSS7 X.25 Networking' package for
"X.25".  These manual pages can be explored best by starting with the `x25(7)'
(*note (*manpages*)x25(7)::) manual page.  The manual pages document both X.25
Revision 2.0.0 standard behaviour, as well as the `OpenSS7 X.25 Networking'
implementations of extension primitives, input-output controls, and features
documented for other operating systems including `AIX', `HP-UX', `IRIX', `OSF',
`PowerMAX', `Solaris', `SVR 4', `SVR 4.2MP', `UnixWare 7'.  Although each of
the "X.25" related manual pages of supported functions, primitives and
structures provide compatibilty and porting information, this document attempts
to gather together pertinent information concerning porting "X.25" modules,
drivers and applications programs from various "UNIX" operating systems
supporting "STREAMS" and "X.25" to `OpenSS7 X.25 Networking'.

Where there is discrepencies between this documentation and the manual pages
that ship with the package, the manual pages are controlling.  This is because
this guide is updated less frequently that the documented functionality in the
manual pages.

2.1 Porting Organization
========================

The porting information in this guide is organized by the flavor of operating
system from which porting is being attempted.  Note that, aside from
configuration details, any system not listed here that is based on `SVR 4',
`SVR 4.2MP', or on another of the implementations, should start with that
implementation's portability information.  Porting information is included for
porting from implementations based on a strict interpretation of the "X.25"
standards, the `AIX' operating system and the `AIXlink/X.25' package, the
`HP-UX' operating system, the `IRIX' operating system, the the `OSF', `Digital
UNIX', or `Tru64 UNIX' operating system, the `PowerMAX' operating system, the
`Solaris' operating system and the `Solstice X.25' or `SunLink X.25' packages,
the `SVR 4' and `SVR 4.2MP' operating system, and the `UnixWare 7' operating
system.

Note that additional porting information with regard to porting "X.25"
applications from various implementations to `Linux Fast-STREAMS' is detailed
in the `X.25 Porting Guide' which is part of the `OpenSS7 X.25' package
(`strx25').

Porting information is organized into sections as follows:

3 General Porting Considerations
********************************

3.1 Interfaces
==============

There are four (4) "STREAMS" service primitive interfaces normally provided by
the X.25 implementations.  These are:

`Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)'
     The Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) is an UNIX International standard
     interface maintained by the OpenGroup that is in Revision 2.0.0 with
     corrigenda.  For X.25, DLPI normallly provide direct access to the X.25
     LAPB protocol or ISO/IEC 8802 LAPB.

     It is specified by "`Open Group CAE Specification: Data Link Provider
     Interface (DLPI) Sepcification, Revision 2.0.0, Draft 2, August 20, 1991,
     (Parsippany, New Jersey), UNIX International, Inc., UNIX International
     Press.'," available from The OpenSS7 Project
     (http://www.openss7.org/docs/dlpi.pdf).(1)

`Network Layer Interface (NLI)'
     The Network Layer Interface (NLI) is an non-standard interface developed by
     Spider, that provides access to the remnants of their X.25, XOL, XOT
     implemetnations.  This interface is prevelant in `Solaris', `HP-UX',
     `IRIX', and other systems.

`Network Provider Interface (NPI)'
     The Network Provider Interface (NPI) is a UNIX International standard
     interface maintained by the OpenGroup that is in Revision 2.0.0 with
     corrigenda.  For X.25, NPI normally provides OSI CONS over X.25, but some
     implementations use it for direct access to X.25 (`AIX' does this).

     It is specified by "`Open Group CAE Specification: Network Provider
     Interface (NPI) Specification, Revision 2.0.0, Draft 2, August 17, 1992,
     (Parsippany, New Jersey), UNIX International, Inc., UNIX International
     Press.'," available from The OpenSS7 Project
     (http://www.openss7.org/docs/npi.pdf).(2)

`X/Open X.25 Interface (XX25)'
     The X/Open X.25 Interface (XX25) is an standard interface developed by
     X/Open and maintained by the OpenGroup.

     It is specified by "`Open Group CAE Specification: X.25 Programming
     Interface using XTI (XX25), Document No: C411, November 1995, (Berkshire,
     UK), X/Open, Open Group Publication. [ISBN: 1-85912-136-5]'" available from
     The Open Group (http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/).


3.2 Aspects
===========

There are several aspects of porting from the various environments to `Linux
Fast-STREAMS' that can be categorized roughly by the functional interface to
which the aspect corresponds.  These aspects are:

   * `Addressing' - The Addressing aspect is the aspect of associating an
     address with the local endpoint and addresses associated with remote
     endpoints.

   * `Modes' - The Modes aspect is the aspect of major operating modes of
     enpoints.

   * `Primitives' - The Primitives aspect is the aspect of implementing service
     primitives accross the service primitive interface.

   * `Input-Output Controls' - The Input-Output control aspec is the aspect of
     providing impelementation-specific input-output control for the control of
     major aspect modes, replacement for primtives, or management and
     administration of the interface.

   * `Drivers and Modules' - The Drivers and Modules aspect is the naming,
     enumeration, and linkage of driver and modules into protocol stacks.

   * `Libraries and Utilities' - The Libraries and Utilities aspect is the
     aspect of C-language programs and shared object libraries the provide
     access to the interfaces or permit in the control of modes, protocol
     actions, management and adminstration, or protocl stakc construction and
     maintenance.

   * `Management' - The Management aspect is, of course, the aspect of
     management of the interface and protocol stack implemetnation using
     standard SNMP MIBs or CMIP GDMOs.


The aspects can be applied to each of four (4) interfaces offered to X.25 LAPB
and PLP users, described under *note Interfaces::.

The sections that following provide an overview of each of these aspects.  Also,
each specific porting section has sub-sections that detail each of these aspects
of a specific porting scenario.

4 Porting from AIX
******************

This section provides an overview of porting from the `AIX' environment, and in
particular from the `AIXlink/X.25' package.  Most of the information concerning
the `AIXlink/X.25' implementation of X.25 is contained in the IBM document:
"`AIXlink/X.25 Vesion 2.1 for AIX: Guide and Reference, No: SC23-2520-07, Eigth
Edition, September 2006, (Bolder, CO), International Business Machines Corp.,

====================================

The specific Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) is described in the
AIXlink/X.25 documentation.(1)

Note that `AIXlink/X.25' only documents the ability to use the DLPI interface
for specific LAPB links for which the link is specified as DLPI and does not
provide X.25 packet layer support for such data links.

4.2 AIX Network Layer Interface
===============================

`AIX' does not document a `Network Layer Interface (NLI)'.  It only documents a
`Network Provider Interface (NPI)' in support of X.25 applications.
Nevertheless, it appears that the NPI provided by `AIXlink/X.25' is merely an
"`npi'" module pushed over an NLI Stream opened on an X.25 packet layer
protocol driver.  So, although it is not documented, it appears that the X.25
packet layer protocol driver provided by `AIXlink/X.25' is indeed a Spider NLI
driver.

`OpenSS7 X.25 Networking', on the other hand, provides both NLI and NPI
interface for X.25 drivers, modules and applications.

4.3.1 AIX NPI Addressing
------------------------

4.3.1.1 AIX NPI Driver Naming
.............................

For an application to use NPI, it would typically follow these steps:

  1. Open a Stream to the packet driver.

  2. Pushe the NPI module.

  3. Bind the application to the NPI module.

  4. Submit a connection request to establish a connection between the local
     and remote X.25 systems.

  5. Once the connection becomes established, transfer the required data.

  6. Disconnect the two systems.

The example `AIXlink/X.25' gives is:

     dev = open("/dev/x25pkt", O_RDWR);
     /* assumes good return value */
     ioctl(dev, I_PUSH, "npi"); /* uses the streams library push ioctl */

 GNU Affero General Public License
==================================



                    The GNU Affero General Public License.
                          Version 3, 19 November 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble
---------

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the
community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, our General
Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program-to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made
in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become
available for other developers to incorporate.  Many developers of free
software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However,
in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come
about.  The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code
to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that,
in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.  It
requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the
modified version running there to the users of that server.  Therefore, public
use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public
access to the source code of the modified version.

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by
Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is a different license,
not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the
Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

                             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
     works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
     a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
     exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
     earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
     the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
     under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
     modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution
     (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
     some countries other activities as well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a
     computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
     extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
     (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
     there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
     are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and
     how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of
     user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
     meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of a
     work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
     standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
     interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
     widely used among developers working in that language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than
     the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging
     a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
     serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
     implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to
     the public in source code form.  A "Major Component", in this context,
     means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
     the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs,
     or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
     to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
     source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
     the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
     activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
     general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
     unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the
     work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition
     files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
     shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
     or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
     covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
     content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
     rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
     without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
     You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them
     make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for
     running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this
     License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
     Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
     exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms
     that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material
     outside their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
     conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
     unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
     under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the
     WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
     prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
     is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
     covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
     modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
     users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
     technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
     it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
     publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all
     notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in
     accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the
     absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License
     along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
     you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of
     section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
          and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
          under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
          requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
          notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
          anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
          therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
          to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
          are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
          any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
          separately received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
          interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
          need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
     which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which
     are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a
     volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if
     the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the
     access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
     individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does
     not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
     sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
     Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
          used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
          offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
          offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
          anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
          Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
          covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
          for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
          cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
          offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
          allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
          received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
          6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
          (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
          Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
          further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
          Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
          the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
          on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
          equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
          next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
          obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
          satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
          inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
          the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
          subsection 6d.


     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
     the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
     conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
     tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
     household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
     into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
     doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
     product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical
     or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
     particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
     or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer
     product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
     significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
     and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
     a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
     suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
     code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
     modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
     specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part
     of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
     Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
     (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
     Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
     Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any
     third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
     User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
     requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
     for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
     the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
     network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
     adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
     protocols for communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
     accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
     (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
     and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
     copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
     License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
     Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
     treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that
     they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only
     to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
     permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License
     without regard to the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
     any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
     (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in
     certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional
     permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you
     have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add
     to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
     material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
          of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
          attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
          displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
          requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
          reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
          authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
          names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
          anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
          contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
          liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
          licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
     received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
     governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
     you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further
     restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
     may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
     document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
     relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
     place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
     that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
     applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form
     of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
     requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
     it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph
     of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
     from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
     and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
     license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
     of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
     cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
     permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
     reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
     violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
     you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
     licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
     License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
     reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
     material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
     copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
     solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
     copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than
     this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
     work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
     a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
     work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing
     compliance by third parties with this License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work
     results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
     receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
     the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
     paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
     work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can
     get it with reasonable efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
     granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a
     license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
     this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
     or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed
     by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or
     any portion of it.

 11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work
     thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
     controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
     acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
     License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not
     include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
     modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition,
     "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
     patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
     use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
     the contents of its contributor version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
     agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
     (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue
     for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a party
     means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent
     against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
     the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
     free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
     available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must
     either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)
     arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
     particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the
     requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but
     for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
     your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one
     or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to
     believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
     you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
     grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
     authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of
     the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically
     extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the
     scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
     non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted
     under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party
     to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
     distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party
     based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under
     which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the
     covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
     with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
     copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
     compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
     arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
     implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
     available to you under applicable patent law.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
     covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
     not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate
     you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
     convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and
     this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
     Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting
     with it remotely through a network (if your version supports such
     interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your
     version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network
     server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of
     facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source shall include
     the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU
     General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following
     paragraph.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
     link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of
     the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
     the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to
     the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined
     will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
     the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
     in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
     specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public
     License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
     following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
     any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public
     License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
     Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
     the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
     statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose
     that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
     However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
     holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
     THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
     IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
     ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
     ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
     PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
     GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
     USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
     EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
     SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
     cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
     courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
     waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
     warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
     return for a fee.


                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
----------------------------------------------

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Affero General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a network, you should
also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.  For
example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a
"Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code.  There are many ways
you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different
programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
`http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

 GNU General Public License
===========================



                          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                            Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble
---------

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program-to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most
of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors'
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to
change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area
of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

                             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
     works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
     a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
     exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
     earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
     the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
     under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
     modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution
     (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
     some countries other activities as well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a
     computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
     extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
     (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
     there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
     are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and
     how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of
     user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
     meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of a
     work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
     standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
     interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
     widely used among developers working in that language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than
     the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging
     a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
     serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
     implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to
     the public in source code form.  A "Major Component", in this context,
     means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
     the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs,
     or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
     to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
     source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
     the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
     activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
     general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
     unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the
     work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition
     files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
     shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
     or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
     covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
     content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
     rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
     without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
     You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them
     make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for
     running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this
     License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
     Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
     exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms
     that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material
     outside their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
     conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
     unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
     under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the
     WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
     prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
     is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
     covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
     modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
     users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
     technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
     it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
     publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all
     notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in
     accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the
     absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License
     along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
     you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of
     section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
          and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
          under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
          requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
          notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
          anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
          therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
          to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
          are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
          any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
          separately received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
          interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
          need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
     which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which
     are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a
     volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if
     the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the
     access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
     individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does
     not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
     sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
     Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
          used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
          offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
          offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
          anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
          Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
          covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
          for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
          cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
          offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
          allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
          received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
          6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
          (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
          Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
          further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
          Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
          the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
          on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
          equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
          next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
          obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
          satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
          inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
          the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
          subsection 6d.


     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
     the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
     conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
     tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
     household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
     into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
     doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
     product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical
     or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
     particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
     or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer
     product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
     significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
     and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
     a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
     suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
     code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
     modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
     specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part
     of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
     Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
     (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
     Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
     Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any
     third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
     User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
     requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
     for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
     the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
     network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
     adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
     protocols for communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
     accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
     (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
     and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
     copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
     License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
     Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
     treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that
     they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only
     to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
     permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License
     without regard to the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
     any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
     (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in
     certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional
     permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you
     have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add
     to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
     material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
          of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
          attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
          displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
          requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
          reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
          authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
          names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
          anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
          contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
          liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
          licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
     received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
     governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
     you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further
     restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
     may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
     document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
     relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
     place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
     that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
     applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form
     of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
     requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
     it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph
     of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
     from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
     and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
     license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
     of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
     cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
     permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
     reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
     violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
     you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
     licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
     License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
     reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
     material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
     copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
     solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
     copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than
     this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
     work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
     a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
     work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing
     compliance by third parties with this License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work
     results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
     receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
     the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
     paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
     work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can
     get it with reasonable efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
     granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a
     license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
     this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
     or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed
     by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or
     any portion of it.

 11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work
     thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
     controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
     acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
     License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not
     include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
     modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition,
     "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
     patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
     use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
     the contents of its contributor version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
     agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
     (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue
     for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a party
     means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent
     against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
     the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
     free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
     available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must
     either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)
     arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
     particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the
     requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but
     for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
     your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one
     or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to
     believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
     you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
     grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
     authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of
     the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically
     extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the
     scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
     non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted
     under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party
     to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
     distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party
     based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under
     which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the
     covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
     with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
     copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
     compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
     arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
     implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
     available to you under applicable patent law.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
     covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
     not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate
     you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
     convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and
     this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
     to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3
     of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and
     to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to
     apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements
     of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning
     interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
     the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
     specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
     License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
     following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
     any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
     License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
     Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
     the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement
     of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
     version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
     However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
     holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
     THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
     IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
     ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
     ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
     PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
     GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
     USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
     EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
     SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
     cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
     courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
     waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
     warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
     return for a fee.


                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
----------------------------------------------

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might
be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
`http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead of this License.  But first, please read

 GNU Lesser General Public License
==================================



                       GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                            Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by
the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

     As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
     General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
     General Public License.

     "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
     than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

     An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by
     the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.  Defining a
     subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an
     interface provided by the Library.

     A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
     Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with
     which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

     The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
     Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
     portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on
     the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

     The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
     code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and
     utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
     Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

     You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
     without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

     If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
     facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
     that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

       a. under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
          ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function
          or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
          its purpose remains meaningful, or

       b. under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
          License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

     The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
     header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code
     under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is
     not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,
     or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in
     length), you do both of the following:

       a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
          Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
          this License.

       b. Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
          document.

  4. Combined Works.

     You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
     together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
     Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
     debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

       a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
          Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
          this License.

       b. Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
          license document.

       c. For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
          include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as
          well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL
          and this license document.

       d. Do one of the following:

            0. Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
               License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
               suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
               or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked
               Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner
               specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
               Corresponding Source.

            1. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
               Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
               a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
               system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of
               the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

       e. Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
          required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL,
          and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install
          and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
          recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of
          the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
          Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
          Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
          provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
          section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

     You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side
     by side in a single library together with other library facilities that
     are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such
     a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the
     following:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
          the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed
          under the terms of this License.

       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
          work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
          accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
     the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
     will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
     to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as
     you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
     published version or of any later version published by the Free Software
     Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
     number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any
     version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the
     Free Software Foundation.

     If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
     whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
     apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
     permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.


                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 GNU Free Documentation License
===============================



                        GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE
                          Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
     everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this
     License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
     their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made
     by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
     the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It complements
     the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for
     free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
     software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
     should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
     does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
     for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
     published as a printed book.  We recommend this License principally for
     works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
     contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
     distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
     world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
     under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below, refers to any
     such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
     addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you copy, modify or
     distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
     and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
     Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
     authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
     matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
     subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
     Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The relationship
     could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with
     related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or
     political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
     designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
     that the Document is released under this License.  If a section does not
     fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
     designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero Invariant
     Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
     there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
     Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
     Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may be at
     most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
     public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
     generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
     programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
     is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
     variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in
     an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup,
     has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if used
     for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is
     called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
     without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
     using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
     PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
     transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
     include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
     proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
     processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
     HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
     purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
     such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
     License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats which
     do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
     most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of
     the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
     either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
     translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific
     section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
     "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title" of such a section
     when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled
     XYZ" according to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
     states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
     Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
     but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
     these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
     meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
     notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
     Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
     conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use technical
     measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
     copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in
     exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies
     you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
     may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
     printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
     Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
     copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
     Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
     cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
     publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
     with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
     other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to
     the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
     these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
     you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
     actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
     than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
     along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
     computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
     access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
     Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
     distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
     copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
     Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
     them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
     conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
     Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
     filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
     modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
     In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
          from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
          should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
          Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if the
          original publisher of that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
          responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
          Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
          Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
          unless they release you from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
          Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
          to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
          giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
          terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
          and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
          to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
          publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
          there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
          stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
          given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
          Version as stated in the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
          public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
          network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
          based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You may
          omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
          years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
          version it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
          substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
          dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
          their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent
          are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not
          be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or
          to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
     that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
     Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
     as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
     Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be
     distinct from any other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
     example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
     an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
     passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
     Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
     and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
     by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text for the
     same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
     entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
     that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
     permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
     endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
     License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
     provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
     of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
     Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that
     you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
     identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.  If there
     are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
     make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
     parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
     if known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
     section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
     the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in
     the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
     likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any
     sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections Entitled
     "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
     released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
     License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
     the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
     verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
     it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
     License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
     respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
     independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
     distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting
     from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  When the
     Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
     other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of
     the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
     of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
     aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
     the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
     if the Document is in electronic form.  Otherwise they must appear on
     printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
     translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing
     Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
     their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
     Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
     Sections.  You may include a translation of this License, and all the
     license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
     that you also include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
     License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
     Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
     expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to copy,
     modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
     automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
     who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
     compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
     Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
     similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.  See `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.  If
     the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
     "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
     version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
     Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version number of this
     License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
=====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace
the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination
of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free
software.
