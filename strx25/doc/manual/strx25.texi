@cindex manual notice
@cindex licensing

This package is released and distributed under the @cite{AGPL} (@pxrefman{GNU Affero General Public
License}).  Please note, however, that there are different licensing terms for the manual pages and
some of the documentation (derived from OpenGroup@footnote{Formerly X/Open and UNIX International.}
publications and other sources).  Consult the permission notices contained in the documentation for
more information.

This manual is released under the @cite{FDL} (@pxrefman{GNU Free Documentation License}) with no
sections invariant.

@node Abstract
@unnumberedsec Abstract
@cindex manual abstract

This manual provides a @cite{@value{MANUAL_TYPE}} for @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.

@unnumberedsubsec Objective
@cindex manual objective

The objective of this manual is to provide a guide for the @dfn{STREAMS} programmer when
developing @dfn{STREAMS} modules, drivers and application programs for @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.

This guide provides information to developers on the use of the @dfn{STREAMS} mechanism at user and
kernel levels.

@dfn{STREAMS} was incorporated in UNIX System V Release 3 to augment the character input/output
(I/O) mechanism and to support development of communication services.

@dfn{STREAMS} provides developers with integral functions, a set of utility routines, and facilities
that expedite software design and implementation.

@unnumberedsubsec Intent
@cindex manual intent

The intent of this manual is to act as an introductory guide to the @dfn{STREAMS} programmer.  It
is intended to be read alone and is not intended to replace or supplement the
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} manual pages.  For a reference for writing code, the manual pages
(see @manref{STREAMS(9)}) provide a better reference to the programmer.
Although this describes the features of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package,
@uref{http://www.openss7.com/,OpenSS7 Corporation} is under no obligation to provide any software,
system or feature listed herein.

@unnumberedsubsec Audience
@cindex manual audience

This manual is intended for a highly technical audience.  The reader should already be familiar
with @cite{Linux} kernel programming, the @cite{Linux} file system, character devices, driver input
and output, interrupts, software interrupt handling, scheduling, process contexts, multiprocessor
locks, etc.

The guide is intended for network and systems programmers, who use the @dfn{STREAMS} mechanism at
user and kernel levels for @cite{Linux} and @cite{UNIX} system communication services.

Readers of the guide are expected to possess prior knowledge of the @cite{Linux} and @cite{UNIX}
system, programming, networking, and data communication.

System V Init Script for the @dfn{X25} Subsystem.
The @manpage{@value{PACKAGE}(8)} init script provides the ability to initialize, configure and mount the
@dfn{X25} subsystem, @manpage{strxnet(5)}.
The @manpage{@value{PACKAGE}(8)} script provides the RedHat-style init script, whereas the
@manpage{@value{PACKAGE}.sh(8)} script provides the Debian-style init script.

See @manref{@value{PACKAGE}(8)} for more information.

@end table

@subsection Administrative Utilities

Following are user utilities for manipulating @dfn{INET}:

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package
builds and installs the following utilities:

@table @command

@item @value{PACKAGE}_mknod
This is a C-language program that can be used by startup scripts to create device nodes for the
@samp{@value{PACKAGE}} package.  This utility is normally installed in the @file{/usr/sbin}
directory.
See @manref{@value{PACKAGE}_mknod(8)} for more information.

@item @value{PACKAGE}
This is a @cite{RedHat}-style System V init script that is installed and used to start and stop the
@samp{@value{PACKAGE}} package.  Starting consists of creating X.25 device nodes using
@command{@value{PACKAGE}_mknod} and installing the @file{streams-sctp} and
@file{streams-tpiperf} modules in the running kernel.  This init script is normally installed in the
@file{/etc/init.d} directory.

@item @value{PACKAGE}.sh
This is a @cite{Debian}-style System V init script that is installed and used to start and stop the
@samp{@value{PACKAGE}} package in a similar fashion to the @command{@value{PACKAGE}}
script, but in the @cite{Debian} style.  This init script is normally installed in the
@file{/etc/rc.d/init.d} directory.

@chapter Development
@cindex developing

@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} provides all of the header files, shared object and static libraries,
manual pages and documentation necessary for the development of both user space applications
programs and kernel space @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers based on the package.  The sections that
follow describe these development facilities.

@menu

* Kernel Module Development::
* Manual Pages::
@end menu

@node Development Header Files::
@section Header Files

Header files are installed, typically, in the @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}/} subdirectory.  To
use the header files from the package, @samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} must be included in the
@command{gcc} command line as a preprocessor option.

In general, @samp{-I} include preprocessor directives on the @command{gcc} command line should be
ordered in the reverse order of the dependencies between packages.  So, for example, if the include
files from all add-on packages are required, the order of these directives would be:
@samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strxns}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strcompat}
@samp{-I/usr/include/streams}.

Following are the user visible header files provided by the @file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}}
package in the directory @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}:

Typical include files for interacting with Transport providers from user space include the
@file{xti.h} header file.  Additional header files for interacting with specific drivers or modules
may also be required.  The @cite{xti.h} header file is for interacting with the XTI library.

@subsection Kernel Space Drivers and Modules

Typical include files for writing @dfn{STREAMS} module and drivers implementing transport providers
in kernels space include @cite{xti.h} and @cite{xti_sctp.h}.  The header files provide access to
definitions for the TPI interface and additional XTI definitions for use by @dfn{STREAMS} drivers
and modules.  Additional header files for interacting with specific drivers or modules may also be
required.

Aside from including this header files, the general procedures for compiling @dfn{STREAMS} modules
and drivers also apply to @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers written to the Transport Provider
Interface.

@node Static and Shared Libraries
@section Libraries

Shared or static version of the @cite{libxnet} library may be linked when using the
@file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package.@footnote{Note that the @file{libxnet} library is
now provided by the @file{strxnet-@value{VERSION_STRXNET}} package.} The library may either be
specified on the @command{gcc} command line as a shared library (e.g. @samp{-lxnet}) or as a static
library (e.g.  @samp{/usr/lib/libxnet.a}).

If the shared object library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command
line:

@table @samp

@item -lxnet
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libxnet.so} shared library.

@end table

If the static library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command line:

@table @samp

@item /usr/lib/libxnet.a
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libxnet.a} static library.

@end table

@node Kernel Module Development
@section Kernel Modules

Developing TPI kernel modules is similar to user space programs with regard to header files.
@file{/usr/include/strxnet} should be placed as an include directory to search on the @command{gcc}
command line.  The rules for compiling @cite{Linux} kernel modules and the rules for compiling
@dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers should be followed.  In particular, several important intricacies
should be considered:

@itemize @bullet

@item The @command{gcc} compiler used to compile the kernel modules must be the same version of
compiler that was used to compile the kernel and @dfn{STREAMS} base package.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must have the same compile flags that were used to compile the
kernel and @dfn{STREAMS} base package.  @command{kbuild} can be used to accomplish this.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must define several important kernel defines including
@samp{-DLINUX}, @samp{-D__KERNEL__}, as well as the base name of the module.  Again, @command{kbuild}
can be used to accomplish this.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must include several important files directly on the command
line, such as, @samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-autoconf.h} and
@samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-modversions.h}.@footnote{The
kernel version, @samp{@value{_kversion}}, is just an example.  For the running kernel, use the
output of @samp{uname -r}.}

@node Conformance
@chapter Conformance
@cindex conformance

Although @cite{OpenSS7 Project} software is of high quality, and untested behaviour is often correct
behaviour, the principle of the @cite{OpenSS7 Project} is to test all functional requirements
against the behaviour of the package in a repeatable validation test suite that can be used to
perform regression, target architecture validation and trouble shooting, (@pxrefman{Maturity}, and
@pxrefman{Test Suites}).
