.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ifrtune
is a configuration command intended on being executed from system configuration
scripts, and, in particular, the
.BR ifrnetd (8)
configuration daemon.  Its purpose is to alter or interrogate the tunable
parameters of an Frame Relay
.[
q922
.]
subnetwork connection.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The
.B ifrtune
command accepts the following options:
.\"
.SS Command Options
The following command options are mutually exclusive (except for \fB-h\fP,
\fB-V\fP and \fB-C\fP which never cause an error when specified with another
command topion).  If no command option is given, \fB-G\fP is assumed.
.TP
\fB-G\fP, \fB--get\fP
Retrieve configuration information for the specified \fIsubnet\fP, from the
default or specified \fIdevice\fP, and write the output to \fIstdout\fP (or
\fIfilename\fP, when given).  This option can be used to create a properly
frmatted configuration file from an existing system configuration.
.TP
\fB-P\fP, \fB--put\fP
Load configuration information for the specified \fIsubnet\fP, to the default or
specified \fIdevice\fP, getting the confirmation input from \fIstdin\fP (or
\fIfilename\fP, when given).  This option can be use to tune current system
configuration.
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
When this option is encountered, usage information is printed to \fIstdout\fP,
option processing stops, and the program exits successfully without taking any
further action.
.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
When this option is encountered, version information is printed to \fIstdout\fP,
option processing stops, and the program exits successfully without taking any
further action.
.TP
\fB-C\fP, \fB--copying\fP
When this option is encountered, copyring permissions is printed to
\fIstdout\fP, option processing stops, and the program exits successfully
without taking any further action.
.\"
.SS Non-Command Option
The following non-command options can be combined together and with any command
option.  Non-command options that are not necessary for the specified command
option do not generate an error by mere combination.
.TP
\fB-e\fP, \fB--extended\fP
Normally \fBifrtune\fP processes a fixed number of lines from \fIstdin\fP (or
\fIfilename\fP) when sepcified, and outputs a fixed number of lines to
\fIstdout\fP (or \fIfilename\fP) when specified.  This fixed number of lines are
strictly compatible with other implementations of \fBifrtune\fP.
.RS
.PP
When the \fB-e\fP option is specified, additional lines are accepted on input
and are generated on output.  For the format of the fixed lines and the
additional lines, see
.BR ifrtemplate (5).
.RE
.TP
\fB-s\fP, \fB--subnet\fP \fIsubnet\fP
Specifies the subnetwork identifier, \fIsubnet\fP, to which the tuning operation
applies.  \fIsubnet\fP is normally an alphabetical character starting at
\*(lq\fBA\fP\*(rq for the first subnetwork, \*(lq\fBB\fP\*(rq for the second
subnetwork, and so on.  This option must always be given when the \fB-P\fP or
\fB-G\fP options are present or assumed.
.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--device\fP \fIdevice\fP
Specifies the device to open when tuning.  When unspecified, the device is
\fB/dev/ifr\fP.  See also \*(lq\fIDEVICES\fP,\*(rq below.
.TP
\fB-n\fP, \fB--dryrun\fP
Execute the command (\fB-P\fP or \fB-G\fP) as a dry run.  When this option is
specified with the \fB-P\fP option, the input is read and checked for validity,
but the configuration is not written to the device.  When specified with the
\fB-G\fP option, information is read from the device, but configuration
information is not output.  The exit status and diagnostic output of the command
still reflects the success or failure of the command.
.TP
\fB-q\fP, \fB--quiet\fP
Suppresses normal output.  This is the same as \fB--verbose\fP=\fB0\fP.
.TP
\fB-D\fP, \fB--debug\fP [\fIlevel\fP]
Increase or specify the debug verbosity \fIlevel\fP.  The default debug
\fIlevel\fP is zero (0).  This option may be repeated.  Level zero (0)
corresponds to no debugging output.
.TP
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP [\fIlevel\fP]
Increase or specify the output verbosity \fIlevel\fP.  The default output
\fIlevel\fP is one (1).  This option may be repeated.  Level zero (0)
corresponds to no normal output.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
The following non-option arguments may be provided on the comman line:
.TP
.I filename
Specifies the \fIfilename\fP from which to read (\fB-P\fP option) or write
(\fB-G\fP option) configuraiton information.
.RS
.PP
This argument is optiona.  When the \fIfilename\fP is not given and the \fB-P\fP
option is specified, the values are read from \fIstdin\fP; for the \fB-G\fP
option, written to \fIstdout\fP.
.PP
If the \fIfilename\fP is an absolute path (i.e. begins with \*(lq\fB/\fP\*(rq),
then \fIfilename\fP is assumed to be the next path specified.  Otherwise, the
file required is assumed to be
\fB@configdir@/@PACKAGE@/template/\fP\fIfilename\fP.  See
.BR ifrtemplate (5)
for the format of the file.
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1)
indicates that an error occured and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option or argument syntax was in error and a
diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
option suppresses the printing of normal output to
.I stdout
and diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .

whitespace (any number of blanks, horizontal tabs, new lines, carriage returns,
vertical tabs, form feeds).

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B ifrtune
command is compatible with
.IR "Spider Frame Relay" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "Spider Frame Relay" ,
such as
.IR "AIXlink/X.25" ,
.[

.IR "HP-UX" ,

.IR "PT X.25" ,

.IR "SBE X.25" ,

with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
A version of this command is provided by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
for compatibility with systems that require it.  Neither this command nor the
.BR x25netd (8)
are recommended for configuration of the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
subsystems.  Use the SNMP agent instead.
.IP \(em
Options
.BR -e ", " -n ", " -q ", " -v ", " -h ", " -V ", " -C ,
and all long options, are specific to this
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation of
.BR ifrtune
and will not be used by portable command scripts.
.IP \(em
No other implementation documents printing the output to a file when a
.I filename
is specified with the
.B -G
command option.  This is an enhancement of this implementation.
.IP \(em
No other implementation documents the
.BR -e ", " -n ", " -q ", " -v ", " -h ", " -V " and " -C
options.  They will not be used by portable command scripts. 
.IP \(em
Options
.BR --help " and " --version
are provided for compatibility with GNU coding standards (GNITS);
.BR --copying ,
OpenSS7 coding standards.
.IP \(em
.B ifrtune
attempts to be source (and script) compatible with historical implementations
based on
.IR "Spider Frame Relay" ,
however, binary compatibility is not attempted.  Any binary compatability
acheived is likely to be removed in a subsequent release.
.PP
For additional compatibility considerations, see
.BR ifr (4),
.BR ifrtemplate (5),
and
.BR STREAMS (9).
