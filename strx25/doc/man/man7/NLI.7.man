.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Network Layer Interface (NLI) is a service primitive interface to the X.25
Packet Layer Protocol (X25-PLP) developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now part of
Emmerson Power) for use by applications in controlling X.25 Packet Layer
Protocol software.  The service primitive interface was widely used on
VxWorks, other embedded RTOS,
AIXlink/X.25,
.[
aixlink
.]
HP-UX X.25,
.[
hpuxdoc
.]
IRIS SX.25,
.[
sx25
.]
Sun Microsystems SunLink starting with version 8.0 and Solstice X.25,
.[
solx25pg
.]
PT X.25,
.[
ptx25
.]
SBE X.25,
.[
sbex25
.]
RadiSys WAN,
.[
radwan
.]
and other mainstream UNIX operating systems and embedded systems for
communications.
.PP
The interface is not provided as a programming library, as is XTI, but as
defined service primitives to be exchanged with the X.25 PLP driver using
standard STREAMS
.BR getpmsg (2s)
and
.BR putpmsg (2s)
system calls.  Although a user level library could be easily constructed from
these service primtives, in the same way that XTI was built from TPI, it does
not seem to have happened and applications appear to have wound up using the
NLI directly.
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
and other \fBOpenSS7\fP applications, drivers and modules provide primarily a
Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
for devices at this level; however, a compatibility module,
.BR s_nli (4),
is provided to convert between NPI and SpiderX.25 NLI interface for the purposes
of porting SpiderX.25 compatible applications, drivers and modules to
\fBLinux\fP.

    unsigned char NSAP[NSAPMAXSIZE];
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP
.I sn_id
The subnetwork identifier, selected by the system administrator.  It
identifies the subnetwork required for a Connect Request, or on which a
Connect Indication arrived.  The
.I sn_id
field holds a representation of the one byte string subnetwork identifier as
an unsigned long.  The X.25 library routine
.BR snidtox25 (3)
can be used to conver the character subnetwork identifier to an unsigned long.
.TP
.I aflags
Specifies the options requird (or used) by the subnetwork to encode and
interpret addresses.  When there is a value in the
.I NSAP
field,
.I aflags
takes one of three values, listed below.  When the
.I NSAP
field is empty,
.I aflags
has the value zero
.RB ( 0 ).
See
.BR xaddrf "(5),
.BR stox25 "(3),
.BR x25tos "(3) and
.BR getxhostent (3)
for details about the X.25 address format.
.RS
.TP
.B 0
.I NSAP
field contains an OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) encoded NSAP address.
.TP
.B 1
.I NSAP
field contains a non-OSI encoded extended address.
.TP
.B 2
.I DTE_MAC
field contains the logical channel identifier (LCI) of a permanent virtual
circuit (PVC).
.RE
.TP
.I DTE_MAC
Holds the DTE address, the MAC+SAP (medium access control plus service access
point) address or the LCI.  This is binary.  The
.B lsapformat
structure is described below.
.TP
.I nsap_len
This indicates the length of the NSAP, if any (and where appropriate), in
semi-octets.
.TP
.I NSAP
This carries the NSAP or address extension (see field
.IR aflags )
when present as indicated by
.IR nsap_len .
This is binary.

};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
The fields in the
.B lsapformat
structure are defined as follows:
.TP
.I lsap_len
This gives the length of the DTE address, the MAC+SAP address, or the LCI in
semi-octets.  For example, for Ethernet, the length is always 14 to indicate
the MAC (12) plus SAP (2).  The SAP always follows the MAC address.  The DTE
can be up to 15 decimal digits unless X.25(88) and TOA/NPI (Type Of
Address/Numbering Plan Identification) addressing is being used, when it can
be up to 17 decimal digits.  For an LCI the length is 3.
.TP
.I lsap_add
This holds the DTE, MAC+SAP or LCI, when present, as indicated by
.IR lsap_len .
This is binary.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Spider Network Layer Interface (NLI) is a proprietary interface without
a \fIformal\fP standard (although its widespread use makes it an \fIipso
facto\fP standard).  The Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
should be used in its stead.
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation of the NLI has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

The

interface is compatible with SpiderX25,
and implementations based on SpiderX25, such as
AIXlink/X.25,
.[
aixlink
.]
HP-UX X.25,
.[
hpuxdoc

IRIS SX.25,

PT X.25,
.[
ptx25
.]
SBE X.25,
.[
sbex25
.]
RadiSys WAN,
.[
radwan
.]
and others, with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Many implementations of SpiderX.25 used under license have deviated from binary
compatibility with the original interface specifications, both in the form and
style of primitives and in the form of input-output controls supported.
.RS
.PP
Many implementations also provide their own extensions to the interface which
are incompatible with all other implementations.  May of these extensions are
purportedly in support of vendor-specific hardware, or systems.
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
attempts to maintain \fIsource\fP compatibilty with the core features provided
by most implementations, but compatibility with all features of all
implementations is not possible.
Your mileage may vary.
.RE
.IP \(em
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides a core \fIsource\fP compatible implementations of the SpiderWAN
interface for the purposes of porting legacy NLI applications, drivers and
modules to \fBLinux\fP with a minimal porting effort.
While \fIsource\fP compatibility with core features is attempted, \fIbinary\fP
compatibility is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced could be
broken in a subsequent release.
.RS
.PP
New applications should use the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
instead.
.RE
