.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B NPI-X25
provides a Stream support the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
to the X.25 Packet Layer Protocol (X25-PLP),
.[
x25
.]
.[
iso 8208
.]
driver,
.BR x25-plp (4).
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
This
.IR STREAMS (4)
interface provides the
.BR x25 (4)
protocol service interface using the N-primitves of the
.BR npi (7).
THis interface is intended solely for use by user programs or protocol modules
requiring the common
.BR npi (7)
service interface.  In particular, the
.BR npi (7)
interface to
.BR x25 (4)
is often used by CONS
.[
x223
.]
and other telecommunications protocols such as XOT internal to the kernel.
This is because the
.B NPI-X25
interface provides some richer control that is not available in the
.BR tpi_x25 (7)
interface or the
.BR xti_x25 (3)
library.

.SH ADDRESS FORMATS

The X.25 address format is structured as follows:

NPI defines the following standard CONS Quality of Service parameter formats
that are also applicable to X.25:
.SS N_QOS_CO_RANGE
.PP
Used with \fBN_CONN_REQ\fP(7) and \fBN_CONN_IND\fP(7), the structure indicates
the range of Quality of Service parameters from which the NS User is permitted
to select.
.SS N_QOS_CO_SEL
.PP
Used with \fBN_CONN_RES\fP(7) and \fBN_CONN_CON\fP(7), the structure indicates
the Quality of Service parameters selected by the peer NS User and NS
Provider.
.SS N_QOS_CO_OPT_RANGE
.PP
Used with \fBN_OPTMGMT_REQ\fP(7) and \fBN_INFO_ACK\fP, specifies the range of
Quality of Service parameters acceptable to the NS User.
.SS N_QOS_CO_OPT_SEL
.PP
Used with \fBN_OPTMGMT_REQ\fP(7) and \fBN_INFO_ACK\fP, specifies the Quality
of Service parameters selected for the connection.
.PP
NPI defines the following X.25 and non-X.25 Quality of Service and Facilities
parameter formats that are applicable to X.25:
.SS N_QOS_X25_RANGE
.PP
Used with \fBN_CONN_REQ\fP(7) and \fBN_CONN_IND\fP(7), the structure indicates
the range of Quality of Service parameters from which the NS User is permitted
to select.
