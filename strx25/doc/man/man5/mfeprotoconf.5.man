.SH NAME
.B mfeprotoconf
\- Multi-Protocol over Frame Relay Encapsulation Protocol File Format
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B mfeprotoconf
describes the file format for input to the
.BR mfeproto (8)
command for Multiprotoocl over Frame Relay Encapsulation by subnetwork.  The
file format consists of a number of paraemter values, one per line, formatted as
described below.  Each parameter value is described using its line number in the
file, a parameter name, and a description of the format of the value.  Only the
value appears in the file, each value on a line by itself, one value per line.
.PP
Each of the MFE protoocl configuration parameters corresponds to the member and
values of the
.B mfe_proto
structure, that is carried in a
.BR MFE_PADD ", " MFE_PGET " or " MF_PDEL
intpu-output control.
.PP
These protocol parameters, and the default values that exist when tuning has not
been applied to a newly created MFE subnetwork, correspond directly to the
protocol parameters and defaults of RFC 2427,
.[
rfc2427
.]
X.36 Annex D,
.[
x36
.]
and FRF 3.2.
.[
frf3_2
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The MFE subnetwork template consists of 7 or more lines containing the following
configuration information:
.IP 1. \w'00.\(em'u
.B MINPDUSZ
Specifies the minimum frame size that will be delivered to the MFE user for this
protocol encapsulation.  The value must be less than or equal to the maximum
DLSDU size for the corresponding subnetwork.  This value should not be shorter
than the shortest demultiplexing string, as described for lines 5 through 7.
The value is a decimal number in units of octets.
.IP 2.
.B ENCAPS
Specifies the encapsulation header that will be prepended to all outgoing
frames.  Note that the encapsulation header does not include padding applied to
the Frame Relay headers.  The value is an even-length string of hexadecimal
characters.
A zero length string can be indicated by two dashes (\*(lq\fB--\fP\*(rq) or an empty line.
.IP 3.
.B RETAIN
Specifies whether or not to retain the encapsulation on received frames when
deliverying received frames to the MPE user.  The default for all subnetworks is
\*(lq\fBN\fP\*(rq.  The value of this parameter can be one of the following:
.RS
.TS
tab(:);
cb1c1l.
N:\-:trim encapsulation header
Y:\-:leave encapsulation header intact
.TE
.RE
.IP 4.
.B COUNT
Provides a count (from zero (0) to three (3)) of the strings that will be used
for demultiplexing received packets from the subnetwork.  The value is a decimal
number in the range from 0 to 3 and also specifies the number of lines in the
configuration file following this one that are significant.
.IP 5.
.B DEMUX1
Specifies the first demultiplexing string.  \fBCOUNT\fP must be greater than or
equal to 1 for this parameter to be significant.
The value is an even-length string of hexadecimal digits.
A zero length string can be indicated by two dashes (\*(lq\fB--\fP\*(rq) or an empty line.
.IP 6.
.B DEMUX2
Specifies the second demultiplexing string.  \fBCOUNT\fP must be greater than or
equal to 2 for this parameter to be significant.
The value is an even-length string of hexadecimal digits.
A zero length string can be indicated by two dashes (\*(lq\fB--\fP\*(rq) or an empty line.
.IP 7.
.B DEMUX3
Specifies the third demultiplexing string.  \fBCOUNT\fP must be greater than or
equal to 3 for this parameter to be significant.
The value is an even-length string of hexadecimal digits.
A zero length string can be indicated by two dashes (\*(lq\fB--\fP\*(rq) or an empty line.
.PP
The following lines are extensions:
.IP 8. \w'00.\(em'u
.B DEMUX4
Additional demultiplexing strings can be specified, allowing \fBCOUNT\fP to
exceed three (3).

.SH FILES
.PP
Files following this format are normally kept in the
.B @configdir@/@PACKAGE@/template/
directory.
.PP
(Note that this directory varies depending on whether the build was on a
.BR dpkg (1)-based
or
.BR rpm (1)-based
system.)

.B mfeprotoconf
file format is compatible with
