.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B x25template
describes the file format for input to the
.BR x25tune (8)
command for X.25 subnetworks.
The file format consists of a number of parameter values, one per line,
formated as described below.  Each parameter value is described using its line
number in the file, a parameter name, and a description of the format of the
value.  Only the value appears in the file, each value on a line by itself, one
value per line.
.PP
Each of the X.25 configuration parameters corresponds to the member and values
of the
.B wlcfg
structure by the
.B N_snconfig
and
.B N_snread
input-output control.
.PP
These protocol parameters, and the default values that exist when tuning has
not been applied to a newly created X.25 subnetwork, correspond directly to the
protocol parameters and defaults in ISO/IEC 8208,

.B SUB_FSELECT
(Fast Select Acceptance) is an optional user facility agreed for a period of
time.  This user facility, if subscribed to, authorizes the DCE to transmit to
the DTE incoming calls that request the fast select facility.  In the absence
of this facility, the DCE will not transmit to the DTE incoming calls that
request the fast select facility.  This parameter defines whether the DTE
accepts calls with a fast select facility requesting no restriction on
response.
The value is \*(lq\fBY\fP\*(rq for use and \*(lq\fBN\fP\*(rq for non-use.

(Fast Select Acceptance) is an optional user facility agreed for a period of

the DTE incoming calls that request the fast select facility.  In the absence
of this facility, the DCE will not transmit to the DTE incoming calls that
request the fast select facility.  This parameter defines whether the DTE

.IP 53.
.B SUB_REVCHARGE
(Reverse Charging Acceptance) is an optional user facility agree for a period
of time for virtual calls.  This user facility, if subscribed to, authorizes
the DCE to transmit to the DTE incoming calls that request the reverse
charging facility.  In the absence of this facility, the DCE will not transmit
to the DTE incoming calls that request the reverse charging facility.
The value is \*(lq\fBY\fP\*(rq for use and \*(lq\fBN\fP\*(rq for non-use.
.IP 54.
.B SUB_LOC_CHG_PREV
(Local Charging Prevention)
is an optional user faciltiy agreed for a period of time for virtual calls.
This user facility, if subscribed to, authorizes the DCE to prevent the
establishment of virtual calls that the suscriber must pay for by: a) not
transmitting to the DTE incoming calls that request the reverse charging
facility; and, b) ensuring that the charges are made to another party whether
a call is requested by the DTE.  When the party to be changed has not been
established for a call request, the DCE that receives the call request packet
will apply reverse charging to this call.
The value is \*(lq\fBY\fP\*(rq for use and \*(lq\fBN\fP\*(rq for non-use.
.IP 55.
.B BAR_INCALL
(Incoming Calls Barred) determines whether the optional user facility is
agreed for a period of time.  This facility applies to all logical channels
used at the DTE/DCE interface for virtual calls.  This user facility, if
subscribed to, prevents incoming virtual calls from being presented to the
DTE.  The DTE may originate outgoing virtual calls.  Logical chanels used for
virtual calls retain their full duplex capability.  Some administratoins may
provide a capability that allows a virtual call to be presented to the DTE
only in cases where the called DTE address is the address of the calling DTE.
The value is \*(lq\fBY\fP\*(rq for use and \*(lq\fBN\fP\*(rq for non-use.
.IP 56.
.B BAR_OUTCALL
(Outgoing Calls Barred) determines whether the optional user facilty is agreed
for a period of time.  This facility applies to all logical channels used at
the DTE/DCE interface for virtual calls.  This user facility, if subscribed
to, prevents the DCE from accepting outgoing virtual calls from the DTE.  The
DTE may receive incoming virtual calls.  Logical channels used for virtual
calls retain their full duplex capability.
The value is \*(lq\fBY\fP\*(rq for use and \*(lq\fBN\fP\*(rq for non-use.
.IP 57.
.B SUB_TOA_NPI_FMT
(TOA/NPI Address) is an optional user facility agreed for a period of time for
virtual calls.  When this facility is subscribed to, the DCE and DTE shall
transmit call set-up and clearing packets only using the TOA/NPI address
format.  In this case, addresses in facilities are also in TOA/NPI format.
The value is \*(lq\fBY\fP\*(rq for use and \*(lq\fBN\fP\*(rq for non-use.
.IP 58.
.B BAR_TOA_NPI_FMT
(TOA/NPI Address Incoming Calls Barred) is a user option that bars incoming

The value is \*(lq\fBY\fP\*(rq for use and \*(lq\fBN\fP\*(rq for non-use.
.IP 59.
.B SUB_NUI_OVERRIDE
(NUI Override) is an optional user facility agreed for a period of time for
virtual calls.  When this facility is subscribed to, one or more network user
identifiers are also agreed for a period of time.  Associated with each
network user identifier is a set of subscription-time optional user
facilities.  When one of these network user identifiers is provdied in a call
request packet by means of the NUI selection facility, the set of
subscription-time optional user facilities associated with it overrides the
facilities that apply to the interface.  This override does not apply to other
existing calls or subsequent calls on the interface.  It remains in effect for
the duration of the particular call to which it applies.

.B T24VALUE
(Window Status Transmission Timer)
is the time period that the DTE will wait without sending a window status
packet (a packet with a P(R): RR, RNR, DATA or REJECT).
The timeout value should not be less than 180 seconds.
The value is in integral units of deciseconds (0.1 seconds), so an interval of
180 seconds is specified as 1800 (deciseconds).

(Reject Response Timer)
is the time period that the DTE will await a data retransmission after
issuing a reject.
