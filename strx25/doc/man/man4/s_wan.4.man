.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" ,
and most OpenSS7 packages, utilize the Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.[
cdi revision 0.9.2
.]
.BR cdi (7),
or Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
as an interface to WAN devices.  However, due to the widespread use in the 1990's of systems
deploying SpiderWAN, SpiderX.25
.[
spiderx25wan
.]
and SpiderISDN,
.[
spiderisdnwan
.]
a number of applications programs, as well as \fISTREAMS\fP(9) drivers and modules may
have been written to these interfaces.  Therefore, to provide compatibility
between the OpenSS7 CDI and DLPI implementations of WAN devices and applications,
modules or drivers expecting a SpiderWAN interface, the \fBS_WAN\fP module was
developed to provide source compatibility with these programs.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH PRIMITIVES
.PP
When the \fBs_wan\fP module is pushed, the
.BR cdi (7)
service interface is converted to be (source) compatible with the Spider WAN
service interface, see \*(lq\fICOMPATIBILITY\fP,\*(rq below.
Declarations of structures and symbolic constants necessary for this service
interface are contained in the
.B @includedir@/@PACKAGE@/sys/wan_proto.h
header file.
The SpiderWAN (source) compatible service primitive interface is as follows:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
struct WAN_primitives {
    uint8_t wan_type;
    struct wan_sid wsid;
    struct wan_reg wreg;
    struct wan_ctl wctl;
    struct wan_msg wmsg;
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.SS WAN_SID
.PP
Requests that the WAN driver assign the specified subnetwork identifier to the
Stream and associate the Stream with the underlying device identified by the
subnetwork identifier.
This primitive is equivalent to the
.BR CD_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive of the
.BR cdi (7),
and the
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive of the
.BR dlpi (7).
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
struct wan_sid {
    uint8_t wan_type;
    uint8_t wan_spare[3];
    uint32_t wan_snid;
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'\fIwan_remaddr\fP\(em'u
.I wan_type
Always \fBWAN_SID\fP.
.TP
.I wan_spare
Spare bytes for alignment, ignored by responder and set to zero by initiator.
.TP
.I wan_snid
Conveys the subnetwork identifier.
Equivalent to the Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) of the WAN interface.
.PP
Should an error condition occur, an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message is sent upstream with an appropriate error code, resulting in the
failure of all system calls on the Stream until closed.
The \fBWAN_SID\fP primitive may fail when:
.TP \w'[\fBENODEV\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ ENODEV ]
The \fIwan_snid\fP member is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The \fBM_PROTO\fP(9) message block is of an incorrect length for the
primitive.
.TP
.RB [ EEXIST ]
The \fIwan_snid\fP specified is in use by another Stream.
.TP
.RB [ ERANGE ]
The \fIwan_snid\fP member contains invalid information.
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
The a physical channel referenced by the \fIwan_snid\fP is in use by another
Stream.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
The \fBs_wan\fP module, or underlying CDI or DLPI driver lacks the STREAMS resources
necessary to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
The \fBWAN_SID\fP primitive was issued from an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
The underlying device driver has encountered a fatal error.
.\"
.SS WAN_REG
.PP
.PP
.nf

    uint8_t wan_type;

\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'\fIwan_remaddr\fP\(em'u
.I wan_type

.TP
.I wan_snid

The Spider Wide Area Network (WAN) interface is a proprietary interface without
a \fIformal\fP standard (although its widespread use makes it an \fIipso
facto\fP standard).  Either the Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.[
cdi revision 0.9.2
.]
.BR cdi (7),
or the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
