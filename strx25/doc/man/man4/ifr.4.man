\- Frame Relay STREAMS driver
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
\fB#include <sys/stream.h>\fP
.HP
\fBint\fP \fIifr_stream\fP = \fBopen\fP(\fIifr_device\fP, \fIflags\fP);
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Frame Relay driver, \fBIFR\fP, is a \fISTREAMS\fP multiplexing driver that
provides support for Q.933
.[
q933
.]
Frame Relay.
.PP
\fBIFR\fP is a multiplexing driver.  The upper multiplex service interface is
the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) Revision 2.0.0.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
The MAC type for this upper multiplex service interface is
.BR DL_FRAME .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
During system initialization, an IFR daemon agent opens the \fBIFR\fP driver
and links a number of WAN Streams,
.BR wan (4),
beneath the multiplexing driver using the
.BR I_LINK (7)
.I STREAMS
input-output controls
.BR streamio (7).
Linking WAN Streams in this fashion associates WAN data link Streams for use by
the \fBIFR\fP driver Stream.
.PP
The linked WAN Streams are then configured using the \fBW_SNREG\fP input-output
control, described below under \*(lq\fIIOCTLS\fP.\*(rq.
.PP
Streams opened on the \fBIFR\fP driver may be used directly by user-level
programs, or linked under additional Streams multiplexing drivers such as the
.BR mfe (4)
multiplexing driver.
