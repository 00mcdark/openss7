.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
and most OpenSS7 packages, utilize the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
as an interface to LLI devices.  However, due to the widespread use in the 1990's of systems
deploying SpiderWAN, SpiderX.25
.[
spiderx25
.]
and SpiderISDN
.[
spiderisdn
.]
a number of applications programs, as well as \fISTREAMS\fP(9) drivers and modules may have been
written to provide these interfaces.  Therefore, to provide compatibility between the OpenSS7 DLPI
implementations of applications and user modules or drivers expecting a DLPI interface, the
\fBS_DLPI\fP module was developed to provide source compatibility with these modules or drivers.
.PP
The \fBS_DLPI\fP module is a pushable \fISTREAMS\fP(9) module that performs
conversion between the Spider
.IR "Link Layer Interface (LLI)" ,
.[
lli revision 0.9.2
.]
interface at the lower service interface, and the
.IR "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)" ,
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
at the upper service interface.

.SH USAGE

.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Spider Link Layer Interface (LLI) is, to some degree, a proprietary
interface without a \fIformal\fP standard (although its widespread use makes
it an \fIipso facto\fP standard).
The Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
should be used in its stead.
