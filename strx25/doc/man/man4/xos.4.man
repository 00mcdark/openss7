.SH NAME
.B xos
\- X.25 over SCTP (XOS)
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B XOS
is an implementation of X.25 PLP over SCTP (XOS) simular to that which is
described in RFC 1613
.[
rfc1613
.]
for TCP.
RFC 1613
.[
rfc1613
.]
describes use of ISO 8881
.[
ISO/IEC 8881:1989
.]
X.25
.[
x25
.]
Packet Layer Protocol over TCP (XOT) using independent TCP connections
to Registered TCP Port Number 1998 as VCs.
.PP
A similar approach using SCTP (XOS) on the same IANA registered port number
1998, could prove more viable.  SCTP supports multiple independent Streams each
of which can be paired to support multiple VCs on the same SCTP association.
This would obviate the need as in TCP to esablish a new transport connection
for each VC.  X.25 normally only supports about 4096 VCs.  An SCTP association
can allocate up to 16384 independent streams and could easily allocate a stream
per VC in each direction.  This would permit forming an SCTP association per
interface pairing instead an alleviate the need to generate pseudo-interface
identifiers for each TCP connection.  One local and remote interface identifier
could be assigned to the SCTP association and and VCs assigned to streams
according to their natural numbering.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Not yet implemented, but here is a stab at explaining the design:
.PP
The following steps would be taken:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
A user application or configuration daemon would open
.BR sctp (4)
Streams and connect them to hosts that provide X.25 interface connectivity.
.IP 2.
One
.BR sctp (4)
Stream would be opened for each remote interface.
Connections would be made to IANA regsitered port number 1998.
.IP 3.
The configuration program pushes the
.B XOS
pushable
.I STREAMS
module on the
.BR sctp (4)
Stream and configures it with a remote interface identifier using either
.BR dlpi (7)
primitives or an input-output control.
This results in the negotiation of the remote interface identifier with the
remote host using SCTP stream 0.
.IP 4.
The resulting
.BR dlpi (7)
Stream can be linked beneath an X.25 PLP,
.BR plp (4),
multiplexing driver to provide data link services to the X.25 PLP.
.IP 5.
The
.BR plp (4)
routing tables can be updated to provide access to X.25 PLP upper multiplex
Streams to the DLPI driver beneath using configurtion commands normal to the
X.25 PLP multiplexing driver.
.IP 6.
X.25 routing functions can be performed using the DLPI Stream from within the
X.25 PLP driver without the user having to further open an NPI Stream.
.IP 7.
When (and if) it comes time to establish an X.25 SVC, the user opens an X.25
PLP Stream (presenting the
.BR npi (7)
interface) and binds and listens, or connects, the X.25 PLP or X.75 NPI Stream
as normal.
.IP 8.
The
.B XOS
module intercepts information from the X.25 PLP packets and performs the
actions necessary to map packets to SCTP Streams and adjust packet headers as
required to perform the convergence functions in a manner similar to that
described for TCP in RFC 1613.
.[
rfc1613
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
The service interface to the
.B xos
module is the
.I Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
Type II interface.
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSES
.PP
The
.B xos
address format is a DLSAP.  In the case of
.BR xos ,
the DLSAP is an interface identifier or an IP address and port number.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
All OSI DLPI options apply but perhaps not all can be supported by SCTP.  For
SCTP it would be easier to translate QOS parameters into SCTP protocol
parameters than it is for TCP.
.\"
.\"
.SH PRIMITIVES
.PP
.BR dlpi (7)
connection-oriented primitives.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
.BR dlpi (7)
defined input-output controls.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
This module is yet to be implemented.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Implementing
.B xos
should be less cumbersome than
.BR xot (4).
.B XOS
could be implemented as multiplexing driver under
.IR STREAMS .
An
.BR sctp (4)
Stream would be opened and then linked under the
.B XOS
driver, either permanently or temporarily.
Once linked, the application would be able to open the
.B /dev/xos
driver, presenting an
.BR npi (7)
interface, and bind the Stream to an interface identifier or IP address and a
virtual call or other NSAP.
.PP
Another approach would be to link the
.BR sctp (4)
Stream under a multiplexing driver presenting a
.BR dlpi (7)
interface on the upper side of the multiplex.  Then
.BR dlpi (7)
streams could be opened and connected in much the same fashion as an X.25 LAPB
DLPI Stream would.  These Streams could then be linked under a standard X.25
PLP multiplex presenting an
.BR npi (7)
interface at its upper boundary (for X.75 Multi-Link Protocol), or could have
an X.25 PLP module pushed over it (for X.25 Single-Link Protocol).
