Abstract

    This document is a revision to RFC 1613 [RFC1613] written by James
  R. Forster, Greg Satz, Gilbert Glick and Bob Day.  Since the release
  of RFC 1613 in May 1994, a new IP transport protocol, Stream Control
  Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [SCTP], has been released as a Proposed
  Standard that provides superior services to TCP in some respects,
  particularly related to OSI or Signalling protocols.

    This memo describes the mechanism to allow X.25-PLP to run directly
  over SCTP over IPv4 or IPv6.  It also defines a number of new features

  that were not provided in RFC 1613, but are now possible due to the
  superior capabilities provided by SCTP.

    The goal of this version is to minimize the number of changes to RFC
  1613 as well as ITU-T Rec. X.25 [X.25] or ISO/IEC 8208 [ISO/IEC 8208]
  while maximizing performance, extending its applicability and
  protecting the installed base of RFC 1613 users.

1.  Introduction

    It is sometimes desirable to transport X.25 over IP internets.  The
  X.25 Packet Level requires a reliable link level below it and normally
  uses LAPB [ISO 7776], [X.222] or LLC2 [802.2].  XOT [RFC1613]
  describes a method for using a TCP/IP connection as a data link over
  which X.25 PLP (Packet Layer Protocol) [ISO/IEC 8208] packets can be
  sent.  This memo documents a method of sending X.25 PLP packets over
  IP internets by encapsulating the X.25 Packet Level in SCTP [SCTP]
  packets.

    SCTP provides a set of reliable sequenced or un-sequenced packets in
  independent streams.  X.25 requires that the layer beneath it provide
  message semantics, in particular the boundary between packets.  SCTP
  preserves message boundaries and with no need for additional headers.
  Also, the SCTP PPI field provides a way to identify the version of the
  protocol.

    In contrast, the TCP approach with XOT [RFC1613] does not preserve
  message boundaries directly, and requires a header field, both to
  preserve message boundaries as well as to provide a protocol version
  number.

    In general, the normal X.25 protocol packet formats and state
  transition rules apply to the X.25 layer in XOS.  Exceptions to this
  are noted.

1.1.  Scope

1.1.1.  Advantages of XOS over XOT

    XOS has a number of unique advantages over XOT [RFC1613], as
  itemized below:

   (1)   SCTP preserves message boundaries without additional protocol
         elements (such as the header required by TCP in XOT to recover
         record boundaries).

   (2)   SCTP can identify the transported protocol using the Payload
         Protocol Identifier.

   (3)   SCTP provides a heartbeat mechanism that detects failure faster
         than TCP is able.  Thus, SCTP associations can be established
         and left idle awaiting call setups.  This, again permits faster
         call setup.

Internet Draft            X.25 over SCTP (XOS)               May 1, 2009

   (4)   SCTP detects lost associations and has a quick restart
         procedure for reestablishing them.  TCP can take minutes to
         reestablish a connection and when confronted with
         reestablishing 4095 connections, temporary network conditions
         can be disastrous.

   (5)   SCTP provides a measure of the quality of service experienced
         by the SCTP association (smoothed round trip time) that can be
         used to support X.25 and CONS quality of service parameters and
         data link resource allocations.

   (6)   XOS only requires one association for per data link and
         utilizes streams within the SCTP association to provide for
         independence of flow for individual virtual channels.  XOT, on
         the other hand, requires one TCP connection per virtual
         channel.  Therefore, XOS uses less resources per virtual
         channel and scales better.  Also, XOS avoids the additional
         call setup delay associated with establishing a TCP connection.

    These and the additional capabilities of SCTP make XOS a superior
  replacement to XOT.

1.1.2.  Relationship of XOS to XOT

    The XOS protocol described in this memo is not intended as a
  replacement for XOT [RFC1613], but XOS is intended, where available,
  as a superior alternative to XOT.

    The XOT specification [RFC1613], was used as a template for the
  initial drafts of this memo.  However, RFC 1613 provides sections that
  are not applicable to XOS, as follows:

   (1)   The XOT specification [RFC1613], went to some length to
         describe the interactions between an XOT interface and an X.25
         interface on a given host to provide an network relay function.
         This function, however, has since been standardized as ISO/IEC
         10028 [ISO/IEC 10028] and ISO/IEC 10177 [ISO/IEC 10177], and,
         therefore, does not need to be discussed here.  Also, because
         the X.25 PLP and CONS relay function is a purely nodal
         function, it has no impact on protocol design.

         Those sections of the XOT specification that spoke to network
         layer relays and interworking units have been removed from XOS.
         The procedures of ISO 10177 [ISO/IEC 10028], [ISO/IEC 10177]
         are as applicable to XOS as they are to LAPB [ISO 7776],
         [X.222], [ISO 3309], [ISO 4335] or LLC [ISO 8881], [802.2], and
         the reader is referred to those documents [ISO/IEC 10028],
         [ISO/IEC 10177].

   (2)   The XOT specification went to some trouble to remove the
         distinction between DTE, DCE and DXE as provided for in X.25
         and ISO 8208.  This was possible because the TCP connection
         only supported one anonymous virtual channel and Logical

Internet Draft            X.25 over SCTP (XOS)               May 1, 2009

         Channel Identifier assignment became trivial.  Unfortunately,
         this resulted in modifications to the X.25 engine: removal of
         the distinction between DTE, DCE and DXE, and the removal of
         the restart procedures and all messages sent to the null
         reference.

         XOS reinstates the traditional role of DTE, DCE and DXE as
         described in X.25 and ISO 8208 and provides for the restart
         procedure and other procedures on the null reference.  XOS in
         this way provides an identical service interface to that of the
         LAPB or LLC2 data links and does not require any X.25 PLP
         protocol or procedural modifications whatsoever.  Therefore,
         the passages on the loss of distinction between the role of
         DTE, DCE and DXE, and the loss of the restart and LCI
         assignment procedures from the X.25 PLP have been removed.

   (3)   The XOT specification, because only one virtual channel was
         supported per TCP connection, and because the LCI assignment
         procedures were removed, had to specify a non-standard message
         for use in specifying or establishing Permanent Virtual
         Circuits.  This again required modifications to the X.25 PLP
         protocol and procedures to support PVCs on XOT.

         XOS reinstates the normal static assignment of LCI for PVCs and
         does not require additional non-standard messages to support
         PVCs.  PVC Setup is, once again, a matter for management
         systems and the corresponding section from RFC 1613, "PVC
         Setup", has been removed from this Memo.

1.2.  Terminology

    This memo uses the following extended terminology:

  Virtual Channel -- A virtual channel over which an X.25 connection is
      established using X.25 call setup procedures.

  Permanent Virtual Channel -- A virtual channel over which an X.25
      connection is permanently established without the need for the use
      of call setup procedures.

1.3.  Abbreviations

    The following abbreviations are used throughout this memo:

      CC      -- Call Confirm (X.25 message)
      DC      -- Disconnect Confirm (X.25 message)
      DCE     -- Data Control Equipment

3.  Overview

3.1.  Relationship Between XOS and X.25

    When a networking device (a host, router, etc.) has an X.25 engine
  (i.e., an X.25 PLP [ISO/IEC 8208] protocol implementation), that
  engine may be connected to interface(s) running LAPB [ISO 7776],
  [X.222], [ISO 3309], [ISO 4335], and/or to logical interface(s)
  running LLC [ISO 8881], [802.2], XOT/TCP/IP [RFC1613] or XOS/SCTP/IP.
  In general, the XOS layer itself is not at all sensitive to what kind
  of packets the X.25 engine passes to it.  However, to improve
  interoperability between separate implementations, this document in
  some cases does specify behaviour for the X.25 engine.

Internet Draft            X.25 over SCTP (XOS)               May 1, 2009

    While this document primarily discusses XOS from the perspective of
  providing X.25 connectivity using XOS, this should not prevent a host
  from switching X.25 traffic (i.e, connecting an X.25 Virtual Circuit
  between the local X.25 interfaces of two networking devices).  In
  general, the X.25 PLP is unaware that the data link services are being
  provided by XOS/SCTP/IP and therefore the standards applicable to
  network internal layer services [ISO/IEC 10028] and network layer
  relay and protocol interworking [ISO/IEC 10177] are as applicable to
  X.25 PLP using XOS and LAPB as they are to X.25 PLP using LLC2 and
  LAPB.

3.2.  Overall Packet Format

    The entire encapsulated packet has the format illustrated in
  Figure 1.

    RFC convention is that a packet format is represented graphically
  with the data sent first above the data sent later.  This convention
  is followed in this document, and therefore, while we refer to X.25
  being transported over SCTP, we draw the packet format with the X.25
  portion of the packet lower on the page than the SCTP portion.

    X.25 PLP frames are simply encapsulated in SCTP DATA Chunks in the
  same manner as normal SCTP user data.

3.3.  SCTP Association, Port Number, and Logical Channel Identifiers

    A single SCTP stream MUST be used for each X.25 virtual circuit.  A
  separate SCTP stream SHOULD be used for each X.25 virtual circuit.
  Each Virtual Circuit (VC) relating to the same Data Link, however, is
  carried by a stream within a single SCTP association.  All connections
  MUST be made to SCTP port number 1998.  This port number is an IANA
  Registered Port Number registered by cisco Systems; cisco has
  designated it for use by XOT for TCP.  This memo recommends the use of
  the same port number, 1998, for use by XOS for SCTP.  See Section 9,
  "IANA Considerations for more information on port number.

    The SCTP association MUST be created before the virtual circuit can
  be established.  The SCTP association MAY be maintained after the last
  virtual circuit associated with the SCTP association has been cleared
  or MAY be released in accordance with X.25 and ISO 8208 data link
  procedures.  Note that the SCTP association corresponds to the LAPB
  [ISO 7776], [X.222], [ISO 3309], [ISO 4335] or LLC2 [ISO 8881],
  [802.2] link for X.25, and each SCTP stream corresponds to an
  individual Virtual Circuit (VC) and Logical Channel Identifier (LCI)
  for X.25 LAPB.  The Logical Channel Identifier (LCI) field in the X.25
  header maps to the SCTP stream upon which the message is sent.

    X.25 and ISO 8208 support the assignment of virtual circuits (VC)
  and permanent virtual circuits (PVC) to logical channel identifiers in
  the range from 1-4095 inclusive.  Logical channel identifier zero (0)
  is reserved for data link related messages (e.g., RESTART REQUEST).
  SCTP provides support for multiple quasi-independent streams of

  sequenced data records and can negotiate the number of outbound
  streams (between 1 and 65536) during association establishment.  In
  general, streams in SCTP are used to establish an ordered relationship
  between packets (all packets transmitted on the same stream with
  sequenced delivery will be delivered in order), and the stream
  identifier is not intended to be used to identifying virtual circuits
  of any kind.  For example, there is no requirement on SCTP peers to
  negotiation the same number of inbound streams as the number of

  outbound streams; and, there is no requirement to deliver the stream
  identifier as part of the information associated with received data.

    Therefore, the mapping between LCI and SCTP stream number is not an
  identity relationship (for all but LCI zero (0)).  Once a virtual
  circuit is assigned to an outbound SCTP stream, however, it SHOULD
  remain assigned to that stream for the lifetime of the connection,
  otherwise, ordered message sequencing will be at risk on the VC.  The
  XOS layer should provide the ability to distribute active VCs over the
  available outbound streams in as efficient a manner as possible,
  however, the precise algorithm for doing so is a local matter.  One
  way of accomplishing this is, indeed, by negotiating 4096 outbound
  streams with the SCTP peer and providing an identity mapping between
  LCI and SCTP stream number; however, this is not the only (nor most
  efficient) arrangement possible.

    Logical Channel Identifier zero (0), that is the "NULL" virtual
  circuit, refers to the data link and all contained VC and PVC, and is
  special in that messages sent on this LCI MUST be sent on SCTP stream
  number zero (0).  Messages sent on LCI zero (0) (and SCTP stream zero
  (0)) MAY be sent unordered.  No other messages (i.e. messages for LCI
  other than zero (0)) will be sent on SCTP stream zero (0), unless
  there is only one outbound stream negotiated (in which case all
  messages must be sent on stream zero (0)).  Which of the other
  available outbound streams is used for a particular LCI is a local
  matter; therefore, an XOS receiver MUST NOT use the inbound SCTP
  stream number to discriminate virtual circuits, but MUST use the LCI
  contained in the X.25 header (as is the case for normal X.25 and ISO
  8208 operation).

3.4.  Service Interfaces

    The upper layer service interface to XOS protocol functions is
  provided by the Data Link Provider service interface described in the
  ITU-T OSI Data Link Service Definition [X.212], and that described for
  IEEE 802.2 LLC operation [802.2].  The service primitives defined for
  the data link service are listed in Table 1.

    XOS is primarily concerned with the Connection-Oriented mode service
  primitives and mapping them onto the SCTP transport interface.

    The lower layer service interface providing services to XOS protocol
  function is provided by the SCTP (see Section 10 of RFC 4960) [SCTP].
  This service interface can be roughly modelled with the ITU-T OSI
  Transport Service Definition [X.214], as listed in Table 2.

    The mapping of Data Link Service Definition service primitives to
  SCTP primitives is straightforward, is listed  in Table 3, and is
  detailed in the subsections that follow.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------


4.1.  DL-CONNECT

    Upon receipt of an DL-CONNECT Request from the X.25 PLP, XOS will
  generate an SCTP-INITIALIZE and SCTP-ASSOCIATE primitive to SCTP.  The
  source address parameter from the DL-CONNECT Request will be used as
  the local port and local eligible address list in the SCTP-INITIALIZE
  primitive and the destination address parameter from the DL-CONNECT
  Request will be used as the destination address in the SCTP-ASSOCIATE
  primitive.  The priority parameter from the DL-CONNECT Request is
  ignored.  Once the SCTP ASSOCIATION has formed, XOS will issue a DL-
  CONNECT Confirm primitive to the X.25 PLP with the source address and
  destination address parameter corresponding to the SCTP source
  transport address and SCTP destination transport address.

    Upon receipt of an SCTP-ASSOCIATE primitive from SCTP, XOS will
  issue a DL-CONNECT Indication primitive to the X.25 PLP containing as
  the source and destination address parameters, the SCTP source and
  destination transport addresses.  Upon receipt of the DL-CONNECT
  Response primitive from the X.25 PLP, XOS will confirm the SCTP-
  ASSOCIATE primitive.  Upon receipt, the priority parameter is ignored,
  and when issued, the priority parameter is set to zero.  Note that
  normal LLC [802.2] procedures use the 48-bit MAC address for
  addresses, however, these 48 bits are normally opaque to the X.25 PLP
  implementation.  Conveniently, an IPv4 Address and Port number is also
  48 bits.  IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, are much longer.

Internet Draft            X.25 over SCTP (XOS)               May 1, 2009

4.2.  DL-DATA

    Upon receipt of a DL-DATA Request primitive from the X.25 PLP, XOS
  will generate an SCTP-SEND primitive with the same data parameter.
  The "stream id" and "unordered flag" parameter of the SCTP-SEND
  primitive is determined according to the rules described in the next
  section of this memo.

    Upon receipt of a SCTP-RECEIVE primitive from SCTP, XOS will issue a
  DL-DATA Indication primitive to the X.25 PLP containing the same data
  parameter.  The source and destination address parameters are derived
  from the SCTP association to which the SCTP-RECEIVE primitive applies.

4.3.  DL-RESET

    Upon receipt of an SCTP-RESTART-INDICATION, XOS will issue to the
  X.25 PLP a DL-RESET Indication primitive and expect a DL-RESET
  Response form the X.25 PLP.  Upon receive of the DL-RESET Response,
  the SCTP Restart procedure will be completed by XOS.

    Upon receipt of a DL-RESET Request primitive from the X.25 PLP, XOS
  will issue an SCTP-ABORT primitive to SCTP followed immediately by an
  SCTP-ASSOCIATE primitive for the same pairing of source transport
  address and destination transport address.  XOS should request that
  SCTP discard all data that has not been delivered at the time of the
  reset.  Once the procedure is complete, XOS will issue the DL-RESET
  Confirm primitive to the X.25 PLP.

4.4.  DL-DISCONNECT

    Upon receipt of a DL-DISCONNECT Request from the X.25 PLP, XOS will
  generate an SCTP-ABORT primitive to SCTP.  Upon receipt of an SCTP-
  ABORT primitive or any of the disconnection indications from SCTP
  (e.g., SCTP-COMMUNICATIONS-LOST), XOS will issue to the X.25 PLP a DL-
  DISCONNECT Indication primitive.  The reason parameter will be derived
  from the primitive or indication from SCTP.

5.  XOS Packets

    For each X.25 packet received from the SCTP connection to be sent
  out a local interface, an XOS implementation MUST set the packet's
  logical channel number to that used on the outgoing interface.  For
  the purposes of this RFC, a logical channel number is the 12 bit field
  confusingly defined by the X.25 Recommendations [X.25] as the high-
  order 4-bit "logical channel group number" and low-order 8-bit
  "logical channel number", where the latter phrase is used to refer to
  both the aggregated 12 bits and the low-order 8 bits.

    An XOS implementation SHOULD NOT modify the X.25 packet header
  information received on a local interface to be transmitted over the
  SCTP association.



B. Bidulock                    Version 0.0                       Page 12

Internet Draft            X.25 over SCTP (XOS)               May 1, 2009

    An XOS implementation MUST modify the X.25 packet header information
  as required for proper X.25 protocol operation for packets received on
  an SCTP association to be transmitted over a local interface.

    An XOS implementation MAY support connection between interfaces that
  use different flow control modulos.  If this feature is supported, XOS
  MUST modify the packet General Format Identifier on all packets
  received over the SCTP connection to set the proper modulus
  identifier.

5.1.  Transmission of XOS Packets

    The XOS layer receives service primitives requires for transmission
  in the same manner as the data link provider [X.212], [DLPI] for LAPB
  [ISO 7776], [X.222] or LLC2 [802.2].  The X.25 PLP (DXE) is
  responsible for resolving LCI assignment conflicts and completing the
  LCI field of the X.25 header for packets.  The packets are then
  delivered to the XOS layer using the DL-DATA Request primitive.  The
  XOS layer may examine the packet for the content of the LCI
  assignment, and uses a table to map the LCI from the X.25 header in
  the message to an SCTP stream number.  When the packet is a CC packet
  establishing a connection, the entry in the mapping table for LCI to
  SCTP stream is first populated.  Once a DC is packet is received, the
  associated entry in the mapping table for the released virtual circuit
  may be released (i.e. deleted).

    Messages that are for the NULL reference (i.e. that contain zero (0)
  in the LCI) are always sent on SCTP stream zero (0).  Messages with a
  non-zero LCI are always sent on an SCTP stream other than zero (0),
  unless stream zero (0) is the only available outbound stream because
  the maximum number of outbound streams negotiated on association
  initialization is one (1), or the message is an INTERRUPT or INTERRUPT
  CONFIRM message.  When the message is an INTERRUPT or INTERRUPT
  CONFIRM message, the XOS layer should select a stream id not used by
  other messages, or may transmit the message on stream zero (0).

    Note: X.25 expects that the flow control restrictions appropriate
  for expedited data and normal data, for example, CONS mapped onto X.25
  in accordance with X.233 [X.233], provide that the expedited data be
  subject to different flow control restrictions than is normal data.
  This can be accomplished in SCTP in several ways:

   (1)   The packets can be sent with the unordered flag set: meaning
         that INTERRUPT and INTERRUPT CONFIRM packets are permitted to
         be delivered to the peer user, even when some other packets are
         missing and ordered packets can not currently be delivered.

   (2)   The packets can be sent in a separate stream from the stream in
         which normal data is delivered.

    One or both of these procedures can be applied at the same time.



B. Bidulock                    Version 0.0                       Page 13

Internet Draft            X.25 over SCTP (XOS)               May 1, 2009

    Once the mapping has been performed for a particular message, the
  message is issued to the SCTP layer with SEND primitive (see RFC 4960,
  Section 10) the indexed "stream id," the "unordered flag" clear for
  all non-zero LCI messages with the exception of INTERRUPT and
  INTERRUPT CONFIRM packets.

5.2.  Reception of XOS Packets

    Upon receiving data from the SCTP Association using the RECEIVE
  primitive (see RFC 4960, Section 10), the XOS layer examines the
  contained X.25 message, extracts the LCI and delivers the message to
  the indicated X.25 PLP DXE as normal (that is, using the DL-DATA
  Indication service primitive) [X.212].  The X.25 PLP processes this
  data no differently that if it were received from LAPB [ISO/IEC 8208],
  [ISO 7776], [X.222] or LLC2 [ISO 8881], [802.2].

6.  XOS Procedures

    XOS procedures are modeled after the procedures of the LAPB Data
  Link [ISO 7776], [X.222].  X.25 PLP procedures are the same as
  expounded in X.25 and ISO 8208 and are not altered by this memo,
  except where noted.

6.1.  SCTP Association Setup and Clearing

    For XOS, each SCTP Association corresponds to a data link.
  Therefore, the SCTP Association follows the same rules for
  establishment and closing that the LAPB or LLC2 data link exhibits.
  When the X.25-PLP layer requests that a data link be established, the
  SCTP-INITIALIZE and SCTP-ASSOCIATE procedures are invoked as described
  under "DL-CONNECT," above.  When the X.25-PLP layer or XOS determines
  that the data link is no longer in use (by virtual circuits), the
  X.25-PLP requests that the data link be closed with a DL-DISCONNECT
  Request primitive that results in the SCTP-ABORT or SCTP-SHUTDOWN
  operation as described under "DL-DISCONNECT," above.

6.2.  Virtual Circuit Setup and Clearing

    Once an SCTP association has been established, the restart
  procedures described in ISO/IEC 8208 [ISO/IEC 8208] section 4.5
  (Determining "DTE" or "DCE" characteristics), are used to determine
  whether the local DTE acts in DTE or DCE mode for the purpose of
  logical channel number assignment.  This is accomplished using the
  restart procedure described in that section.  This does not preclude
  and is compatible with a given SCTP peer acting in DCE-only mode (i.e.
  as a data link entity associated with a private or public packet
  switched data network).

    When establishing virtual and permanent virtual circuits, the normal
  ITU-T Recommendation X.25 or ISO/IEC 8208 procedures as regards LCI
  are used by the X.25 PLP layer associated with the XOS peers.  Normal
  message formats and state transitions are used.


B. Bidulock                    Version 0.0                       Page 14

Internet Draft            X.25 over SCTP (XOS)               May 1, 2009

    To simplify end-to-end flow control, the packet size and window size
  SHOULD always be explicitly sent as facilities in the Call packet, in
  the fashion of ISO 8208.  When included in the Call packet, the packet
  MUST contain both Packet Size and Window Size facilities.  The Call
  Confirm packet MAY contain these facilities.  The handling of a Call
  received over an SCTP association that does not encode one or both of
  the flow control facilities is a local matter--if the XOS accepts such
  a call, it MUST encode the missing flow control facility values that
  apply to the connection in the returned Call Confirm packet.

    Note that the X.25 interface normally have a concept of network
  default values for packet size and window size.  It was thought that
  when connecting diverse sites over an SCTP/IP network this concept
  would be difficult to achieve in practise.  If there is no network
  default, then each call must state the packet size and window size.
  This is the reason for requiring the packet size and window size
  facilities.  It is expected that this can be achieved either by the
  XOS layer itself, or by configuring the X.25 engine such that there is
  no network default on the interface.

    After receiving or sending a Clear Confirm packet for the last
  virtual circuit supported by an SCTP association, the SCTP association
  MAY be closed, in accordance with the same procedures for data links
  as described in ITU-T Recommendation X.25 [X.25] and ISO/IEC 8208
  [ISO/IEC 8208].

    A packet with an invalid X.25 Packet Type Identifier (PTI) received
  over the SCTP connection before a Call has been received (i.e., while
  in the P1 state) MUST be silently discarded.

6.3.  Interrupt, and Reset Packets

    Interrupt, Interrupt Confirm, Reset and Reset Confirm packets are
  sent over the SCTP association using normal X.25 packet formats and
  state transitions.

    Reset and Reset Confirm packets are sent with the same SCTP stream
  id as other data packets associated with the VC or PVC by Local
  Channel Identifier.

    Interrupt and Interrupt Confirm packets, on the other hand, are used
  to implement network expedited data and SHOULD be sent either with an
  SCTP stream id separate from any normal data stream, or on stream id
  zero (0).  Also, Interrupt and Interrupt Confirm packets MAY be sent
  unordered (i.e., with the U bit set ni the SCTP Data Chunk Header).

6.4.  Restart, DTE Reject, Diagnostics, and Registration

    X.25 packets that have only a local DTE/DXE interface significance
  (Restart, Restart Confirm, DTE Reject, Diagnostic, Registration
  Request and Registration Confirmation) MUST be sent over the SCTP
  outbound stream zero (0), and MAY be sent unordered (i.e. with the U
  bit set in the SCTP Data Chunk Header).

7.  Reason Codes

    This section describes the mapping of specific SCTP error conditions
  to Data Link Service Definition reset reasons and disconnect reasons.

7.1.  Connection Rejection Reasons

    As a result of receiving a DL-CONNECT Request from the X.25 PLP, XOS
  issues an SCTP-INITIALIZE and SCTP-ASSOCIATE primitive to SCTP.  When
  the formation of an SCTP associations fails, SCTP may indicate an
  error to XOS.  This error indication can either be as a result of an
  SCTP error, or an ICMP error.  XOS indicates this connection rejection
  to X.25 PLP using the DL-DISCONNECT Indication service primitive.

    The DL-DISCONNECT Indication primitive, when used for connection
  rejection, contains a reason parameter that indicates the reason for
  connection rejection.  The connection rejection reason may be one of
  the following:

   + Connection Rejection -- Destination Unknown
   + Connection Rejection -- Destination Unreachable (Permanent)
   + Connection Rejection -- Destination Unreachable (Transient)
   + Connection Rejection -- QOS Unavailable (Permanent)
   + Connection Rejection -- QOS Unavailable (Transient)
   + Connection Rejection -- Permanent Condition (Permanent)
   + Connection Rejection -- Transient Condition (Transient)
   + Connection Rejection -- Unspecified

  The RECOMMENDED mapping of SCTP and ICMP error codes to Connection
  Rejection reasons is listed in Table 4.

7.2.  Disconnect Reasons

    Once the data link is in the data transfer state and the SCTP
  association fails, SCTP may indicate an error to XOS.  This error
  indication can either be as a result of an SCTP error, or an ICMP
  error.  XOS indicates this disconnect to X.25 PLP using the DL-
  DISCONNECT Indication primitive.

    The DL-DISCONNECT Indication primitive, when used for disconnection,
  contains a reason parameter that indicates the reason for
  disconnection.  The disconnection reason may be one of the following:

   + Disconnect -- Permanent Condition
   + Disconnect -- Transient Condition
   + Disconnect -- Abnormal Condition
   + Disconnect -- Normal Condition
   + Disconnect -- Unspecified

  The RECOMMENDED mapping of SCTP and ICMP error codes to Disconnect
  reasons is listed in Table 5.

7.3.  Reset Reasons

    Once the data link is in the data transfer state and the SCTP
  association restarts, SCTP may indicate an error to XOS.  This error
  indication can either be as a result of an SCTP error, or an ICMP
  error.  XOS indicates this reset to X.25 PLP using the DL-RESET
  Indication service primitive.

    The DL-RESET Indication primitive, when used for reset, contains a
  reason parameter that indicates the reason for reset.  The reset
  reason may be one of the following:

   + Reset -- Flow Control
   + Reset -- Link Error
   + Reset -- User Resynchronization
   + Reset -- Unspecified

  The RECOMMENDED mapping of SCTP and ICMP error codes to Reset reasons
  is listed in Table 6.

Notes for Section 7

  <1>  Note that SCTP does not provide a source of an SCTP restart
       indication.  The source could be either the peer SCTP provider
       or the peer SCTP User.  Therfore, the origin is considered to
       be undefined.

8.  Quality of Service

    The Data Link Service Definition [X.212] states:

      There are three QOS parameters: throughput, protection, and
      priority ..., which are of the type that may be selected
      during DLC establishment.  ...  Once the DLC is estblished,
      throughout the lifetime of the DLC, the agreed QOS values are
      not reselected at any point, and there is no guarantee that
      the original values will be maintained.  The DLS users should
      also be aware that changes in QOS on a DLC as not explicitly
      signalled by the DLS provider [X.212].


    X.25 LAPB [X.25], ISO Data Link Protocol [ISO 7776], [X.222], and
  LLC [802.2], all provide for Quality of Service parameters to be
  determined at the time of establishment of the data link.  XOT
  [RFC1613] (and TCP beneath it) provides no mechanism for Quality of
  Service.  For XOS, on the other hand, SCTP provides several mechanisms
  to enforce grade of service on an association, as follows:

   (1)   SCTP protocol parameters provide for the maximum number of path
         retransmissions, and maximum number of association
         retransmissions, as well as the maximum retransmission timeout.
         These parameters can be adjusted to accommodate the maximum
         transit delay.

   (2)   The SCTP protocol provides for a maximum lifetime before
         acknowledgement of data messages submitted for transmission.
         The lifetime can be affected on an association basis or a per-
         message basis.  This protocol mechanism can also be adjusted to
         accommodate maximum transit delay.

   (3)   The SCTP protocol extension for Partial Reliability can be used
         to adjust the residual error rate for the SCTP association.

    Another approach to the management of QOS in the IP network surfaced
  after the advent of XOT [RFC1613] as the protocol RSVP [].  With RSVP,
  (the procedures of which are also applicable to XOT), a reservation is
  performed against an RSVP server responsible for admission control of
  SCTP flows for the attached networks.  The RSVP reservation would be
  made by XOS prior to the establishment of the SCTP association to
  which the QOS applies.

Internet Draft            X.25 over SCTP (XOS)               May 1, 2009

    The following QOS parameters may be supported:

  Throughput:-
       This is a per-connection value.

  Transit Delay:-

  Residual Error Rate:-
       For SCTP, unless the Partial Reliability extension to SCTP is
       used, the residual error rate will always be zero (0).<1>

  Resilience:-

  Protection:-
       This is a per-connection value.  The protection supported by the
       SCTP association is a matter for the DLS Provider to determine.
       When IPSec or TLS is used, the protection value can include
       passive monitoring and active attacks.  Whether all three values
       of protection are available when IPSec or TLS is not may depend
       upon the network providing the SCTP association.

  Priority:-
       This is a per-connection value.  The priority supported by the
       SCTP association is a matter for the DLS Provider to determine.

Notes for Section 8

  <1>  Note that without the Partial Reliability extention, SCTP is
       always a reliable transport service and the association will
       fail if SCTP is unable to transport packets to the peer and
       deliver them in order or out of order within a reasonable (and
       configurable) time period.  This is referred to in the IETF as
       a "reliable" transport.

9.  Security

    As with ISO 8208 and ITU-T Rec. X.25 applications, security is not
  integrated at the data link and network level, but rather, is
  integrated at layers above the transport layer.  Therefore, XOS has no
  more Security exposure issues that X.25 itself.

    On the other hand, by transporting X.25 PLP packets over SCTP over a
  public internet, their contents are exposed to a much greater degree
  than if they were transport over a private line service using ISO
  8208.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the SCTP implementation used
  on public internets be capable of operating with IPSec or TLS to
  protect the payload of the SCTP transport, in this case, the X.25 PLP
  packets, to at least reduce exposure to the levels of private line
  service.

10.  IANA Considerations

    The following IANA considerations are made:

10.1.  SCTP Payload Protocol ID

    This memo assigns an XOS value for the Payload Protocol Identifier
  in the SCTP DATA chunk.  The following SCTP Payload Protocol
  Identifier will be registered: XOS "YY"

    The SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier value "YY"<1> SHOULD be
  included in each SCTP DATA chunk, to indicates that the SCTP is
  carrying the XOS protocol.  The value zero "0" (unspecified) is also
  allows but any other values MUST NOT be used. This Payload Protocol
  Identifier is not directly used by SCTP but MAY bse used by certain
  network entities to identify the type of information carried in the
  DATA chunk.

    The User Adaptation peer MAY use the Payload Protocol Identifier as
  a way of determining additional information about the data being
  presented to it by SCTP.  A request will be made to IANA to assign
  SCTP Payload Protocol IDs.

10.2.  SCTP Port Number

    IANA has registered TCP Port Number "1998"<2> for XOT [RFC1613].  It
  is recommended that XOS hosts use this TCP port number also for SCTP
  for listening for new connections.  XOS hosts MAY also use statically
  configured SCTP port numbers instead.

Notes for Section 10

  <1>  EDITOR'S NOTE:- The value shown as "YY" is to be assigned by
       IANA and may change in future versions of this document.

  <2>  EDITOR'S NOTE:- The value shown as "1998" is to be assigned by
       IANA and may change in future versions of this document.
