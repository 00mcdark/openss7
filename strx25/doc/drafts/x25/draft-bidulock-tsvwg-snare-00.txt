Abstract

    This memo provides a mechanism for providing for a SNARE [ISO/IEC
  10030], [X.223] capability over UDP for providing a subnetwork address
  resolution entity that can provide X.25 CONS address discovery for the
  XOT [RFC1613] and XOS protocols.

Contents

    A complete table of contents, list of illustrations, list of tables
  and change history for this memo appears at the end of the memo.

Internet Draft         SNARE over UDP (SNARE-UDP)            May 7, 2008

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Scope

1.2.  Terminology

    This memo uses the following extended terminology:

  Subnetwork Address Resolution Entity (SNARE) -- A subnetwork address
      resolution entity is an entity that can provide address routing
      configuration and redirect information in accordance with the ISO
      CONS SNARE definintion [ISO/IEC 10030].

1.3.  Abbreviations

      CONS    -- Connection Oriented Network Service
      ES      -- End System
      IS      -- Intermediate System
      OSI     -- Open Systems Interconnect
      SNARE   -- Subnetwork Address Resolution Entity


1.4.  Conventions

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Security

3.  IANA Considerations

    This memo requests the assignment of one UDP well-known port number
  and two IP Multicast Addresses.

3.1.  IPv4 Multicast Addresses

    Two IP multicast addresses are to be assigned for this protocol:

  All CONS End System Address
      This address is used for sending multicast UDP datagrams to all
      CONS end systems on an IP subnetwork.

  All CONS SNARES Address
      This address is used for sending multicast UDP datagrams to all
      CONS SNAREs on an IP subnetwork.

3.2.  Port Number

    This memo allocates a well-known port number for use in listening
  for UDP datagrams on multicast addresses and for exchanging SNARE
  messages between a CONS End System and a SNARE Intermediate System.
