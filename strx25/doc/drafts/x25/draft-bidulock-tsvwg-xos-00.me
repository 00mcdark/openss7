.pp
This document is a revision to RFC 1613
.[
xot
%Z 1
.]
written by James R. Forster, Greg Satz, Gilbert Glick and Bob Day.  Since the
release of RFC 1613 in May 1994, a new IP transport protocol, Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP),
.[
rfc4960
%Z 1
.]
has been released as a Proposed Standard that provides superior services to
TCP in some respects, particularly related to OSI or Signalling protocols.
.pp
This memo describes the mechanism to allow X.25-PLP to run directly over
SCTP over IPv4 or IPv6.  It also defines a number of new features that were not
provided in RFC 1613, but are now possible due to the superior capabilities
provided by SCTP.
.pp
The goal of this version is to minimize the number of changes to RFC 1613 as
well as ITU-T Rec. X.25
.[
x25
%Z 1
.]
or ISO/IEC 8208
.[
iso/iec 8208 : 2000
%Z 1
.]
while maximizing performance, extending its applicability and protecting the
installed base of RFC 1613 users.
.\"
.\"
.sh 1 Introduction
.pp
It is sometimes desirable to transport X.25 over IP internets.  The X.25
Packet Level requires a reliable link level below it and normally uses LAPB
.[
iso 7776
%Z 2
.]
.[
x222
%Z 2
.]
or LLC2.
.[
iso 8802-2 : 1998
%Z 2
.]
XOT
.[
xot
.]
describes a method for using a TCP/IP connection as a data link over which
X.25 PLP (Packet Layer Protocol)
.[
iso/iec 8208 : 2000
.]
packets can be sent.
This memo documents a method of sending X.25 PLP packets over IP internets by
encapsulating the X.25 Packet Level in SCTP
.[
rfc4960
.]
packets.
.pp
SCTP provides a set of reliable sequenced or un-sequenced packets in
independent streams.  X.25 requires that the layer beneath it provide message
semantics, in particular the boundary between packets.
SCTP preserves message boundaries and with no need for additional headers.
Also, the SCTP PPI field provides a way
to identify the version of the protocol.
.pp
In contrast, the TCP approach with XOT
.[
xot
.]
does not preserve message boundaries directly, and requires a header field,
both to preserve message boundaries as well as to provide a protocol version
number.
.pp
In general, the normal X.25 protocol packet formats and state transition rules
apply to the X.25 layer in XOS.  Exceptions to this are noted.
.\"
.\"
.sh 2 Scope
.sh 3 "Advantages of XOS over XOT"
.pp
\fB\)XOS\fP has a number of unique advantages over XOT,
.[
xot
.]
as itemized below:
.np
SCTP preserves message boundaries without additional protocol elements (such as
the header required by TCP in XOT to recover record boundaries).
.np
SCTP can identify the transported protocol using the Payload Protocol
Identifier.
.np
SCTP provides a heartbeat mechanism that detects failure faster than TCP is
able.  Thus, SCTP associations can be established and left idle awaiting call
setups.  This, again permits faster call setup.
.np
SCTP detects lost associations and has a quick restart procedure for
reestablishing them.  TCP can take minutes to reestablish a connection and
when confronted with reestablishing 4095 connections, temporary network
conditions can be disastrous.
.np
SCTP provides a measure of the quality of service experienced by the SCTP
association (smoothed round trip time) that can be used to support X.25 and
CONS quality of service parameters and data link resource allocations.
.np
\fB\)XOS\fP only requires one association for per data link and utilizes
streams within the SCTP association to provide for independence of flow for
individual virtual channels.  XOT, on the other hand, requires one TCP
connection per virtual channel.  Therefore, \fB\)XOS\fP uses less resources
per virtual channel and scales better.  Also, \fB\)XOS\fP avoids the
additional call setup delay associated with establishing a TCP connection.
.pp
These and the additional capabilities of SCTP make \fB\)XOS\fP a superior
replacement to XOT.
.\"
.\"
.sh 3 "Relationship of XOS to XOT"
.pp
The XOS protocol described in this memo is not intended as a replacement for
XOT,
.[
xot
.]
but XOS is intended, where available, as a superior alternative to XOT.
.pp
The XOT specification,
.[
xot
.]
was used as a template for the initial drafts of this memo.  However,
RFC 1613 provides sections that are not applicable to XOS, as follows:
.np
The XOT specification,
.[
xot
.]
went to some length to describe the interactions between an XOT interface and
an X.25 interface on a given host to provide an network relay function.  This
function, however, has since been standardized as
ISO/IEC 10028
.[
iso 10028
%Z 2
.]
and ISO/IEC 10177,
.[
iso 10177
%Z 2
.]
and, therefore, does not need to be discussed here.  Also, because the X.25
PLP and CONS relay function is a purely nodal function, it has no impact on
protocol design.
.sp
Those sections of the XOT
specification that spoke to network layer relays and interworking units have
been removed from XOS.
The procedures of ISO
10177
.[
iso 10028
.]
.[
iso 10177
.]
are as applicable to XOS as they are to LAPB

and the reader is referred to those documents.

.np
The XOT specification went to some trouble to remove the distinction between
DTE, DCE and DXE as provided for in X.25 and ISO 8208.  This was possible
because the TCP connection only supported one anonymous virtual channel and
Logical Channel Identifier assignment became trivial.  Unfortunately, this
resulted in modifications to the X.25 engine: removal of the distinction
between DTE, DCE and DXE, and the removal of the restart procedures and all
messages sent to the null reference.
.sp
\fB\)XOS\fP reinstates the traditional role of DTE, DCE and DXE as described
in X.25 and ISO 8208 and provides for the restart procedure and other
procedures on the null reference.  \fB\)XOS\fP in this way provides an
identical service interface to that of the LAPB or LLC2 data links and does
not require any X.25 PLP protocol or procedural modifications whatsoever.
Therefore, the passages on the loss of distinction between the role of DTE,
DCE and DXE, and the loss of the restart and LCI assignment procedures from
the X.25 PLP have been removed.
.np
The XOT specification, because only one virtual channel was supported per TCP
connection, and because the LCI assignment procedures were removed, had to
specify a non-standard message for use in specifying or establishing Permanent
Virtual Circuits.  This again required modifications to the X.25 PLP protocol
and procedures to support PVCs on XOT.
.sp
\fB\)XOS\fP reinstates the normal static assignment of LCI for PVCs and does
not require additional non-standard messages to support PVCs.  PVC Setup is,
once again, a matter for management systems and the corresponding section from
RFC 1613, "PVC Setup", has been removed from this Memo.

When a networking device (a host, router, etc.) has an X.25 engine (i.e.,
an X.25 PLP
.[

.]
protocol implementation), that engine may be connected to interface(s) running

XOT/TCP/IP
.[

.]
or XOS/SCTP/IP.
In general, the XOS layer itself is not at all sensitive to what kind of
packets the X.25 engine passes to it.  However, to improve interoperability
between separate implementations, this document in some cases does specify
behaviour for the X.25 engine.
.pp
While this document primarily discusses XOS from the perspective of providing
X.25 connectivity using XOS, this should not prevent a host from switching
X.25 traffic (i.e, connecting an X.25 Virtual Circuit between the local X.25
interfaces of two networking devices).  In general, the X.25 PLP is unaware
that the data link services are being provided by XOS/SCTP/IP and therefore
the standards applicable to network internal layer services
.[
iso 10028
.]
and network layer relay and protocol interworking
.[
iso 10177
.]
are as applicable to X.25 PLP using XOS and LAPB as they are to X.25 PLP using
LLC2 and LAPB.
.\".pp
.\"The various X.25 standards may call a given packet type by a different name
.\"according to the assigned DTE/DCE role of the interface that originated the
.\"packet.  XOS is intended to be insensitive to the DTE/DCE role of the local

RFC convention is that a packet format is represented graphically with the

Each Virtual Circuit (VC) relating to the same Data Link, however, is carried

Registered Port Number registered by cisco Systems; cisco has designated it
for use by XOT for TCP.  This memo recommends the use of the same port number,
1998, for use by XOS for SCTP.  See Section 9, \(lq\fIIANA Considerations\fP
for more information on port number.

Identifier (LCI) for X.25 LAPB.  The Logical Channel Identifier (LCI) field in
the X.25 header maps to the SCTP stream upon which the message is sent.
.pp
X.25 and ISO 8208 support the assignment of virtual circuits (VC) and
permanent virtual circuits (PVC) to logical channel identifiers in the range
from 1-4095 inclusive.  Logical channel identifier zero (0) is reserved for
data link related messages (e.g., RESTART REQUEST).  SCTP provides support for
multiple quasi-independent streams of sequenced data records and can negotiate
the number of outbound streams (between 1 and 65536) during association
establishment.  In general, streams in SCTP are used to establish an ordered
relationship between packets (all packets transmitted on the same stream with
sequenced delivery will be delivered in order), and the stream identifier is
not intended to be used to identifying virtual circuits of any kind.  For
example, there is no requirement on SCTP peers to negotiation the same number
of inbound streams as the number of outbound streams; and, there is no
requirement to deliver the stream identifier as part of the information
associated with received data.
.pp
Therefore, the mapping between LCI and SCTP stream number is not an identity
relationship (for all but LCI zero (0)).  Once a virtual circuit is assigned
to an outbound SCTP stream, however, it \fB\)SHOULD\fP remain assigned to that
stream for the lifetime of the connection, otherwise, ordered message
sequencing will be at risk on the VC.  The XOS layer should provide the
ability to distribute active VCs over the available outbound streams in as
efficient a manner as possible, however, the precise algorithm for doing so is
a local matter.  One way of accomplishing this is, indeed, by negotiating 4096
outbound streams with the SCTP peer and providing an identity mapping between
LCI and SCTP stream number; however, this is not the only (nor most efficient)
arrangement possible.
.pp
Logical Channel Identifier zero (0), that is the "NULL" virtual circuit,
refers to the data link and all contained VC and PVC, and is special in that
messages sent on this LCI \fB\)MUST\fP be sent on SCTP stream number zero (0).
Messages sent on LCI zero (0) (and SCTP stream zero (0)) \fB\)MAY\fP be sent
unordered.  No other messages (i.e. messages for LCI other than zero (0)) will
be sent on SCTP stream zero (0), unless there is only one outbound stream
negotiated (in which case all messages must be sent on stream zero (0)).
Which of the other available outbound streams is used for a particular LCI is
a local matter; therefore, an XOS receiver \fB\)MUST NOT\fP use the inbound
SCTP stream number to discriminate virtual circuits, but \fB\)MUST\fP use the
LCI contained in the X.25 header (as is the case for normal X.25 and ISO 8208
operation).

address in the SCTP-ASSOCIATE primitive.  The priority parameter from the
DL-CONNECT Request is ignored.  Once the SCTP ASSOCIATION has formed, XOS will
issue a DL-CONNECT Confirm primitive to the X.25 PLP with the source address

Upon receipt of a DL-RESET Request primitive from the X.25 PLP, XOS will issue
an SCTP-ABORT primitive to SCTP followed immediately by an SCTP-ASSOCIATE

.[
iso 8802-2 : 1998
.]
The X.25 PLP (DXE) is responsible for resolving LCI assignment conflicts and
completing the LCI field of the X.25 header for packets.  The packets are then
delivered to the XOS layer using the DL-DATA Request primitive.  The XOS layer
may examine the packet for the content of the LCI assignment, and uses a
table to map the LCI from the X.25 header in the message to an SCTP stream
number.  When the packet is a CC packet establishing a connection, the entry
in the mapping table for LCI to SCTP stream is first populated.  Once a DC is
packet is received, the associated entry in the mapping table for the released
virtual circuit may be released (i.e. deleted).
.pp
Messages that are for the NULL reference (i.e. that contain zero (0) in the
LCI) are always sent on SCTP stream zero (0).  Messages with a non-zero LCI
are always sent on an SCTP stream other than zero (0), unless stream zero (0)
is the only available outbound stream because the maximum number of outbound
streams negotiated on association initialization is one (1), or the message is
an INTERRUPT or INTERRUPT CONFIRM message.  When the message is an INTERRUPT
or INTERRUPT CONFIRM message, the XOS layer should select a stream id not used
by other messages, or may transmit the message on stream zero (0).
.pp
.b Note:
X.25 expects that the flow control restrictions appropriate for expedited data
and normal data, for example, CONS mapped onto X.25 in accordance with
X.233,
.[
x233
%Z 2
.]
provide that the expedited data be subject to different flow control
restrictions than is normal data. This can be accomplished in SCTP in several
ways:
.np
The packets can be sent with the unordered flag set: meaning that INTERRUPT
and INTERRUPT CONFIRM packets are permitted to be delivered to the peer user,
even when some other packets are missing and ordered packets can not currently
be delivered.
.np
The packets can be sent in a separate stream from the stream in which normal
data is delivered.
.pp
One or both of these procedures can be applied at the same time.
.pp
Once the mapping has been performed for a particular message, the message is
issued to the SCTP layer with SEND primitive (see RFC 4960, Section 10) the
indexed "stream id," the "unordered flag" clear for all non-zero LCI messages
with the exception of INTERRUPT and INTERRUPT CONFIRM packets.
.\"
.sh 2 "Reception of XOS Packets"
.pp
Upon receiving data from the SCTP Association using the RECEIVE primitive (see
RFC 4960, Section 10), the XOS layer examines the contained X.25 message,
extracts the LCI and delivers the message to the indicated X.25 PLP DXE as
normal (that is, using the DL-DATA Indication service primitive).

.sh 2 "SCTP Association Setup and Clearing"
.pp
For \fB\)XOS\fP, each SCTP Association corresponds to a data link.  Therefore,
the SCTP Association follows the same rules for establishment and closing that
the LAPB or LLC2 data link exhibits.  When the X.25-PLP layer requests that a
data link be established, the SCTP-INITIALIZE and SCTP-ASSOCIATE procedures
are invoked as described under \(lq\fIDL-CONNECT\fP,\(rq above.  When the
X.25-PLP layer or \fB\)XOS\fP determines that the data link is no longer in
use (by virtual circuits), the X.25-PLP requests that the data link be closed
with a DL-DISCONNECT Request primitive that results in the SCTP-ABORT or
SCTP-SHUTDOWN operation as described under \(lq\fIDL-DISCONNECT\fP,\(rq above.
.\"
.sh 2 "Virtual Circuit Setup and Clearing"
.pp
Once an SCTP association has been established, the restart procedures
described in ISO/IEC 8208
.[
iso/iec 8208 : 2000
.]
section 4.5 (Determining "DTE" or "DCE" characteristics), are used to
determine whether the local DTE acts in DTE or DCE mode for the purpose of
logical channel number assignment.  This is accomplished using the restart
procedure described in that section.  This does not preclude and is compatible
with a given SCTP peer acting in DCE-only mode (i.e. as a data link entity
associated with a private or public packet switched data network).
.pp
When establishing virtual and permanent virtual circuits, the normal ITU-T
Recommendation X.25 or ISO/IEC 8208 procedures as regards LCI are used by the
X.25 PLP layer associated with the XOS peers.  Normal message formats and
state transitions are used.

Note that the X.25 interface normally have a concept of network default values
for packet size and window size.  It was thought that when connecting diverse
sites over an SCTP/IP network this concept would be difficult to achieve in
practise.  If there is no network default, then each call must state the
packet size and window size.  This is the reason for requiring the packet size
and window size facilities.  It is expected that this can be achieved either
by the XOS layer itself, or by configuring the X.25 engine such that there is
no network default on the interface.

.sh 2 "Disconnect Reasons"
.pp
Once the data link is in the data transfer state and the SCTP association
fails, SCTP may indicate an error to XOS.  This error indication can either be
as a result of an SCTP error, or an ICMP error.  XOS indicates this disconnect
to X.25 PLP using the DL-DISCONNECT Indication primitive.
.pp
The DL-DISCONNECT Indication primitive, when used for disconnection, contains
a reason parameter that indicates the reason for disconnection.  The
disconnection reason may be one of the following:
.bu
Disconnect \(em Permanent Condition\" (P)
.bu
Disconnect \(em Transient Condition\" (P)
.bu
Disconnect \(em Abnormal Condition\" (U)
.bu
Disconnect \(em Normal Condition\" (U)

Once the data link is in the data transfer state and the SCTP association
restarts, SCTP may indicate an error to XOS.  This error indication can either
be as a result of an SCTP error, or an ICMP error.  XOS indicates this reset
to X.25 PLP using the DL-RESET Indication service primitive.

.sh 1 "Quality of Service"
.pp
The Data Link Service Definition
.[
x212
.]
states:
.(q
There are three QOS parameters: throughput, protection, and priority ...,
which are of the type that may be selected during DLC establishment.  ...
Once the DLC is estblished, throughout the lifetime of the DLC, the agreed QOS
values are not reselected at any point, and there is no guarantee that the
original values will be maintained.  The DLS users should also be aware that
changes in QOS on a DLC as not explicitly signalled by the DLS
provider.
.[
x212
.]
.)q
.pp
X.25 LAPB,
.[

.]
ISO Data Link Protocol,
.[
iso 7776
.]
.[
x222
.]
and LLC,
.[
iso 8802-2 : 1998
.]
all provide for Quality of Service parameters to be determined at the time of
establishment of the data link.  XOT
.[
xot
.]
(and TCP beneath it) provides no mechanism for Quality of Service.
For XOS, on the other hand, SCTP provides several mechanisms to enforce grade
of service on an association, as follows:
.np
SCTP protocol parameters provide for the maximum number of path
retransmissions, and maximum number of association retransmissions, as well as
the maximum retransmission timeout. These parameters can be adjusted to
accommodate the maximum transit delay.
.np
The SCTP protocol provides for a maximum lifetime before acknowledgement of
data messages submitted for transmission.  The lifetime can be affected on an
association basis or a per-message basis.  This protocol mechanism can also be
adjusted to accommodate maximum transit delay.
.np
The SCTP protocol extension for Partial Reliability can be used to adjust the
residual error rate for the SCTP association.
.pp
Another approach to the management of QOS in the IP network surfaced after the
advent of XOT
.[
xot
.]
as the protocol RSVP.
.[
rsvp
.]
With RSVP, (the procedures of which are also applicable to XOT), a reservation
is performed against an RSVP server responsible for admission control of SCTP
flows for the attached networks.  The RSVP reservation would be made by XOS
prior to the establishment of the SCTP association to which the QOS applies.
.pp
The following QOS parameters may be supported:
.ip "\fB\)Throughput:\(en\fP"
This is a per-connection value.
.ip "\fB\)Transit Delay:\(en\fP"
.ip "\fB\)Residual Error Rate:\(en\fP"
For SCTP, unless the Partial Reliability extension to SCTP is used, the
residual error rate will always be zero (0).\*#
.(d
.#v
.ip \*#
Note that without the Partial Reliability extention, SCTP is always a reliable
transport service and the association will fail if SCTP is unable to transport
packets to the peer and deliver them in order or out of order within a
reasonable (and configurable) time period.  This is referred to in the IETF as
a "reliable" transport.
.)d
.ip "\fB\)Resilience:\(en\fP"
.ip "\fB\)Protection:\(en\fP"
This is a per-connection value.
The protection supported by the SCTP association is a matter for the DLS
Provider to determine.  When IPSec or TLS is used, the protection value can
include passive monitoring and active attacks.  Whether all three values of
protection are available when IPSec or TLS is not may depend upon the network
providing the SCTP association.
.ip "\fB\)Priority:\(en\fP"
This is a per-connection value.
The priority supported by the SCTP association is a matter for the DLS
Provider to determine.

.sh 1 Security
.pp
As with ISO 8208 and ITU-T Rec. X.25 applications, security is not integrated
at the data link and network level, but rather, is integrated at layers above
the transport layer.  Therefore, XOS has no more Security exposure issues that
X.25 itself.
.pp
On the other hand, by transporting X.25 PLP packets over SCTP over a public
internet, their contents are exposed to a much greater degree than if they
were transport over a private line service using ISO 8208.  It is therefore
\fB\)RECOMMENDED\fP that the SCTP implementation used on public internets be
capable of operating with IPSec or TLS to protect the payload of the SCTP
transport, in this case, the X.25 PLP packets, to at least reduce exposure to
the levels of private line service.

.sh 1 "IANA Considerations"
.pp
The following IANA considerations are made:
.sh 2 "SCTP Payload Protocol ID"
.pp
This memo assigns an XOS value for the Payload Protocol Identifier in the SCTP
DATA chunk.  The following SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier will be
registered:
.ba +12n
.ll -12n
XOS "YY"
.ba -12n
.ll +12n
.pp
The SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier value "YY"\*# \fB\)SHOULD\fP be included in each
SCTP DATA chunk, to indicates that the SCTP is carrying the XOS protocol.  The
value zero "0" (unspecified) is also allows but any other values \fB\)MUST
NOT\fP be
used. This Payload Protocol Identifier is not directly used by SCTP but
\fB\)MAY\fP
bse used by certain network entities to identify the type of information
carried in the DATA chunk.
.(d
.#v
.ip \*#
\fB\)EDITOR'S NOTE:\(en\fR The value shown as "YY" is to be assigned by IANA
and may change in future versions of this document.
.)d
.pp
The User Adaptation peer \fB\)MAY\fP use the Payload Protocol Identifier as a way of
determining additional information about the data being presented to it by
SCTP.  A request will be made to IANA to assign SCTP Payload Protocol IDs.
.\"
.sh 2 "SCTP Port Number"
.pp
IANA has registered TCP Port Number "1998"\*# for XOT.
.[
xot

It is recommended that XOS hosts use this TCP port number also for SCTP for
listening for new connections.  XOS hosts \fB\)MAY\fP also use statically configured
SCTP port numbers instead.
