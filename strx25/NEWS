The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
`OpenSS7 X.25 Networking' package.

 Initial release strx25-0.9.2.1
-------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strx25' release.

This is the initial open source release of the `OpenSS7 X.25
Networking' package.  This release contains modules and drivers
formerly only available with Commercial releases of the `strss7'
package and which are only recently available as open source with the
release of this package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the ISO/OSI
components were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the ISO/OSI components previously part of the
`strss7' package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the release, or `Schedule',in
the manual, for information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is LAPB.
`lapb(4)' is a pushable "STREAMS" module that is pushed over a `cdi(4)'
HDLC channel to form an X.25 data link providing the Data Link Provider
Interface, `dlpi(7)'.  A complete test suite will be available in a
further release.

Subsequent releases in 4Q 2008 will include the additional full ISO/OSI
X.25< CONS, CLNS, and TP0 through TP4, drivers with conformance test
suites.
