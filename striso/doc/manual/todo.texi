@subsubheading Current Plan

This package was initially started to provide managment interfaces to platforms using the OpenSS7
protocol stacks (CMIP and CMOT interfaces) using SS7 GDMO and other GDMO.  It was considered pulling
some of the old @file{isode} package into this package to provide some GDMO facilities.

Since then, it was discovered that these ISO protocols are still very important to a number of
industries on Linux and Linux Fast-STREAMS.  These industries are the Aviation and Financial
industries.  Closer to the heard of telecommunications is the applications of aircraft to ground
communications for the Aviation industry.

While the OpenSS7 Project's focus over the Summer of 2007 is going to be soft-switch enabling
protocols, that may change if the Aviation industry steps up to this package with some funding to
complete the work or by contributing changes, improvements or development to this package.
Otherwise, expect this package to receive only maintenance releases over the next 8 months or so.

@subsubheading Things to Do

@itemize @minus
@item
Testing.  This package is completely untested.

@emph{*todo*}

@item
Create @manpage{isot(4)}, @manpage{itot(4)}, @manpage{lpp(4)} and
@manpage{cmot(4)} @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers.

@emph{*todo*}

@item
Move already written code from the @file{stacks} or @file{strss7} directories
into the @file{src} directory.

@emph{*todo*}

@item
Create a skeleton directory and manual and place @command{@value{PACKAGE}} as
a subpackage in the @cite{OpenSS7 Master Package}.

@table @emph
@item *done*
You are reading it.
@end table

@end itemize

The purpose of the package was to move @dfn{STREAMS} ISO networking capabilities outside of the
@file{strss7} release package.
The @command{@value{PACKAGE}} package is currently incomplete.
If you are interested in the completion of this add-on package, contact @email{info@@openss7.com}.
