@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This is the fifth separate @cite{OpenSS7 Project} release of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}
package.  The package contains modules and drivers formerly available with commercial relase of the
@file{strss7} package and which are only recently  available as open source.

With @cite{OpenSS7 Master Package} release @file{openss7-0.9.2.D}, the ISO/OSI components were
separated from the @file{strss7} package and placed in this package.  With release
@file{openss7-0.9.2.G}, the X.25 components were removed from this package and placed into the
@file{strx25} package.  With this release, all components have been strapped into the package and
validated with validation test suites.@footnote{Note that no component in this package can be
supported by @cite{LiS}.}  See
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/TODO,@file{TODO}} in the
release, or @refman{Schedule}, for more information about the release schedule.

This is a gamma release, and is part of the @cite{OpenSS7 Master Package}
(@file{openss7-@value{VERSION_OPENSS7}}).  It deprecates previous releases: please upgrade before
reporting bugs.

Major feature since the last public release are:

@end itemize

@emph{This is a gamma release of the package: it deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to
the current release before reporting bugs.}

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 @manref{rpm(8)} and @manref{dpkg(1)} based distributions, and
can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released strictly under the @cite{GNU Affero General Public License Version
3}; however, commercial licensing is available.  The release is available as an @manref{autoconf(1)}
tarball, SRPM, DSC, and a set of binary RPMs and DEBs for popular distributions.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss.org/@value{PACKAGE}_pkg.html,package page} for the @mantype{autoconf(1)}
tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/repos.html,repository page} for information concerning network
installation and update sources.

See @uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/ChangeLog,ChangeLog} and
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/NEWS,NEWS} in the release for
more information.  Also, see the @file{@value{PACKAGE}.pdf} manual in the release (also in
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/@value{PACKAGE}_manual.html,html}).

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.4
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.4
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.4

This is the fourth separate @cite{OpenSS7 Project} release of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}
package.
This release contains modules and drivers formerly only available with Commercial releases of the
@file{strss7} package and which are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release @file{openss7-0.9.2.D}, the ISO/OSI components were separated
from the @file{strss7} package and placed in this package.  Not all of the ISO/OSI components
previously part of the @file{strss7} package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} on a module-by-module and driver-by-driver
basis.@footnote{Note that no component in this package can be supported by @cite{LiS}: @cite{LiS} is
simply too slow to allow these drivers to acheive any degree of efficiency necessary for proper
operation.} See @file{TODO} in the release, or @refman{Schedule}, for more information about the
release schedule.

In this fourth release, the major component first available is LAPB.  @manpage{lapb(4)} is a
pushable @dfn{STREAMS} module that is pushed over a @manpage{cdi(4)} HDLC channel to form an X.25
data link providing the Data Link Provider Interface, @manpage{dlpi(7)}.  A complete test suite will
be available in a further release.

Subsequent releases in 4Q 2008 will include the additional full ISO/OSI CONS, CLNS, and TP0 through
TP4, drivers with conformance test suites.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

@itemize -
@item
Minor documentation corrections.

@item
Kernel module license made explicit "GPL v2".  And then changed back to "GPL".

@item
License upgrade to @cite{AGPL Version 3}.

@item
Modifications to build under @cite{Fedora} @samp{2.6.22.5-49} kernel.  These changes also support
@samp{2.6.22.9-91.fc7} kernel.

@item
Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation primarily for embedded targets.

@item
Improvements to common build process for embedded and cross-compile targets.

@item
Modifications to build under @cite{Fedora} @samp{2.6.25-45.fc9} and @samp{2.6.26.5-45.fc9} kernels.

@item
Updated tool chain to @file{m4-1.4.12}, @file{autoconf-2.63} and @file{texinfo-4.13}.

@item
Conversion of RPM spec files to common approach for major subpackages.

@item
Updated references database for manual pages and roff documents.

@item
Build system now builds @mantype{yum(8)} repositories for RPMs and @mantype{apt-get(8)} repositories
for DEBs.  Installation documentation has been updated to include details of repository install
sourcesref.

@item
Added @constant{MODULE_VERSION} to all modules and drivers.

package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only available

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1.rc3
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1.rc3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1.rc3

Third release candidate.

@itemize -
@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.  The @samp{make installcheck} target will now automatically
test both 64-bit native and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other,
on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Added versioning of all library symbols.

@item
Many documentation updates for all @uref{http://www.openss7.org/,, OpenSS7}
packages.  Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
timely text documentation present in the release directory.

@item
Dropped support for @cite{LiS}.

@item
Updated @command{init} scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

@item
Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number
230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package
will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6 kernels under
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} only.  @cite{@value{PACKAGE}} now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per
major device number on 2.6 kernels: @cite{LiS} cannot support this change.

@item
Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions:
support for additional @cite{SuSE} distributions on @code{ix86} as well as
@code{x86_64}.  Added distribution support includes @cite{SLES 9}, @cite{SLES 9
SP2}, @cite{SLES 9 SP3}, @cite{SLES 10}, @cite{SuSE 10.1}.

@item
Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent @command{gcc}
compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily
SUSE).

@item
Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition
to kernel programs.  Added new @option{--with-optimize} option to
@command{configure} to accomplish this.

@item
Added @command{--disable-devel} @command{configure} option to suppress building
and installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure
runtime targets that do not need the development environment (static libraries,
manual pages, documentation).

@item
Added @command{send-pr} script for automatic problem report generation.

@item
The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the 'doxy' make
target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the distribution for more
information.
