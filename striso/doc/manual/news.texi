@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This is the second open source release of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only available with
Commercial releases of the @file{strss7} package and which are only recently
available as open source with the release of this package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release @file{openss7-0.9.2.D}, the ISO/OSI
components were separated from the @file{strss7} package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the ISO/OSI components previously part of the @file{strss7}
package have been strapped into this release.  Components will be re-validated
against @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} on a module-by-module and driver-by-driver
basis.  See @file{TODO} in the release, or @refman{Schedule}, for information
about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is LAPB.
@manpage{lapb(4)} is a pushable @dfn{STREAMS} module that is pushed over a
@manpage{cdi(4)} HDLC channel to form an X.25 data link providing the Data Link
Provider Interface, @manpage{dlpi(7)}.  A complete test suite will be available
in a further release.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full ISO/OSI X.25<
CONS, CLNS, and TP0 through TP4, drivers with conformance test suites.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

@itemize -
@item
Updated to gettext 0.16.1.

@item
Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 kernel.

@item
Support for recent distribuations and tool chains.

Improvements to the common build environment with better support for standalone
package builds on 2.4 kernels.

@item
Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

separate tarball.

@end itemize
@ignore

@emph{This is a public alpha release of the package.  Please see
@file{README-alpha} in the release or @refman{Maturity}.}

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a reference point
for the community.  If you are interested in completion of this package, contact
@email{info@@openss7.com}.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and
builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the @cite{GNU General Public License
Version 2}.  The release is available as an @command{autoconf} tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html,downloads page} for the
@command{autoconf} tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and
binary RPMs and DEBs, see the

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1.rc3
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1.rc3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1.rc3

Third release candidate.

@itemize -
@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.  The @samp{make installcheck} target will now automatically
test both 64-bit native and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other,
on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Added versioning of all library symbols.

@item
Many documentation updates for all @uref{http://www.openss7.org/,, OpenSS7}
packages.  Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
timely text documentation present in the release directory.

@item
Dropped support for @cite{LiS}.

@item
Updated @command{init} scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

@item
Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number
230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package
will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6 kernels under
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} only.  @cite{@value{PACKAGE}} now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per
major device number on 2.6 kernels: @cite{LiS} cannot support this change.

@item
Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions:
support for additional @cite{SuSE} distributions on @code{ix86} as well as
@code{x86_64}.  Added distribution support includes @cite{SLES 9}, @cite{SLES 9
SP2}, @cite{SLES 9 SP3}, @cite{SLES 10}, @cite{SuSE 10.1}.

@item
Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent @command{gcc}
compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily
SUSE).

@item
Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition
to kernel programs.  Added new @option{--with-optimize} option to
@command{configure} to accomplish this.

@item
Added @command{--disable-devel} @command{configure} option to suppress building
and installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure
runtime targets that do not need the development environment (static libraries,
manual pages, documentation).

@item
Added @command{send-pr} script for automatic problem report generation.

@item
The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the 'doxy' make
target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the distribution for more
information.
