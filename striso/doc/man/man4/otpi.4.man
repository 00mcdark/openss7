.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B OTPI
is an OSI Transport Provider Interface
.IR STREAMS (4)
module that appears to the user as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
pseudo-device driver.
.PP
The driver provides OSI Transport
.[
x214
.]
protocol layer services.  Users of the driver may access Transport services using the Transport
Provider Interface (TPI),
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
or the XTI/TLI library,
.BR xti (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
The
.B otpi
driver is configured by the OSI Networking Daemon,
.BR osinetd (8).
The
.BR osinetd (8)
daemon is responsible for initializing and configuring the OSI link, network, transport and
ACSE/Presentation layers.
.PP
Without configuration, the
.B otpi
driver will allow users to open Streams on the driver and attempt to bind the device to a Transport
Address; however, as there are no networks configured, attempts to listen on a transport selector
will be restricted to private network listeners only.  Once configured for a number of networks,
users will be able to open and listen on Streams on the upper multiplex to transport selectors
supported by the available networks.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
A daemon,
.BR osinetd (8),
is used to configure the transport layer at system initialization time.  The
daemon opens and binds wildcarded network address listening Streams for each
network type available on the system.  These Streams are bound in a listening
mode only, and may be shared by other processes that push the
.BR tpcots (4)
module.  The daemon holds these Streams open and also uses them for management
purposes.
.PP
When bound for listening, the tpcots module will search for a network provider
Stream that is sharable and suitably bound.  A sharable and suitably bound
network provider Stream is a Stream that is bound as a DEFAULT_LISTENER, for
CONS, or bound to the wildcard NSAP as a DEFAULT_DEST for CLNS.  If an
existing network provider stream exists and is suitably bound, the binding
Stream will be added to the demultiplexing logic for that listening Stream.
.PP
When a bind is attempted on an upper multiplex Stream which includes a CONS NSAP, the user must
provide the lower multiplex identifier of an unbound, temporarily linked, network Stream to use in
initiator or responder roles.  In initiator roles, this Stream will be used for the outbound network
connection.  In responder roles, this Stream will be used to accept inbound network connections.
.PP
When a bind is attempted that includes a responder role, the driver will search for an appropriate
permanently linked Stream.  If one is found, for the specified bound local transport address, the
provided temporarily linked Stream will be bound in a non-listening mode and will only be used to
accept inbound network connections.  The driver adds the upper multiplex Stream to internal
demultiplexing logic.  When no appropriate permanently linked Stream is found, an attempt will be
made to bind the provided temporarily linked Stream to the requested transport address in a
listening mode.  This will fail if another user has already bound to the requested address.
.PP
Note that creating a suitable network Stream to be linked under the driver might also entail a
similar process for the network driver.  See
.BR cons (4)
and
.BR clns (4).
.PP
To avoid the necessity of temporarily linking an appropriate network provider Stream, the
.B otpi
is implemented as a generic network provider Stream that autopushes a transport
module.  In this case, the opening and temporarily  linking of the network Stream  becomes a matter
of simply opening the autopush transport entry.

.SH SERVICE INTERFACE
.PP
The
.B otpi
service interface on the upper multiplex is the Transport Provider Interface (TPI),
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
supporting the ISO Transport Service Interface
.[
x214
.]
for the ISO Transport Protocols.
.[
x224
.]
.[
x234
.]
.PP
The
.B opti
service interface on the lower multiplex is the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
supporting the ISO Network Service Inteface.
.[
x213
.]
for the ISO Network Protocols,
.[
x223
.]
.[
x224
.]
but can, in general, be any provider supporting the ISO Network Service Interface.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that transport protocol classes 0, 1, 2 and 3 are only available over a connection oriented
network service provider, such as
.BR cons (4).
Transport protocol class 4 is available over both connection oriented and connectionless underlying
networks,
.BR cons (4)
and
.BR clns (4),
and is used over the connectionless network protocol,
.BR clnp (4).

.SH HISTORY
.PP
Historically, RFC 1006 and other non-OSI transport drivers were provided separate from OSI transport
drivers.  This was true for both the USL ONP and BSD ISODE approaches.  However, that separation
made it difficult to provide initiators and responders that provided for both traditional OSI CONS
and CLNS networks as well as RFC 1006 networks.  Therefore, both the USL ONP and BSD ISODE
approaches integrated all networks into the same transport provider.
