.SH HISTORY
.PP
Historically, RFC 1006 and other non-OSI transport drivers were provided separate from OSI transport
drivers.  This was true for both the USL ONP and BSD ISODE approaches.  However, that separation
made it difficult to provide initiators and responders that provided for both traditional OSI CONS
and CLNS networks as well as RFC 1006 networks.  Therefore, both the USL ONP and BSD ISODE
approaches integrated all networks into the same transport provider.
