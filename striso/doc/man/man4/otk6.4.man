.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B OTK6
is an implementation of ISO over TCP defined in RFC 1006
.[
rfc1006
.]
and RFC 2126.
.[
rfc2126
.]
It provides reliable, packet oriented, full duplex connection between two
transport endpoints on top of
.BR tcp (7).
.B OTK6
guarantees that the data arrives in order and retransmits lost packets.  It
generates and checks a per-packet checksum to catch transmission errors.  It
preserves record boundaries.
.PP
.B OTK6
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver using the
.BR OSI (4)
.B striso
package for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[
lfs
.]
The
.B striso
package translates the
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR tcp (4)
provided by the
.BR INET (4)
.B strinet
package into TPI
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
streams suitable for use with XTI,
.[
xti revision 1.0
.]
.[
xns 5.2
.]
see
.BR xti "(3) and " xti_osi (3).
.PP
.B OTK6
provides one TPI connection-oriented ISO Transport Protocol Class 0 or Class 2
stream type with abortive release and optional expedited data.  To select the
stream,
.I rk6_device
can be one of the following:
.TP
.IR /dev/otk6 " or " /dev/streams/otk6
This device provides the ISO Transport Protocol
.[
x225
.]
services using the T-primitives of the Transport Provider Interface,
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
used for ISO Transport, as described in
.BR tpi_osi (7).
The
.BR tpi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with
the
.BR xnet (3)
or
.BR xti (3)
library and provides ISO Transport using XTI
.[
xti revision 1.0
.]
.[
xns 5.2
.]
as described in
.BR xti_osi (3).
.PP
.B OTK6
provides one socket type for use by the
.BR sockets (3)
library
.BR socket (7)
calls.
.B OTK6
provides sockets in the protocol family
.BR PF_ISO
using the protocol number
.BR IPPROTO_OSI .
The
.I socket_type
argument can be one of the following:
.TP
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET
.PP
The following entries in /etc/protosw provides the information for
.BR socksys (4)
to use the device:
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
PF_ISO       SOCK_SEQPACKET     ISOPROTO_RK6   /dev/otk6   tpi   cots
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
For additional information, see
.BR socksys (4)
and
.BR protosw (5).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The primary use for this devices is a functional replacement for the
.IR "Solaris Solstice OSI 9.2" \(rg,
OSI Transport API.
.[
sunlink-tli
.]
This interface is used specifically by ISODE and some other upper-level OSI
applications when running on
.IR Solaris \(rg.
This interface extends the same capabilities to Linux.
.\"
.\"
.SH SERVICE INTERFACE
.PP
The
.B otpi
service interface on the upper multiplex is the Transport Provider Interface (TPI),
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
supporting the ISO Transport Service Interface
.[
x214
.]
for the ISOT.
.[
rfc1006
.]
.PP
The
.B opti
service interface on the lower multiplex is the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
supporting the ISO Network Service Inteface.
.[
x213
.]
for ISOT,
.[
rfc1006
.]
but, in general, can be any provider supporting the ISO Network Service Interface.
.[
x213
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSES
.PP
OSI Transport addresses for RFC1006 are in an array of octets where the first
octet is the length,
.IR tsaplen ,
of the TSAP, followed by
.I tsaplen
octets of TSAP, followed by an octet that is the length,
.IR nsaplen ,
of the NSAP, followed by
.I nsaplen
octets of NSAP.
.PP
The TSAP is coded according to OSI Transport conventions and is simply the
T-Selector.  The NSAP is coded according to OSI NSAP conventions for IP
addresses as described in RFC 1277, RFC 1888 and RFC 4548.
.[
rfc1277
.]
.[
rfc1888
.]
.[
rfc4548
.]
The NSAP, according to these documents, consists of an AFI of 34 or 35.  For
AFI 35, the IDI is an ICP (Internet Code Point) which has the value 0000 for
IPv6 or 0001 for IPv4.  The ICP is coded as 4 BCD digits in two octets.  For
IPv5, the ICP is followed by 4 octets representing the binary IPv4 IP address,
and optionally 2 further octets representing the binary port number.
.PP
When the
.I tsaplen
is encoded as zero (0), a null T-Selector is used.  When the
.I nsaplen
is encoded as zero (0), the underlying NS-Provider is to assign an NSAP.  For
responders, the port number will be 102 or 399 depending on whether ISO
Transport Class 0 (TP0) or ISO Transport Class 2 (TP2) operation was requested.
For initiators, the remove port number will be 102 or 399 depending upon
whether ISO Transport Class 0 (TP0) or ISO Transport Class 2 (TP2) operation
was requested.
.PP
.IR "Solaris SunLink" \(rg
.[
sunlink-tli
.]
specifies that the NSAP address passed to
.BR t_bind (3)
is
.RI \(lq rk6 \(rq,
and the NSAP address passed to
.BR t_connect (3)
is a four-byte IP address (in network byte order).
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Although the
.IR "Solaris SunLink" \(rg
.[
sunlink-tli
.]
documentation indicates that there are no XTI/TLI options for the
.B otk6
driver,
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implements both the full set of OSI XTI/TPI options as described in
.BR xti_osi (3)
as well as the full set of TCP and IP options as described in
.BR xti_ip (3)
and
.BR xti_tcp (3).
.PP
When IP and TCP options are used, they are used to control the underlying
TCP/IP network connection used by the
.B otk6
OSI Transport provider.  This allows the user the ability to control some of
the more esoteric recommendations from RFC 1006 and RFC 2126, such as the
setting of keep-alive on the TCP connection.
.PP
When OSI QoS options are used, they are used to negotiate QoS requirements
with the remote OSI Transport provider and user in the same fashion as normal
OSI Transport (e.g. over CONS or CLNS); when OSI management options are used,
they are used to negotiate functional units and protocol options in the same
fashion as described for normal OSI Transport (e.g. over CONS or CLNS): both as
described in
.BR xti_osi (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH PRIMITIVES
.PP
.B otk6
does not implement any specialized primitives and implements the Transport
Provider Interface (TPI) Revision 2.0.0
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
at both its upper and lower service interfaces.  At the upper service
interface, the TPI is implemented as required for OSI Transport as described in
.BR tpi_osi (7).
At the lower service interface, the TPI is implemented as required for TCP/IP
Transport as described in
.BR tpi_tcp (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
The
.B otk6
driver does not yet support any input-output controls of its own.  The
standards STREAMS input-output controls,
.BR I_LINK "(7), " I_PLINK "(7), " I_UNLINK "(7), " I_PUNLINK (7)
are used by management programs to provision and supply TCP/IP Streams to the
lower multiplex of the driver.  This is accomplished using a control Stream, or
any Stream on the upper multiplex provided that the user has sufficient
privilege.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
This driver does not support RFC 1006
.[
rfc1006
.]
operation over UDP.
.PP
This driver does not yet support RFC 2126
.[
rfc2126
.]
ISO Transport Class 2 operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B otk6
provides an auxilliary
.BR M_CTL "(9) and " M_PCCTL (9)
interface at both the upper multiplex and the lower multiplex service
interfaces.  The purpose of these messages is functionally the same as the
.BR M_PROTO "(9) and " M_PCPROTO (9)
messages, and they contain the same TPI service primitives.  The only
difference is that, because the Stream head cannot directly generate a
.BR M_CTL "(9) or " M_PCCTL (9)
message, the receiver of the message is assured that the contents have been
supplied or verified by the sending module.  This permits many checks that are
required for user-supplied information (for security purposes) can bs skipped
for these inter-module messages.

.B otk6
supports both the TCP/IP options to control the underlying TCP/IP network
connection provider (CONS equivalent) as described in

control both ISO Transport QoS and management options associated with OSI
transport described in

Binary compatibility is not attempted: only source compatibility.  Any binary

.SH HISTORY
.PP
Historically, RFC 1006 and other non-OSI transport drivers were provided
separate from OSI transport drivers.  This was true for both the USL ONP and
BSD ISODE approaches.  However, that separation made it difficult to provide
initiators and responders that provided for both traditional OSI CONS and CLNS
networks as well as RFC 1006 networks.  Therefore, both the USL ONP and BSD
ISODE approaches integrated all networks into the same transport provider.
