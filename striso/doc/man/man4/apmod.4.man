.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B apmod
is an APLI and XAP library compatibility mode for the STREAMS ACSE/Presentation Interfaces,
.BR APLI (3)
and
.BR XAP (3).
It translates a set of
.BR ioctl (2)
commands into APLI primitives.  These
.BR ioctl (2)
commands are intended to be used with the OpenSS7 APLI Library,
.BR libapli (3),
or the OpenSS7 XAP Library,
.BR libxap (3).
In the sense that it provides intput-output controls that accomplish most of the functionality
required by the libraries, the
.B apmod
module is termed a \*(lqCooperating Module\*(rq to the libraries.  The resulting library consists
largely of interface, and does not contain much behaviour, whereas, the module consists largely of
behaviour with a direct and simple input-output control interface provided by STREAMS.
