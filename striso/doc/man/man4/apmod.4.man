.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B apmod
is an APLI and XAP library cooperating module for the STREAMS ACSE/Presentation
Interfaces,
.BR APLI (3)
and
.BR XAP (3).
It translates a set of
.BR ioctl (2)
commands into APLI primitives.  These
.BR ioctl (2)
commands are intended to be used with the
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
APLI Library,
.BR libapli (3),
or the
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
XAP Library,
.BR libxap (3).
In the sense that it provides input-output controls that accomplish most of the
functionality required by the libraries, the
.B apmod
module is termed a \*(lqCooperating Module\*(rq to the libraries.  The resulting
library consists largely of interface, and does not contain much behaviour,
whereas, the module consists largely of behaviour with a direct and simple
input-output control interface provided by
.IR STREAMS .
.PP
One of the major purposes of this apprach and the
.B apmod
module is to provide thread-safe operations in support of the APLI Library.
.BR apmod
does not alter any messages passed with
.BR putmsg (2)
or
.BR putpmsg (2s),
or received with
.BR getmsg (2)
or
.BR getpmsg (2s).
.BR romod
simply intercepts responses to its own primitives sent downstream as a result
of an
.BR ioctl (2)
command.
.PP
Unlike the
.BR sockmod (4)
module,
.BR romod
makes no adjustments to the Stream head for
.BR read (2)
options (See
.BR I_SRDOPT (7)
under
.BR streamio (7)).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B apmod
STREAMS module is not normally pushed directly by XAP client programs, but is
either pushed or autopushed as necessary, either by the OSI network
configuration daemon,
.BR osinetd (8),
the autopush facility,
.BR autopush (8),
or the XAP Library itself (when
.BR ap_init_evn (3)
is called).
Nevertheless, the module may be pushed in a non-portable way by clients of
sufficient privilege to acheive specific effects, such as for testing.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
As it appears that other implementations of the APLI Library are
solely contained in user-space libraries, using IPC for communication with
clients, there is no evident standard upper level service interface for APLI.
Therefore,
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
has specified and implements an APLI service interface modelling the primitives
consistent with the
.BR ap_snd (3)
and
.BR ap_rcv (3)
function descriptions and the ACSE service interface.
.[
x217
.]
.PP
Again, there is no evident standard implementation of a lower level service
interface.  It appears that some APLI Library implementations may use the
Transport Provider Interface (TPI) or the XTI or XTI-mOSI interfaces directly.
Therefore, again,
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
has specified and implements a Presentation Provider Interface (PPI),
.BR PPI (7),
service interface modelling the presentation primitives consistent with the
.BR ap_snd (3)
and
.BR ap_rcv (3)
function descriptions and the Presentation service interface.
.[
x216
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSES
.PP
Addresses consist of an AP-Title, AE-Qualifier, and Presentation address.  The
Presentation Address (PSAP) consists of a P-Selector and a TSAP.  The TSAP, in
turn, consists of a T-Selector and an NSAP.  The NSAP is an OSI network address.
.PP
Addresses are formatted as described in
.BR ap_env (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options and option lists are internally formatted as described for XTI in
.BR t_optmgmt (3).
Option names and values are as described in
.BR ap_env (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH PRIMITIVES
.PP
Primitives supported by the upper level service interface are modelled after
the primitives described in
.BR apli (3)
and are as follows:
.BR A_ASSOC_REQ "(7),
.BR A_ASSOC_IND "(7),
.BR A_ASSOC_RSP "(7),
.BR A_ASSOC_CNF "(7),
.BR A_ABORT_REQ "(7),
.BR A_ABORT_IND "(7),
.BR A_PABORT_REQ "(7),
.BR A_PABORT_IND "(7),
.BR A_RELEASE_REQ "(7),
.BR A_RELEASE_IND "(7),
.BR A_RELEASE_RSP "(7),
.BR A_RELEASE_CNF "(7).
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
.B xapmod
implements a non-standard (non-traditional) set of input-output controls for
cooperating with the
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
XAP Library.  These input-output controls correspond to, and implement, the
XAP functions,
.BR xap (3).
Because the STREAMS service interface is an inherently asynchronous interface,
it is necessary to use input-output controls to implement synchronous (blocking)
functions.  This can be achieved by using a cooperating module in the manner of
.BR timod (4).

Information on this manual page is specific to the

.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
It appears from descriptions of the APLI Library
.[
sunlink-apli
.]
that the library has been implemented on a number of OSI implementations as a
user-space daemon library facility that uses IPC to communicate with library
client programs.  Under this approach, the Library daemon process would be
responsible for opening transport or presentation Streams and performing
multiplexing and de-multiplexing between clients.
.PP
The
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implementation uses this
.B apmod
cooperating module and a regular shared Library that links into the client's
address space to implement the library.  Also, the
.BR oopi (4)
or similar presentation devices are implemented as a STREAMS multiplexing
driver.  It is the author's contention that a Linux Fast-STREAMS multiplexing
driver is far faster than a single-threaded, full-blown user space process, and
that the multiplexing driver exhibits better scheduling characteristics.

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Other implementations do not document any cooperating module nor input-output
controls.  Portable applications should never use input-output controls
directly.
.IP \(em
Other implementations do not document the primitive format between the library
and any cooperating module.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted.  Binary compatibility is not possible due
to the lack of standardized symbolic constants.  Any binary compatibility
experienced is a bug and is scheduled to be removed on the next release.
