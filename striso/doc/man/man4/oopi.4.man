.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B OOPI
is an OSI ACSE/Presentation Interface
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing pseudo-device driver.
.PP
The driver provides Session, Presentation, ACSE and ROSE OSI protocol layer
services.  For normal OSI transport providers, the driver provides full OSI
Session, Presentation and ASCE services.  Users of the driver may access
ACSE/Presentation services using the ACSE/Presentation Library Interface
(APLI),
.[
apli UNIX International
.]
.BR apli (3),
or the X/Open ACSE/Presentation Library Interface (XAP),
.[
xap c303
.]
.BR xap (3).
ROSE services may be provided optionally using the ACSE/Presentation ROSE
Interface (APRI) or the X/Open ACSE/Presentation Library Inteface for ROSE
(XAP-ROSE).
.[
xap-rose
.]
DTP services may be provided optionally using the X/Open ACSE/Presentation
Library Interface for DTP (XAP-TP).
.[
xap-tp
.]
.PP
Additional OSI application services can be provided by the
XMHS,
.[
xmhs
.]
XMS,
.[
xms
.]
XDS,
.[
xds
.]
XMP.
.[
xmp
.]
These library interfaces, based on XOM,
.[
xom
.]
provide services via the APLI/XAP libraries which utilize almost exclusively the
.B oopi
driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
The
.B oopi
drivers is configured by the OSI Networking Daemon,
.BR osinetd (8).
The
.BR osinetd (8)
daemon is responsible for initializing and configuring the OSI network layer,
transport layer, and ACSE/Presentation layer.
.PP
Without configuration, the
.B oopi
driver will allow uses to open Streams on the driver and attempt to bind the
device to a Presentation Address; however, as there are no transports
configured, all attempts to bind to a presentation address will fail.  Once
configured for a number of transports, users will be able to open and bind
Streams on the upper multiplex to Presentation addresses supported by the
available transports.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Although the
.B oopi
driver provides a service primitive interface at the upper boundary to
ACSE/Presentation users, this service primitive interface is OpenSS7 specific
and cannot be used directly in a portable way.  To utilize the driver in a
portable way, the APLI
.[
alpi UNIX International
.]
.[
sunlink-apli
.]
.BR apli (3),
or XAP,
.[
xap c303
.]
.BR xap (3),
library interfaces should be used.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
The
.B oopi
driver provides an ASCE/Presentation ROSE Interface (APRI) at its upper
service interface and a Transport Provider Interface (TPI),
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
at its lower boundary.
In addition to providing an APLI user interface at the upper service
interface boundary, the
.B oopi
driver also provide a specialized management stream.
