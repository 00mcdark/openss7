.SH NAME
.B xx25
\- An X.25 using XTI module for X.25.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.br
.B #include <xti_xx25.h>
.HP
\fBint\fP \fIxx25_stream\fB = t_open(\fIdevice\fP, \fIflags\fP);
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B xx25
is a pushable
.I STREAMS
module that converts between the NPI
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
CONS service interface
.[
x223
.]
.[
iso8878
.]
for X.25
.[
x25
.]
.[
iso8208
.]
and the XTI/TLI
.[
xti revision 1.0
.]
interface for X.25 (called XX25).
.[
xx25
.]
The module may be pushed over any OSI conforming CONS NS Provider that
implements the NPI interface.  Examples are X.25 drivers, IS0 8208 drivers,
XOT drivers, RFC 1006 or RFC 2126 CONS replacement drivers.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B xx25
module is not normally pushed directly by user level programs, except for
testing of the module.  Normally, an
.BR autopush (8)
specification is made including the
.BR xx25
module to be pushed over a particular device entry so that the device entry
may be directly opened using the
.BR t_open (3)
XTI library call,
.BR xti (3).
Such an entry automatically pushes the
.B xx25
module over the NPI stream provided by a given CONS provider to form a TPI
interface that conforms immediately to the XX25
.[
xx25
.]
interface specification,
.BR xti_x25 (3).
.\"
.\"
.\".SH INTERFACE
.\".PP
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSES
.PP
The address formats supported by the
.B xx25
module are those address formats supported by the XX25
.[
xx25
.]
interface as described in
.BR xti_x25 (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The options supported by the
.B xx25
module are those options supported by the XX25
.[
xx25
.]
interface as described in
.BR xti_x25 (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH PRIMITIVES
.PP
The upper service primitive interface for the
.B xx25
module is the Transport Provider Interface (TPI) Revision 2.0.0 interface,
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
as intepreted for XX25
.[
xx25
.]
operation as described in
.BR xti_x25 (3).
.PP
The lower service primitive interface for the
.B xx25
module is the Network Provider Interface (NPI) Revision 2.0.0. interface.
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
The
.B xx25
module does not implement any input-output controls of its own.  All
input-output controls are passed along the Stream over which the
.B xx25
module is pushed.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
This module is not normally pushed directy by user-level processes, but is
combined with an
.BR autopush (8)
specification to provide a device name that can be opened directly by processes
using the
.BR t_open (3)
procedure of
.BR xti (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B xx25
is implemented as a pushable STREAMS module.  It implements a fairly
straightforward conversion between TPI primitives
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
and DLPI primitives, with additional considerations for option conversion.
.PP
The module implements an
.BR M_CTL "(9) and " M_PCCTL (9)
message interface that provides a more efficient inter-module communications
alternative to the
.BR M_PROTO "(9) and " M_PCPROTO (9)
message interface.

has no known bugs.
.B xx25
will be tested with the

conformance test suite.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B xx25
is compatible with XX25,
.[
xx25
.]
and implementations based on XX25 or earlier TLI interfaces, such as
.IR "Solaris SunLink" \(rg,
.[
sunlink-tli
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility.  The lack of
standard symbolic constants precludes binary compatibilty.  Any binary
compatibility exhibited by the module is a bug and scheduled to be removed on
the next release.
.IP \(em
.IR "Solaris SunLink" \(rg
.[
sunlink-tli
.]
used the older TLI interface (precursor to XTI) and some strange option
structures incompatible with XX25.
.[
xx25
.]
.IP \(em
.IR "HP-UX OTS/9000" \(rg
.[

used either a sockets interface or an NLI interface not directly related to
NPI.

See
.BR xti (3),
.BR xti_x25 (3)
and
.IR STREAMS (4)
for additional compatibility information.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
Use of the XTI/TLI library for accessing an X.25 link was likely first
conceived by the
.IR "Solaris SunLink" \(rg
.[
sunlink-tli
.]
product or earlier by AT&T.  The lack of desire to standardize the AT&T NPI
interface as a user access layer was likely behind uses of XTI/TLI for this
purpose.  Later, X/Open (now the Open Group) standardized XTI library access
to X.25 with the XX25 specification.
