.SH NAME
.B momod
\- Minimal OSI to ASCE/Presentation Module.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B momod
is a service interface conversion module that converts betweent the Minimal OSI XTI interface
.[
xns 5.2
.]
described in
.BR xti_mosi (3),
and the ACSE/Presentation Library Interface service primitive interface described in
.BR apli (7).
The purpose of this module is to autopush the module over drivers implementing the
.BR xti_mosi (3)
interface for direct use by the
.BR ap_open (3)
function of the
.BR libapli (3)
or
.BR libxap (3)
libraries.
.PP
In particular, the
.BR lpp (4)
driver implements the Lightweight Presentation Protocol
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B momod
STREAMS module is not normally pushed directly by an XTI-mOSI
client programs, but is either pushed or autopushed as
necessary, either by the OSI network configuration daemon,
.BR osinetd (8),
or the autopush facility,
.BR autopush (8).
Nevertheless, the module may be pushed by clients of sufficient
privilege to acheive specific effects, such as for testing.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
The upper service interface for the module is
the Transport Provider Interface (TPI),
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
as interpreted for XTI-mOSI
.[
xns 5.2
.]
operation,
.BR xti_mosi (3).
The lower service interface for the module is
the Transport Provider Interface (TPI),
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
as interpreted for OSI
.[
xns 5.2
.]
operation,
.BR xti_osi (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSES
.PP
Addresses consist of an AP-Title,
AE-Qualifier, and Presentation address.  The
Presentation Address (PSAP) consists of a
P-Selector and a TSAP.  The TSAP, in turn,
consists of a T-Selector and an NSAP.  The
NSAP is an OSI network address.
.PP
Addresses are formated as described in
.BR xti_mosi (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options and option lists are internally
formated as described for XTI in
.BR t_optmgmt (3).
Option name and values are as described in
.BR xti_mosi (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH PRIMITIVES
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
.B momod
does not implement any input-output controls
of its own an passes all received
input-output controls downstream.
.B momod
is intended on being used with the
.BR timod (4)
module when used with the XTI Library,

.SH COMPATIBILITY

.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[

.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Other implementations do not document any cooperating module nor
input-output controls.  Portable applications should never use
input-output controls directly.
.IP \(em
Other implementations do not document primitive format between
the library and any cooperating module.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted.  Binary compatibility is
not possible due to the lack of standardized symbolic
constants.  Any binary compatibility experienced is a bug and
is scheduled to be removed on the next release.
