.SH NAME
.B lpp
\- Lightweight Presentation Protocol (LPP)
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B LPP
is an implementation of the
.IR "Lightweight Presentation Protocol (LPP)" ,
as described in
RFC 1085.
.[
rfc1085
.]
.B LPP
is used primarily by CMOT,
.BR cmot (4),
as described in
RFC 1095
.[
rfc1095
.]
and then
RFC 1189.
.[
rfc1189
.]
.B LPP
provides a mechanism for transporting presentation layer PDUs over TCP or UDP
(with serious cautions about using UDP for such things).
.PP
.B LPP
can be implemented as a
.I STREAMS
pushable module that is pushed over a TCP (tpi) stream.  The resulting Stream
can still present a TPI interface, just a TPI-mOSI interface as described in
XNS 5.2.
