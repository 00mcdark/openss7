.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to report a management notification.  This operation may be called in
asynchronous mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
The management session against which this operation is performed.
This must be a private object previously returned from
.BR mp_bind (3).
.TP
.I context
The management context to be used for this operation.
This argument must be a private object or the contant
.RB ( MP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT ).
The service may be requested in a confirmed mode or in a non-confirmed mode.  In the confirmed mode,
a reply is expected unlike the non-confirmed mode.  An SNMP trap can only be sent in a non-confirmed
mode.
.TP
.I argument
The information supplied as an argument of the notification to be reported.
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
For a CMIS event report, it is an instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_EVENT_REPORT_ARGUMENT }.
.IP \(bu
For an SNMP trap, it is an instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_TRAP_PDU }.
.RE

.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.I status
If the function is called synchronously, the value
.RB [ MP_SUCCESS ]
indicates that the action was completed.  If call asynchronously, the value
.RB [ MP_SUCCESS ]
indicates that the operation was initiated.
.TP
.I result_return
Upon successful completion of a synchronous call, when the service was requested in a confirmed
mode, the result is one instance of OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_EVENT_REPORT_RESULT }
or
.RB { MP_C_SERVICE_ERROR }.
It may be absent (in which case it is the constant
.RB ( MP_ABSENT_OBJECT )).
.TP
.I invoke_id_return
The invoke identifier of the initiated management operation when invoked asynchronously.
Significant if requested in a confirmed mode.
