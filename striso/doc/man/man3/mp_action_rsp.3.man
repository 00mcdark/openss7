.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to reply to a previously invoked confirmed action operation.  This function
can only be called in synchronous mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
The management session against which the operation is performed.  This must be a private object
previously returned from
.BR mp_bind (3).
.TP
.I context
The management context to be used for this operation.  This argument must be a private object or the
constant
.RB ( MP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT ).
.TP
.I response
The information supplied as a response to an action operation.
The response is one of the following:
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
When an action is performed on no objects, this is indicated by the constant
.RB ( MP_ABSENT_OBJECT )
as the response.
.IP \(bu
When an action is performed on a single object, this is indicated by one instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_ACTION_RESULT }
as the response.
.IP \(bu
When an action is peformed on multiple objects or entails multiple responses, this is indicated by
one or more
.BR mp_action_rsp ()
calls, once for each selected object or response, followed by a final \*(lqempty\*(rq
.BR mp_action_rsp ().
Each
.BR mp_action_rsp ()
call includes a response which contains an instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_LINKED_REPLY_ARGUMENT },
contaning exactly one of the following OM attributes:
.RS
.TP
.RB [ MP_ACTION_RESULT ]
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ MP_ACTION_ERROR ]
.TP
.RB [ MP_PROCESSING_FAILURE ]

call includes a response which contains only the constant
.RB ( MP_ABSENT_OBJECT ).
