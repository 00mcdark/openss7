.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to perform an action.  The function may be called in asyncrhonous mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
The management session against which this operation is performed.  This must be a private object
previously returned from
.BR mp_bind (3).
.TP
.I context
The management context to be used for this operation.  This argument must be a private object or the
constant
.RB [ MP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT ].
The service may be requested in a confirmed mode or a non-confirmed mode.  In confirmed mode, a
reply is expected.
.TP
.I argument
The information supplied as the argument of an action operation is an instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_ACTION_ARGUMENT },
that has been prepared by the caller.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.I status
If the function is called synchronously, the value
.RB [ MP_SUCCESS ]
indicates that the action was completed.  If called asynchronously, the value
.RB [ MP_SUCCESS ]
indicates that the operation was initiated.
.TP
.I result_return
Upon successful completion of a synchronous call, when the operation was requred in a confirmed
mode, the result is one of the following:
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
When the action is requested in a non-confirmed mode, no results are expected and the constant
.RB [ MP_ABSENT_OBJECT ]
is returned as the result.
.IP \(bu
When a confirmed mode action is performed on no objects, this is indicated by the constant
.RB [ MP_ABSENT_OBJECT ]
as the result.
.IP \(bu
When a confirmed mode action is performed on a single object, this is indicated by one instand of
the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_ACTION_RESULT }
or a
.BR Service-Error .
.IP \(bu
When a confirmed mode action is performed on multiple objects or entails multiple responses, this is
indicated by one instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_MULTIPLE_REPLY },
which contains a set of instances of OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_LINKED_REPLY_ARGUMENT }
(one for each selected object or for each response to a multiple-action operation request on a
single managed object).  Each
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_LINKED_REPLY_ARGUMENT }
contains exactly one of the following OM attributes:
.RS
.TP
.RB [ MP_ACTION_RESULT ]
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ MP_ACTION_ERROR ]
.TP
.RB [ MP_PROCESSING_FAILURE ]
.PD
.RE
.RE
.TP
.I invoke_id_return
The invoke identifier of the initiated management operation when invoked asynchronously.  It is
significant in the case of a confirmed mode request.
