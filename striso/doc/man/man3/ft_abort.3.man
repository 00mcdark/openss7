.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xftam.h>
.HP
.B FT_return_code ft_abort(
.br
.BI "OM_private_object " session ,
.br
.BI "OM_uint32 " association_id ,
.br
.BI "OM_private_object *" api_out );
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function aborts an association and any operation currently in progress on
that association.  Any such operation is no longer outstanding and its result
will never be returned by \fBft_rcvresult\fP(3).
.PP
This function differs from \fBft_abandon\fP(3) in that it will destroy the
XFTAM association as well as any outstanding operations for this associaiton.
As with \fBft_abandon\fP(3), no statement is made regarding the state of the
file(s) and filestore(s) involved in the aborted operation.
.PP
If the value of \fIassociation_id\fP does not represent an existing association
within the XFTAM instance referenced by the \fIsession\fP parameter, an error
code is returned [\fBFT_INV_ASSOC\fP].
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.BI session " (Private Object (Session))
This parameter is a handle for a private object of the class \fIsession\fP that
identifies the particular XFTAM instance that is to perform the required
operation.
.TP
.BI association_id " (OM_uint32)
This parameter is an integer that identifies the association to be aborted.
.RS
.PP
The value of \fIassociation_id\fP must be that returned by \fBft_connect\fP(3)
when the association was created.
.RE
.TP
.BI api_out " (Private Object (API-Output-Parameters))
This parameter is always returned and is a handle for the private object of
class \fIAPI-Output-Parameters\fP.  It returns API-specific output parameters
for this function call.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
\fBft_abort\fP() returns either [\fBFTE_SUCCESS\fP] or one of the values listed
in ERRORS.

Only source compatibility is attempted.  Binary compatibility will fail due to
the lack of published and standard symbolic constants.  Any binary
compatibility experienced is a bug and will be removed in the next release.
