.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function returns the negotiated connection values associated with an incoming
.B Receive-Result-Or-Argument
object previously supplied by
.BR mp_receive (3).
The caller provides a
.I request_mask
to identify which values are to be returned in result objects.
.PP
This function may be used with automated connection management enabled or disabled.  In either case,
the values returned are those associated with the underlying connection on which the incoming
.I receive_result_or_argument
arrived.  In connectionless environments, the values returned are those associated with the incoming
.I receive_result_or_argument
message (for example,
.BR Responder-Address ).
.PP
Certain requested values may not be available for the input object (that is, inappropriate for the
underlying protocol) and may therefore be absent from the result.  The values actually returned are
indicated by the function result.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I receive_result_or_argument
This object contains an asynchronous response or indication, as previously returned to the user from
the
.BR mp_receive (3)
function.
.TP
.I request_mask
The
.I request_mask
specifies which connection values should be returned as result objects.  The mask is composed of bit
values which must be set on (1) to request that the corresponding connection value be returned.
Connection values which can be obtained by calling this function are:
.RS
.TP
.RB [ MP_T_PRESENTATION_CONTEXT_LIST ]
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ MP_T_RESPONDER_ADDRESS ]
.TP
.RB [ MP_T_APPLICATION_CONTEXT ]

.RB [ MP_T_AUTHENTICATION_INFORMATION ]

.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.I results_mask
A mask indicating which connection values have been returned as part of the result objects below.
This mask has the same structure as the
.I request_mask
argument.  All bits off (0) indicates no values were available for the input object.
.TP
.I pres_layer_args
Upon completion of this function, this object contains the negotiated connection values associated
with the
.I receive_result_or_argument
object.
This object is returned only when the
.I result_mask
bit
.RB [ MP_T_PRESENTATION_CONTEXT_LIST ]
is set on; otherwise,
.RB [ MP_ABSENT_OBJECT ]
is returned for this object.
.TP
.I acse_args
Upon completion of this function, this object contains the negotiated connection values associated
with the
.I receive_result_or_argument
object.  This object is returned only when the
.I result_mask
bit
.RB [ MP_T_RESPONDER_ADDRESS ],
.RB [ MP_T_RESPONDER_TITLE ],
.RB [ MP_T_APPLICATION_CONTEXT ],
.RB [ MP_T_AUTHENTICATION_INFORMATION ],
or
.RB [ MP_T_ACSE_USER_INFO ]
is set on; otherwise,
.RB [ MP_ABSENT_OBJECT ]
is returned for this object.
.TP
.I cmip_assoc_args
Upon completion of this function, this object contains the negotiated connection values associated
with the
.I receive_result_or_argument
object.  This object is returned only when the
.I result_mask
bit
.RB [ MP_T_CMIS_FUNCTIONAL_UNITS ],
.RB [ MP_T_ACCESS_CONTROL ],
or
.RB [ MP_T_USER_INFO ]
is set on; otherwise,
.RB [ MP_ABSENT_OBJECT ]
is returned for this object.
.TP
.I standard_externals
Upon completion of this function, this object contains the negotiated connection values associated
with the
.I receive_result_or_argument
object.  This object is returned only when the
.I result_mask
bit
.RB [ MP_T_SMASE_USER_DATA ]
is set to on; otherwise,
.RB [ MP_ABSENT_OBJECT ]
is returned for this object.
