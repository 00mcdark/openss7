.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to abort a management session that is either connected or partially connected.
The service is defined as an unconfirmed service.  A reply is not expected.
.PP
Once an abort is issued, the connected session is implicitly unconnected and unbound.  All
oustanding requests that pertain to this sesssion are returned with the error
.RB [ MP_E_SESSION_TERMINATED ].
This includes any wait request on that session.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
The connected (or partially connected) session against which this operation is performed.  This must
be a private object previously returned as part of an
.B Assoc-Result
or
.B Assoc-Argument
or returned explicity from an asynchronously called
.BR mp_assoc_req (3).
This session object must have ACM disabled.
.TP
.I context
The management context used for this operation.  This argument must be a private object.
.sp
Once a session is connected or partially connected, the precedence rules for common parameters
within the
.I session
and the
.I context
objects are different.  Once connected, the responder address and responder title can not be
overridden by the
.I context
object.
.TP
.I argument
The information supplied as the argument of an
.BR mp_abort (3)
operation.
