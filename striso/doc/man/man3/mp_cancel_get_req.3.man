.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function cancels the result of an outstanding asynchronous
.BR mp_get_req (3)
function call in an orderly manner; the
.BR mp_get_req (3)
function is no longer outstanding after the service confirmation of the cancel-get operation is
received by
.BR mp_receive (3)
and thereafter the further replies of the
.BR mp_get (3)
operation will never be returned by
.BR mp_receive (3).
This function can only be called in asynchronous mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
The management session in which the
.BR mp_get (3)
operation was requested.
This must be a private object previously returned from
.BR mp_bind (3).
.TP
.I context
The management context to be used for this operation.
This argument must be a private object or the contant
.RB ( MP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT ).
The service is defined as a confirmed service.  A single reply is expected.
.TP
.I argument
Selects the specific outstanding asynchronous
.BR mp_get (3)
operation submitted via the
.I session
to be aborted.  It is an instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CANCEL_GET_ARGUMENT }.
The value of the OM attribute
.RB [ MP_GET_INVOKE_ID ]
must be that which was returned by the
.BR mp_get_req (3)
function call that intiated the asynchronous management
.BR mp_get (3)
operation to be cancelled.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.I status
Indicates whether or not the
.B Cancel-get
operation was initiated.
.TP
.I invoke_id_return
The invoke identifier of the initiated
.B Cancel-get
(asynchronous) operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
This function can return a
.B System-Error
or one of the following
.BR Library-Error s:
