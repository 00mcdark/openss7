.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to analyze any OM-Object to validate its structure.  It may be used as a debug
tool prior to issuing other XMP function calls.  It may also be used after XMP function calls that
return
.RB [ MP_E_BAD_ARGUMENT ].
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I workspace
Specifies the workspace (obtained froma call to
.BR mp_initialize (3)),
in which a
.RB { MP_C_BAD_ARGUMENT }
OM object will be created if the return status is
.RB [ MP_E_BAD_ARGUMENT ].
.I test_object
does not need to be from this workspace.
.TP
.I test_object
The OM-Object to analyze and validate.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.I status
Indicates whether or not the validation was successful.  A value of
.RB [ MP_E_BAD_ARGUMENT ]
indicates a validation failure and problem details are in the
.I bad_argument_return
parameter.
.TP
.I bad_argument_return
If
.I status
is
.RB [ MP_E_BAD_ARGUMENT ],
the result is one instance of the OM Class
.RB { MP_C_BAD_ARGUMENT }.
