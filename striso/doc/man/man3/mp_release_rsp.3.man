.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to reply to a previously invoked release operation.  This function can only be
called in syncrhonous mode.  This request will cause all oustanding request that pertain to this
session to be returned with the error session-terminated.  This includes any wait request on that
session.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
The management session against which this operation is performed.
This must be a private object previously returned from as part of an
.B Assoc-Argument
or
.BR Assoc-Result .
This session object must have ACM disabled, and it must be in a connected state.
.TP
.I context
The management context to be used for this operation.
This argument must be a private object or the contant
.RB ( MP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT ).
Once a session is connected or partially connected, the precedence rules for common parameters
within the session and context objects are different: once connected, the responder address and
title cannot be overridden by the context object.
.TP
.I response
The information supplied as response of a release operation.  For a release operation, the response
is one of the following:
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
When a release is accepted, this is indicated by one instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_RELEASE_RESULT }
as the response.  The reason should be set to
.RB ( MP_NORMAL ).
Once a releas has been accepted, the session object is implicitly unconnected and unbound.  The user
cannot use this session object again with any more XMP calls.
.IP \(bu
When a release is rejected, this is indicated by one instance of the OM class
.RB { MC_C_RELEASE_RESULT }.
The reason should be set to either
.BR [ MP_NOT_FINISHED ]
or
.BR [ MP_USER_DEFINED ].
Once a release has been rejected, the session is still connected to the remote peer.
.RE
.TP
.I invoke_id
The invoke identifier of the requested operation to which the reply applies.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.I status
Indicates whether or not the release response was completed.
