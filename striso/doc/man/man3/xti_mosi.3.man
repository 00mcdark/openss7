Application Context Name
.sp
An application context name identifies a set of tasks to be performed by an
application.  It is exchanged during association establishment with the
purpose
of conveying a common
understanding of the work to be done.
.sp
This parameter is exposed to offer some negotiation capabilities to the
application and to
increase the chances of interoperability.
.sp
When receiving a non suitable or unknown value from a peer application, the
application
may propose an alternate value or decide to terminate prematurely the
association.
.sp
A default value (in the form of an Object Identifier) is provided, identifying
a generic XTI-mOSI
application. Its value can be found in XNS

Presentation Contexts
.sp
A presentation context is the association of an abstract syntax with a
transfer syntax. The presentation context is used by the application to
identify how the data is structured and by the OSI Application Layer to
identify how the data should be encoded/decoded.
.sp
A generic presentation context is defined for a stream-oriented, unstructured,
data transfer service with
.I null
encoding:
.[
rfc1085
.]
.sp
.IR abstract\0syntax :
The single data type of this abstract syntax is a sequence of octets that are
defined in the application protocol specification as being consecutive octets
on a stream-oriented transport mechanism, without regard for any semantic or
other boundaries.
.sp
.IR transfer\0syntax :
The data value shall be represented as an octet-aligned presentation data
value. If two or more data values are concatenated together they are
considered to be a single (longer) data value. (This is the
.I null
encoding rule).

Presentation Context Definition and Result List, Defined Context Set
.sp
As negotiation occurs between the peer OSI Application layers, the
presentation context(s) proposed by the application may not be accepted.

.SH ADDRESS
.PP
The \fBaddr\fP structure (used in \fBt_bind\fP(3), \fBt_connect\fP(3), \fBt_accept\fP(3)) is a
combined naming and addressing data type, identifying one end or the other of the association.
The address part is a Presentation Address.  The calling and called addresses are required
parameters, while the use of a responding address is optional.
.PP
The name part (AP Title, AE Qualifier and the AP and AE invocation-identifiers) are always optional.
ISO Directory facilities, when available, can relate the name parts (identifying specific
applications) to the addresses of the real locations where they can be accessed.
.PP
The general format of the \fBaddr\fP structure is described below, while its precise structure, and,
in particular, the contents of the Presentation Address, is implementation dependent.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options are formatted according to the \fBt_opthdr\fP structure as described in \fBt_optmgmt\fP(3).
An OSI provider compliant to this XTI-mOSI specification supports all, none or a subset of the
options defined in ACSE/Presentation Connection-mode Service.  An implementation may restrict the
use of any of the options by offering them in privileged or read-only mode.
.PP
For the default abstract syntax, transfer syntax and application context, XTI-mOSI uses object
identifiers which are specified in the profile (ISO/IEC ISP 11188-3).

.B T_AP_CNTX_NAME
Application Context Name.
An application context name identifies a set of tasks to be performed by an application.  It is
exchanged during the association establishment with the purpose of conveying a common understanding
of the work to be done.  This parameter is expesed to offer some negotiation capabilities to the
application and increase the chances of interoperability.  When receiving a non-suitable or unknown
value from a peer application, the application may propose an alternate value or decide to terminate
prematurely the association.  A default value (in the form of an Object Identifier) is provided,
identifying a generic XTI-mOSI application.
The default Application Context for mOSI is the OBJECT IDENTIFIER:
.IR "{ iso(1) standard(0) curl(11188) mosi(3) default-application-context(3) }"
or
.BR "28 B4 57 03 03" .

for mOSI.
.TP
.B T_AP_PCL

.PP
Presentation Contexts.
A presentation context is the association of an abstract syntax with a transfer syntax.  The
presentation context is used by the application to identify how the data is structured and by the
OSI Application Layer to identify how the data should be encoded/decoded.  A generic presentation
context is defined for a stream-oriented, unstructured, data transfer service with null encoding:
.PP
Abstract Syntax: the single data type of this abstract syntax is a sequence of octets that are
defined in the application protocol specification as being consecutive octets on a stream-oriented
transport mechanism, without regard for any semantic or other boundaries.
The default Abstract Syntax for mOSI is the OBJECT IDENTIFIER:
.IR "{ iso(1) standard(0) curl(11188) mosi(3) default-abstract-syntax(1) version(1) }"
or
.BR "28 B4 57 03 01 01" .
.[
x638
.]
.PP
Transfer Syntax: the data value shall be represented as an octet-aligned presentation data value.
If two or more data values are concatenated together, they are considered to be a single (longer)
data value.  (This is the null encoding rule.)  The default trasnfer syntax and the abstract syntax
are identical, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER for the default abstract syntax is used.  If they are not
identical, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER for the default transfer syntax is:
.IR "{ iso(1) standard(0) curl(11188) mosi(3) default-transfer-syntax(2) version(1) }"
or
.BR "28 B4 57 03 02 01" .
.[
x638
.]
Note: in the
presentation data value of the PDV list of Presentation Protocol or in the encoding of User
Information of ACSE Protocol, only octet-aligned or arbitrary can be used for default trasnfer
syntax for mOSI.  Single-ASN1-type cannot be used for default transfer syntax for mOSI.
.PP
The value of the Object Identifiers for this generic presentation context are described.
.PP
Presentation Context Definition and Result List, Defined Context Set.
As negotiation occurs between the peer OSI Application layers, the presentation context(s) proposed
by the application may not be accepted.  The Presentation Context Definition and Result List
indicates, for each of the proposed presentation contexts, it if is accepted or, if not, provides a
reason code; the application may choose to terminate the association prematurely if it does not suit
its requirements.

.TP
.B T_AP_CNTX_NAME
Application Context Name.
A default value (for a generic XTI-mOSI application) is provided.  The application may choose to
propose, through this option, a value different from the default one.  The application may also use
this option to check the value returned by the peer application and decide if the association should
be kept or terminated.
.sp
This option is of end-to-end significance.
It may be negotiated in the XTI states T_IDLE and T_INCON, and are read-only in all other states
except T_UNINT.
.TP
.B T_AP_PCL
Presentation Context Definition and Result List.
A default is provided: a list with one presentation context (the stream-oriented, unstructured, data
transfer service with null encoding).  The abstract syntax is the default abstract syntax and the
transfer syntax is the default transfer syntax.  The codes for the result of negotiation and reason
for rejection are defined.  The responding application, after reading this option, may choose to
continue or terminate the association.  Only a single abstract syntax and transfer syntax can be
used by XTI-mOSI.  On \fBt_accept\fP(3), this is assumed to be the first usable abstract syntax and
the first transfer syntax for that abstract syntax.
.sp
When intiating a connection, the application proposes one or more presentation contexts, each
comprising an abstract syntax and one or more transfer syntaxes in the Presentation Control
Definition and Result List option (or omits this option to select the CULR-3
.[
x638
.]
defaults), and issues a
\fBt_connect\fP(3).  If the connection is accepted, the Presentation Context Definition and Result
List is updated to reflect the results of negotiation of each eleemnt of the context list, and a
single presentation context is selected.  Note: if the responder accepts multiple presentation
contexts, the XTI-mOSI provider aborts the connection on receipt of the A-ASSOCIATE confirm.  When
responding to a remote connect, the application can specifically mark presentation contexts as
rejected using the \fIres\fP field, and can re-order the syntax array to select a single transfer
syntax.  On calling \fBt_accept\fP(3), the first presentation context marked as accepted is
selected, and all other contexts omitted or not marked rejected-user are makred by the provider as
rejected (T_PCL_PREJ_LMT_DCS_EXCEED).  In an accepted context, the provider will accept the first (r
only remaining) transfer syntax.  Note: on return to the application from \fBt_listen\fP(), all
supportable presentation context are marked as accepted in the \fBT_AP_PCL\fP option, and all
unsupportable contexts are marked as rejected-provider.  This permits the application to return the
same option value on \fBt_accept\fP(3) (or leave it unchanged) to select the first available
abstract syntax and transfer syntax.
.sp
This option is of end-to-end significance.
It may be negotiated in the XTI states T_IDLE and T_INCON, and are read-only in all other states
except T_UNINT.

The application may alos use this option to check the value returned by the peer application and
decide if the datagram should be kept or discarded.
.sp
This option is of end-to-end significance.
It may be negotiated in all XTI states except T_UNINIT.
.TP
.B T_AP_PCL
Presentation Context Definition and Result List.
In the connectionless mode, the transfer syntaxes are not negotiated.  Their use is determined by
the sending application entity, and must be acceptable by the receiving application entity.  A
default value is provided by XTI: a list with one element, the generic presentation context (the
stream-oriented, unstructured, data transfer service with null encoding).  The corresponding
abstract and transfer syntaxes are specified.
.sp
Only a single abstract syntax and transfer syntax can be used by connectionless-mode XTI-mOSI.  If
more than one presentation context is present in the options list for \fBt_sndudata\fP(3), the first
is used.
.sp
This option is of end-to-end significance.
It may be negotiated in all XTI states except T_UNINIT.

.SS Transport Options
.PP
Some of the options defined for the XTI ISO Transport Connection-mode Service or Transport
Connectionless-mode Service may be made available to mOSI users: e.g\&. the options for Quality of
service.  The quality of service parameters are passed directly by the OSI Upper Layers to the
Transport Layer.  These options can thus be used to specify OSI Upper Layers quality of service
parameters via XTI.  This facility is implementation dependent and an attempt to specify an
unsupported option will return with the status field set to \fBT_NOTSUPPORT\fP.  None of these
options are available with an ISO-over-TCP (RFC 1006)

.SH FUNCTIONS
.PP
Functions rcvreldata() (see t_rcvreldata) and sndreldata() (see t_sndreldata) were introducted as
part of this XTI-mOSI functionality.  The rationale for this is that for ISO ACSE providing an
orderly release mechanism, user data is a parameter of the release service, so when mapping XTI
primitives to ACSE/Presentation (XTI-mOSI), disconnection user data may be received from peer
applications.  Although abortive release primitives (t_snddis, t_rcvdis) permit sending and
receiving user data, orderly release primitives (t_sndrel, t_rcvrel) do not.  Therefore, new
functions having a user data parameter t_rcvreldata() and t_sndreldata() were added to provide the
necessary support to handle this user data.
.TP
.BR t_accept (3)
If \fIfd\fP is not equal to \fIresfd\fP, \fIresfd\fP should either be in state \fBT_UNBND\fP or be
in state \fBT_IDLE\fP with the \fIqlen\fP parameter set to zero (0).
.sp
The \fIaddr\fP parameter passed to/returned from \fBt_bind\fP(3) when \fIresfd\fP is bound may be
different from the \fIaddr\fP parameter corresponding to \fIfd\fP.

optionally the local AP Title, AE Qualifier, AP and AE invocation-identifiers (see
\*(lq\fIOPTIONS\fP,\*(rq for more details).
.sp
This local \fIaddr\fP field is used, depending on the XTI primitive, as the calling, called or
responding address, the called address being different from the responding address only when two
different file descriptors (\fIfd\fP, \fIresfd\fP), bound to different addressess, are used.
.TP
.BR t_close (3)
Any connections that are still active at the endpoint are abnormally terminated.  The peer

The \fIsndcall->addr\fP structure specifies the Called Presentation Address.  The
\fIrcvcall->addr\fP structure specifies the Responsing Presentation Address.  The structure may also
be used to assign values for the Called AP Title, Called AE Qualifier, Called AP
invocation-identifier and Called AE invocation-identifier.

.I Session:
Kernel, Full Duplex, Version 2, or Version 1 if Version 2 not supported, no segmentation.

Other session protocol mechanisms are out of scope, except Basic Concatenation which is mandatory
and transparent to the application.

If invalid (non-negotiable) options are requested by the peer and detected by the provider once the
association is already established (such as the ACSE presentation context missing in the Defined
Context Set), the association is rejected via a A-(P)-ABORT generated by the implementation.

.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
If the Local Presentation Address is not passed to \fBt_bind\fP(3) in \fIreq->addr\fP, then it is
returned in \fIret->addr\fP.
.IP \(bu
The remove (called) Presentation Address (in \fBt_connect\fP(3), \fIsndcall->addr\fP) parameter must
be explicity set by the application.
.IP \(bu
The following parameters are mandatory for the protocol machine, but default values are provided.
If the application does not wish to set the corresponding parameter, the default value will be used.
The default value may be changed through \fBt_optmgmt\fP(3) (see \*(lq\fIOptions\fP\*(rq):
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Application Context Name (\fIopt\fP parameter).
.IP \(bu
Presentation Context List (\fIopt\fP parameter).
.sp
The presentation context of ACSE is required and used.  The user should not request it as the
implementation will insert it automatically in the context list.
.sp
If the user does not specifically request an Application Context Name via the \fIopt\fP parameter of
\fBt_accept\fP(3) (that is, for the A-ASSOCIATE.response), the implementation uses the Application
Context Name that was received in the A-ASSOCIATE.indication.

.IP \(bu
The following parameters are optional for the protocol and default values of null are defined.  If
the application does not set them otherwise, they are ommitted from the outgoing protocol stream.

During association establishment (that is, before the XTI-mOSI provider negotiates acceptance of a
single abstract syntax/transfer syntax pair), an XTI-mOSI application initiating the association
will only send a single presentation data value in the user information parameter.  The XTI-mOSI
provider will insure that the first abstract syntax and transfer syntax pari being negotiated is the
one required for its encoding.
