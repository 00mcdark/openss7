Application Context Name
.sp
An application context name identifies a set of tasks to be performed by an
application.  It is exchanged during association establishment with the
purpose
of conveying a common
understanding of the work to be done.
.sp
This parameter is exposed to offer some negotiation capabilities to the
application and to
increase the chances of interoperability.
.sp
When receiving a non suitable or unknown value from a peer application, the
application
may propose an alternate value or decide to terminate prematurely the
association.
.sp
A default value (in the form of an Object Identifier) is provided, identifying
a generic XTImOSI
application. Its value can be found in XNS
.[
xns99
.]
Section H.5 on page 313.
.IP \(bu
Presentation Contexts
.sp
A presentation context is the association of an abstract syntax with a
transfer syntax. The presentation context is used by the application to
identify how the data is structured and by the OSI Application Layer to
identify how the data should be encoded/decoded.
.sp
A generic presentation context is defined for a stream-oriented, unstructured,
data transfer service with
.I null
encoding:
.[
rfc1085
.]
.sp
.IR abstract\0syntax :
The single data type of this abstract syntax is a sequence of octets that are
defined in the application protocol specification as being consecutive octets
on a stream-oriented transport mechanism, without regard for any semantic or
other boundaries.
.sp
.IR transfer\0syntax :
The data value shall be represented as an octet-aligned presentation data
value. If two or more data values are concatenated together they are
considered to be a single (longer) data value. (This is the
.I null
encoding rule).
.sp
The value of the Object Identifiers for this generic presentation context can
be found in
XNS
.[
xns99
.]
Section H.5 on page 313.
.IP \(bu
Presentation Context Definition and Result List, Defined Context Set
.sp
As negotiation occurs between the peer OSI Application layers, the
presentation context(s) proposed by the application may not be accepted.
.sp
The Presentation Context Definition and Result List indicates, for each of the
proposed presentation context, if it is accepted or, if not, provides a reason
code; the application may choose to terminate the association prematurely if
it does not suit its requirements.

.SH FUNCTIONS
.PP
Functions rcvreldata() (see t_rcvreldata) and sndreldata() (see t_sndreldata)
were introducted as part of this XTI-mOSI functionality.  The rationale for
this is that for ISO ACSE providing an orderly release mechanism, user data is
a parameter of the release service, so when mapping XTI primitives to
ACSE/Presentation (XTI-mOSI), disconnection user data may be received from
peer applications.  Although abortive release primitives (t_snddis, t_rcvdis)
permit sending and receiving user data, orderly release primitives (t_sndrel,
t_rcvrel) do not.  Therefore, new functions having a user data parameter
t_rcvreldata() and t_sndreldata() were added to provide the necessary support
to handle this user data.
.TP
.BR t_accept (3)
If \fIfd\fP is not equal to \fIresfd\fP, \fIresfd\fP should either be in state
\fBT_UNBND\fP or be in state \fBT_IDLE\fP with the \fIqlen\fP parameter set to
zero (0).
.sp
The \fIaddr\fP parameter passed to/returned from \fBt_bind\fP(3) when
\fIresfd\fP is bound may be different from the \fIaddr\fP parameter
corresponding to \fIfd\fP.
.sp
The \fIopt\fP parameter may be used to change the Application Context Name
received.
.TP
.BR t_alloc (3)
No special considerations for mOSI providers.
.TP
.BR t_bind (3)
The \fIaddr\fP field of the \fBt_bind\fP structure represents the local
presentation address and optionally the local AP Title, AE Qualifier, AP and
AE invocation-identifiers (see \*(lq\fIOPTIONS\fP,\*(rq for more details).
.sp
This local \fIaddr\fP field is used, depending on the XTI primitive, as the
calling, called or responding address, the called address being different from
the responding address only when two different file descriptors (\fIfd\fP,
\fIresfd\fP), bound to different addressess, are used.
.TP
.BR t_close (3)
Any connections that are still active at the endpoint are abnormally
terminated.  The peer applications will be informed of the disconnection by a
.RB [ T_DISCONNECT ]
event.  The value of the disconnection reason will be \fBT_AC_ABRT_NSPEC\fP.
.TP
.BR t_connect (3)
The \fIsndcall->addr\fP structure specifies the Called Presentation Address.
The \fIrcvcall->addr\fP structure specifies the Responsing Presentation
Address.  The structure may also be used to assign values for the Called AP
Title, Called AE Qualifier, Called AP invocation-identifier and Called AE
invocation-identifier.
.sp
Before the call, the \fIsndcall->opt\fP structure may be used to request an
Application Context Name or Presentation Context different from the default
value.
.TP
.BR t_error (3)
No special considerations for mOSI providers.
.TP
.BR t_free (3)
No special considerations for mOSI providers.
.TP
.BR t_getinfo (3)
The information supported by \fBt_getinfo\fP(3) reflects the characteristics
of the transport connection, or if no connection is established, the default
characteristics of the underlying OSI layers.  In all possible states except
\fBT_DATAXFER\fP, the function \fBt_getinfo\fP(3) returns in the parameter
\fIinfo\fP the same information as was returned by \fBt_open\fP(3).  In state
\fBT_DATAXFER\fP, however, the information returned in \fIinfo->connect\fP and
\fIinfo->discon\fP may differ.
.sp
The parameter of the \fBt_getinfo\fP(3) function are summarized in the table

.sp
The values returned in \fIinfo->connect\fP and \fIinfo->discon\fP in state
\fBT_DATAXFER\fP may differ from the value returned by \fBt_open\fP(3):
negotiation takes place during association establishment and, as a result,
these values may be reduced.  For \fIinfo->connect\fP, this change of value
may be indicated by the provider, but is of little use to the application.

mOSI does not support the sending of TSDUs of zero length, so this value

.BR t_rcvudata (3)
The \fIunitdata->addr\fP structure specifies the remote Presentation Address,
