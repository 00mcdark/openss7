The original, which remains accessible.
.TP
.IR rules "\0\fBRules\fP(Object Identifier)
Identifies the set of rules that the service is to follow to produce the

specific to the encoding class.

.IR encoding "\0\fBEncoding\fP(Private Object)
The encoding, and instance of class Encoding, which is created in the
original's workspace.  This result is present if, and only if, the Return Code
result is success

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR om_encode ()
function creates a new private object, the encoding, that exactly and
independently encodes an existing private object, the original.  The client
identifiers the set of rules that the service is to follow to produce the
encoding.
.PP
The definition of a package identifies zero or more of its concrete classes to
which this function applies.  Thus the function will encode instances of those
classes.  If will also encode instances of zero or more additional concrete
classes in the package.  The identities of these latter classes are
implementation-defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, the zero value of
.RB [ OM_SUCCESS ]
is returned. Otherwise, a non-zero diagnostic error value is returned.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR om_encode ()
fails, it returns a non-zero error code, as follows:
.TP
.RB [ OM_FUNCTION_DECLINED ]
The function does not apply to the object to which it is addressed.
.TP
.RB [ OM_FUNCTION_INTERRUPTED ]
The function was aborted by an external force (for example, a keystroke,
designated for this purpose, at a user interface).
.TP
.RB [ OM_MEMORY_INSUFFICIENT ]
The service cannot allocate the main memory it needs to complete the function.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NETWORK_ERROR ]
The service could not successfully employ the network upon which its
implementation depends.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NO_SUCH_OBJECT ]
A purported object is nonexistent or the purported handle is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NO_SUCH_RULES ]
A purported rules identifier is undefined.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NOT_PRIVATE ]
An object is public, not private.
.TP
.RB [ OM_PERMANENT_ERROR ]
The service encountered a permanent difficulty other than those denoted by
other return codes.
.TP
.RB [ OM_POINTER_INVALID ]
In the C inteface, an invalid pointer was supplied as a function argument or as
the receptacle for a function result.
.TP
.RB [ OM_SYSTEM_ERROR ]
The service could not successfully employ the operating system upon which its
implementation depends.
.TP
.RB [ OM_TEMPORARY_ERROR ]
The service encountered a temporary difficulty other than those denoted by
other return codes.
.PP
Other arguments passed to or returned by the function are unaffected.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

.BR om_encode ()
is compatible with

and implementations based on
XOM,
.[

with the following portability considerations:

Note that many add-on OSI packages for popular UNIX SVR 4.2 based releases
provided the XOM interface and the associated set of X/Open, IEEE and ISO
standard interfaces.
.IP \(em
The function is source compatible only.  Binary compatibility was not
attempted.
