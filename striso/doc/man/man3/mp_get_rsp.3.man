.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to reply to a previously invoked Get operation or Get-next operation.  This
function can only be called in synchronous mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
The management session against which this operation is performed.
This must be a private object previously returned from
.BR mp_bind (3).
.TP
.I context
The management context to be used for this operation.
This argument must be a private object or the contant
.RB ( MP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT ).
.TP
.I response
The information supplied as response to a Get or Get-next operation.  For a CMIS Get operation, the
response is one of the following:
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
When a Get is performed on no objectes, this is specified by the constant
.RB ( MP_ABSENT_OBJECT )
as the response.
.IP \(bu
When a Get is performed on a single object, this is indicated by one instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_GET_RESULT }
as the response.
.IP \(bu
When a Get is performed on multiple objects, this is indicated by one or more
.BR mp_get_rsp ()
calls, one for each selected object, followed by a final \*(lqempty\*(rq
.BR mp_get_rsp ().
Each
.BR mp_get_rsp ()
call includes a response that contains an instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_LINKED_REPLY_ARGUMENT }.
Each instance contains exactly one of the following OM attributes:
.RS
.TP
.RB [ MP_GET_RESULT ]
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ MP_GET_LIST_ERROR ]
.TP
.RB [ MP_PROCESSING_FAILURE ]
.PD
.PP
The final \*(lqempty\*(rq
.BR mp_get_rsp ()
call includes a response that contains only the constant
.RB ( MP_ABSENT_OBJECT ).
.RE
.IP \(bu
An instance of the OM class
.BR { MP_C_CMIS_SERVICE_ERROR }
or
.BR { MP_C_CMIS_SERVICE_REJECT }
indicates the failure of the operations, except the operation cancelled error indication which
completes (cancels) the operation.
.sp
The following
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_SERVICE_ERRORS }
including the problem cause and its associated parameter may be returned:
.RS

For an SNMP Get operation or Get-next operation, the response is an instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_PDUS }.
The single OM attribute
.RB [ MP_VARIABLE_BINDINGS ]
contains the list of variables and their values which were read.  The single OM attribute
.RB [ MP_ERROR_STATUS ]
indicates one of the following errors:
.RB [ MP_E_GEN_ERR ],
.RB [ MP_E_NO_SUCH_NAME ],
.RB [ MP_E_TOO_BIG ].
