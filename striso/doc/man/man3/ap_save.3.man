.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xap.h>
.br
.BI "in ap_save(int " fd ", FILE *" savef ", unsigned long *" aperrno_p );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
A file descriptor that identifies the XAP instance.
.TP
.I savef
A file pointer representing the open file stream to which to save the XAP
instance.
.TP
.I aperrno_p
A pointer to a memory element into which to receive an error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Used in conjunction with
.BR ap_restore (3),
this function provides a way for cooperating processes to share an instance of
XAP.  The
.BR ap_save ()
function writes a \(lqsnapshot\(rq of XAP instance identified by
.IR fd ,
to the file identified by
.IR savef .
Included in the saved information are the values of all XAP environment
attributes and any internal state information needed to recreate this XAP
instance: see
.BR ap_restore (3).
.PP
.I savef
must have been opened for writing.  The
.BR ap_save ()
function begins writing from the current position in the file and does not
close
.I savef
when it finishes.
.PP
The
.BR ap_save ()
function does not directly support any form of process coordination.  However,
the user can, for example, use the file permission and file and record locking
capabilities of the operating system with the save file to facilitate
coordination of cooperating processes sharing a single XAP instance.
.PP
.I aperrno_p
must be set to point to a location which will be used to carry an error code
back to the user.
.\"
.\"
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
See
.BR ap_env (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero
.RB ( 0 )
is returned.  Otherwise, a value of minus one
.RB ( -1 )
is returned and the location pointed to by
.I aperrno_p
is set to indicate the error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.TP
.RB [ AP_BADF ]
The
.I fd
parameter does not identify an XAP instance.
.TP
.RB [ AP_BADSAVE ]
The environment cannot be saved because the current environment is being used
to send or receive data (i.e., utilizing the
.B AP_MORE
bit).
.TP
.RB [ AP_BADSAVEF ]
.I savef
was opened improperly.
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOENV ]
There is no XAP environment associated with
.IR fd .
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOT_SUPPORTED ]
The
.BR ap_save ()
operattion is not supported by this implementation of XAP.
.PP
In addition, operating system class errors are reported.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The OpenSS7 XAP Library and cooperating modules and drivers implement the XAP
environment attributes as XTI options and using input-output controls.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

is compatible with XAP,

and implementations based on XAP, such as
.IR "Solaris SUnLink" \(rg

Only source compatibility is attempted.
Binary compatibility is not
attempted: any exhibited binary compatibility is coincidental and is scheduled
to be removed on the next release.
See

and
.BR XAP (3)
for additional compatibility considerations.
