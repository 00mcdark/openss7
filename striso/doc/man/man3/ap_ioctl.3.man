.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function controls the generation of software interrupts for the XAP instance identified by
.IR fd .
.PP
Software interrupt is an asynchronous mechanism that can be used to inform an application of pending
events or state changes for a service that it is using. An XAP implementation may use such a mechanism
to inform the XAP user about incoming events such as a primitive available to be received, or outgoing
events such as a flow control restriction being lifted. This mechanism is complementary to the
.BR ap_poll (3)
function which provides synchronous notification of such events.
.PP
Support for software interrupt and the mechanism by which such an interrupt is signalled to the XAP
user is a feature of the operating system platform on which the XAP implementation runs.  XAP does not
define a software interrupt interface mechanism itself. Further, support for the function provided by
.BR ap_ioctl ()
is not a mandatory part of XAP and if not available,
.BR ap_ioctl ()
returns
.RB [ AP_NOT_SUPPORTED ].
Therefore a portable application should not rely on provision of this mechanism.
.PP
If the user requires software interrupts to be generated when a data event occurs, then
.BR ap_ioctl ()
should be called with a
.I request
parameter of
.BR AP_SETPOLL .
The
.I l
member of the
.B ap_val_t
.I argument
parameter is a bitmask used to indicate which events should generate a software interrupt. All XAP
Library implementations recognise the following events:
.TP \w'\fBAP_POLLWRBAND\fR\(em'u
.B AP_POLLRDNORM
Data (for example, an XAP Library primitive or user data associated with an XAP Library primitive) has
arrived on the normal data flow and is available to be read.
.TP
.B AP_POLLRDBAND
Data has arrived outside the normal data flow and is available to be read. In implementations that do
not support multiple data bands, this event will result in the same action as the
.B AP_POLLRDNORM
event.
.TP
.B AP_POLLIN
Data has arrived (on either band) and is available to be read.
.TP
.B AP_POLLOUT
Data can be sent on the normal priority band.
.TP
.B AP_POLLWRNORM
The same as AP_POLLOUT.
.TP
.B AP_POLLWRBAND
Out-of-band data can be sent. This event will be treated as
.B AP_POLLOUT
in implementations that do not support multiple data bands.
.PP
Support for events other than those listed above is optional. Users interested in developing
applications that are portable across different XAP Library implementations should keep this caveat in
mind.
.PP
If the user requires software interrupts to be disabled then
.BR ap_ioctl ()
should be called with a
.I request
parameter of
.BR AP_SETPOLL
and the
.I l
member of the
.B ap_val_t
.I argument
value as 0.
.PP
If the user wishes to obtain the current settings of the software interrupts bitmask then
.BR ap_ioctl ()
should be called with a
.I request
parameter of
.BR AP_GETPOLL .
The
.I v
member of the
.B ap_val_t
.I argument
must point to a location where the current setting of the bitmask is to be written by
.BR ap_ioctl ().
.PP
.I aperrno_p
must be set to point to a location which will be used to carry an error code back to the user.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero
.RB ( 0 )
is returned. Otherwise, a value of
minus one
.RB ( -1 )
is returned and the location pointed to by
.I aperrno_p
is set to indicate the error.

.SH ERRORS
.TP \w'[\fBAP_NOT_SUPPORTED\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ AP_BADF ]
The
.I fd
paramter does not identify an XAP instance.
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOT_SUPPORTED ]
.BR ap_ioctl ()
operation is not supported by this implementation of XAP.

In addition, operating system class errors are reported.
