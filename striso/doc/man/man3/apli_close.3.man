.SH NAME
.B ap_close
\- close an APLI instance.

.SH INTERFACE
.PP
ACSE/Presentation Library Interface (APLI).

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the file descriptor associated with the instance to close.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function frees the resources allocated to support the serivce provider identified by the file
descriptor,
.IR fd .
It must be called to terminate each APLI isntance created using the
.BR ap_open (3)
function.
.PP
If the STREAM identified by
.I fd
is shared by more than one APLI instance, it remains open until the last open file descriptor is
closed.  If the APLI instance is closed while an association is still active, the association is
aborted before the resources are released.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success, a value of zero (0) is returned; otherwise, minus one (-1) is returned and
.BR ap_errno (3)
is set to indicate the cause of the error.  The corresponding error message is returned by calling
the
.BR ap_error (3)
function.

.SH ERRORS
