.SH NAME

\- write a TSAP into a \fBnetbuf\fP(3) structure
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.br
.B #include <osi.h>
.HP
.BI "int tsap2net(int " net_len ", char *" net ", char *" nsap ", char *" tsel ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I net_len
the length of the
.BR netbuf (3)
structure.
.TP
.I net
points to the
.BR netbuf (3)
structure into which to place the TSAP address, of length
.IR net_len .
.TP
.I nsap
points to the NSAP to place in the buffer.
.TP
.I tsel
points to the TSEL to place in the buffer.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B tsap2net ()
places the TSAP that results from combining the NSAP pointed to by the
.I nsap
argument with the TSEL pointed to by the
.I tsel
argument into the
.BR netbuf (3)
structure pointed to by the
.I net
argument of length
.I net_len
octets.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When successful,
.BR tsap2net ()
returns the positive length of the buffer in octets;
when unsuccessful, minus one
.RB ( -1 ).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When unsuccessful,
.BR tsap2net ()
returns minus one,
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
The arguments to this function do not make any sense whatsoever.  This is the
fault of Sun's specification of the function and not the implementation of it.
Why one would transfer
.BI sizeof( "struct netbuf" )
as an argument escapes me.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following example demonstrates placing the TSAP in a netbuf and using it
to bind a
.BR /dev/clnp
Stream:
.\"
.\"
.SH FILES
.PP

.TP

function.

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR tsap2net ()
is compatible with
.I SunLink OSI
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
This function is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that is implemented by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
to assist with porting
.I SunLink OSI
applications programs to
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.IP ""
.BR tsap2net ()
will not be used by portable programs.
.IP \(em
Although not POSIX, the Sun TI-RPC function
.BR uaddr2taddr (3)
is probably more portable.
.IP ""
.BR tsap2net ()
will not be used by portable programs.
.PP
See
.BR libosi (3),
for additional compatibility information.
