.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSING
.PP
Addressing varies according to whether one is using the XTI/TLI above OSI
Transport,
.[
x214
.]
.[
x224
.]
.[
x234
.]
above RFC 1006,
.[
rfc1006
.]
or above CLNS.
.[
x233
.]
.\"
.\"
.SS Transport Layer Addressing
.PP
The TSAP, which identifies the transport provider, can be coded in hexadecimal
or as a character string.  A TSAP is formed from the TSEL followed by the NSAP.
The TSEL in the address is preceded by a 1 octet TSEL length, and the NSAP in
the address is preceded by a 1 octet NSAP length.
.\"
.\"
.SS RFC1006 Addressing
.PP
Addessing for RFC 1006
.[
rfc1006
.]
applications is formatted in the same way as that for transport layer
applications, described above.  When using the
.BR t_connect (3)
function, the NSAP is replaced by a 4 octet IP address.  When using the
.BR t_bind (3)
function, the NSAP takes the value \*(lq\fBrk6\fP\*(rq.
.\"
.\"
.SS CLNS Addressing
.PP
The NSAP, which identifies the network provider, can be coded in hexadecimal
or as a characeter stirng.  An NSAP is formed from the NSAP preceved by a 1
octet NSAP length.
.\"
.\"
.SH FUNCTIONS
.\"
.SS t_bind\fR(3)
.PP
.I req->addr
specifies the TSAP address.  The format of the TSAP address is described above
under
.RI \*(lq ADDRESSING .\*(rq
Note that hwne interfacing to RFC1006,
.[
rfc1006
.]
the value for the NSAP field is \*(lq\fBrk6\fP\*(rq.
.PP
OSI supports both connection-oriented and connectionless mode protocols.
As each uses a different NSAP, the TSAP address for connection and
connectionless networks are different.  Therefore, the trasnport class (TC 0,
1, 2, 3 and 4 over CONS, and TC 4 over CLNS) is selected after the endpoint
has been bound.
.SS t_close\fR(3)
.PP
No OSI provider-specific considerations.
.SS t_connect\fR(3)
.PP
.I sndcall->addr
specifies the TSAP address of the destination transport user.  Note that if
you are interfacing to RFC1006,
.[
rfc1006
.]
the NSAP is replaced by a 4 octet IP address.  Refer to
.RI \*(lq ADDRESSING ,\*(rq
above.
.SS t_error\fR(3)
.PP
No OSI provider-specific considerations.
.SS t_free\fR(3)
.PP
No OSI provider-specific considerations.
.SS t_getinfo\fR(3)
.PP
No OSI provider-specific considerations.
.SS t_getstate\fR(3)
.PP
No OSI provider-specific considerations.
.SS t_listen\fR(3)
.PP
.I call->addr
returns the TSAP of the calling transport user.
.SS t_look\fR(3)
.PP
No OSI provider-specific considerations.
.SS t_open\fR(3)

Note that the
.BR clnp (4)
device,
.BR /dev/clnp ,
is really the CLNS device,
.BR /dev/clns
with an autopush specification for the
.BR clnstpi (4)
module, which converts between the native NPI interface of the OSI CLNS
.[
x213
.]
and the TPI interface.  This is for providing for XTI/TLI applications that
run directly over CLNP.
