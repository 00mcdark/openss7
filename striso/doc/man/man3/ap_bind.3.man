.SH NAME

\- Bind a Presentation Address to an XAP Instance
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xap.h>
.HP
.BI "int ap_bind(int " fd ", unsigned long *" aperrno_p );
.\"

.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function associates the Presentation Address stored in the
.B AP_BIND_PADDR
environment vairable witht he XAP Instances specified by
.IR fd .
Upon successful completion the service provider may begin enqueueing incoming
associations or sending outbound associations requests.  All necessary
environment variables (e.g.
.BR AP_BIND_PADDR ,
.BR AP_ROLE_ALLOWED )
should be set prior to calling
.BR ap_bind ().
.PP
When this function is called, an attempt may be made to bind to the specified
address.  As a part of the bind procedure, an authroization check may be
performed to verify that all of the processes that share this XAP instance are
authorized to use the new address.  If all are authorized to do so, the bind
request will succeed and the XAP instance may be used to send (receive)
primitives from (addressed to) the new address.  Successfully calling this
function causes the state of XAP to move from
.BR AP_UNBOUND " to " AP_IDLE .
.PP
Some implementations may perform not authorization checking.  In this case the
.RB [ AP_ACCES ]
error response will not be returned.  Other implementations may defer binding
and authorization until a
.BR A_ASSOC_REQ " or " A_ASSOC_RSP
primtive is issued.  In this case, if the authorization check failes, the
.RB [ AP_ACCES ]
error will be returned by
.BR ap_snd (3).
The local address can be changed to an acceptable value and the primitive
reissued, or the connection can be closed.
.PP
An instance can be bound to a presentation address only if all of the processes
that share it are authorized to use the requested address.  Consequently, when
an attempt is made to bind an address, the effective UIDs of all of the
processes that share this instance of XAP may be checked against the list of
users allowed to use the requested address. If all are authorised to use the
address,
.BR ap_bind ()
succeeds and the instance is bound to the specified presentation address. On the
other hand, if any of the processes is not authorised to use the requested
address,
.BR ap_bind ()
fails and the instance remains unbound.
.I aperrno_p
must be set to point to a location which will be used to carry an error code
back to the user.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero
.RB ( 0 )
is returned. Otherwise, a value of
minus one
.RB ( -1 )
is returned and the location pointed to by
.I aperrno_p
is set to indicate the error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.RB [ AP_ACCES ]
Request to bind to specified address denied.
.TP
.RB [ AP_BADF ]
The
.I fd
paramter does not identify an XAP instance.
.TP
.RB [ AP_BADNSAP ]
The format of the NSAP portion of the Presentation Address is not supported.
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOENV ]
There is no XAP environment associated with
.IR fd .
