.SH NAME
.B ap_get_env
\- Get the value of an XAP environment attribute.

.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xap.h>
.HP
.BI "int ap_get_env(int " fd ", unsigned long " attr ", void *" val ", unsigned long *" aperrno_p );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP \w'\fIaperrno_p\fR\(em'u
.I fd
A file descriptor that identifies the XAP instance.
.TP
.I attr
An attribute identifier.
.TP
.I val
A pointer to a memory extent into which to receive the value.
.TP
.I aperrno_p
A pointer to a memory extent into which to receive an error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function retrieves the value of an environment attribute for an XAP
instance identified by
.IR fd .
.I attr
is used to pass the name of the attribute to be retrieved, defined by the
associated
.B #define
in the
.RB < xap.h >
header file.
.PP
The value supplied as the
.I val
argument to this function depends upon which attribute is to be examined. In
all cases,
.I val
must point to an object of the same type as the specified attribute. For
example, if the type of the attribute is
.BR long ,
.I val
must point to a
.BR long .
Similarly, if the type of the
attribute is
.BR ap_dcs_t ,
.I val
must point to an
.B ap_dcs_t
structure. If the object pointed to by
.I val
is either a pointer or a structure that includes pointers (e.g.,
.BR ap_dcs_t ),
XAP allocates additional memory by calling the user supplied or built-in
allocation routine, and assigns proper values to the pointer elements as
required. Memory allocated by
.BR ap_get_env ()
can be freed with the
.BR ap_free (3)
function.
.PP
Refer to
.BR ap_env (3)
for information about attribute types.
.PP
.I aperrno_p
must be set to point to a location which will be used to carry an error code
back to the user.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero
.RB ( 0 )
is returned. Otherwise, a value of
minus one
.RB ( -1 )
is returned and the location pointed to by
.I aperrno_p
is set to indicate the error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.TP \w'[\fBAP_NOREAD\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ AP_BADENV ]
There is no value assigned to the requested environment attribute.
.TP
.RB [ AP_BADF ]
The
.I fd
parameter does not identify an XAP instance.
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOATTR ]
The
.I attr
argument does not specify a valid attribute type.
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOENV ]
There is no XAP environment associated with
.IR fd .
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOMEM ]
XAP could not allocate sufficient memory to copy the value of the specified attribute.
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOREAD ]
The specified attribute is not readable.
.PP
In addition, operating system class errors are reported.
