.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function retrieves the value of an environment attribute for an XAP
instance identified by
.IR fd .
.I attr
is used to pass the name of the attribute to be retrieved, defined by the
associated
.B #define
in the
.RB < xap.h >
header file.
.PP
The value supplied as the
.I val
argument to this function depends upon which attribute is to be examined. In
all cases,
.I val
must point to an object of the same type as the specified attribute. For
example, if the type of the attribute is
.BR long ,
.I val
must point to a
.BR long .
Similarly, if the type of the
attribute is
.BR ap_dcs_t ,
.I val
must point to an
.B ap_dcs_t
structure. If the object pointed to by
.I val
is either a pointer or a structure that includes pointers (e.g.,
.BR ap_dcs_t ),
XAP allocates additional memory by calling the user supplied or built-in
allocation routine, and assigns proper values to the pointer elements as
required. Memory allocated by
.BR ap_get_env ()
can be freed with the
.BR ap_free (3)
function.
.PP
Refer to
.BR ap_env (3)
for information about attribute types.
.PP
.I aperrno_p
must be set to point to a location which will be used to carry an error code
back to the user.

.TP
.B AP_ACSE_AVAIL
The AP_ACSE_AVAIL attribute indicates which versions of the ACSE protocol are currently available
for the association.  The attribute is an \fBunsigned long\fP with bit values \fIAP_ACSEVER1\fP.
It is readable always and writable never, except when the AP_MODE_SEL attribute is set to
AP_X410_MODE, in which case the version "X.410-1984" is implied by the mode.
.TP
.B AP_ACSE_SEL
The AP_ACSE_SEL attribute indicates which version of the ACSE protocol is currently selected for the
association.  The attribute is an \fBunsigned long\fP with bit values \fIAP_ACSEVER1\fP and default
value \fIAP_ACSEVER1\fP.  It is readable always and writable in states \fBAP_UNBOUND\fP and
\fBAP_IDLE\fP.  In all other states, the value represents the ACSE version for the current
association.  This attribute is not applicable when AP_MODE_SEL is set to AP_X410_MODE, in which
case the version "X.410-1984" is implied by the mode.
.TP
.B AP_AFU_AVAIL
The AP_AFU_AVAIL attribute indicates which optional ACSE functional units are currently available for
use on the association.  The attribute is an \fBunsigned long\fP with bit values \fINULL\fP.  It is
readable always and writable never, except when the AP_MODE_SEL attribute is set to AP_X410_MODE, in
which case the functional units of "X.410-1984" are implied by the mode.
.TP
.B AP_AFU_SEL
The AP_AFU_SEL attribute indicates which optional ACSE functional units have been requested for use
over the current association.  The attribute is an \fBunsigned long\fP with bit values \fINULL\fP.
It is readable always and writable in states \fBAP_UNBOUND\fP, \fBAP_IDLE\fP and
\fBAP_WASSOCrsp_ASSOCind\fP.  In all other states, the value represents the selected optional ACSE
functional units for the association.  This attribute is not applicable when AP_MODE_SEL is set to
AP_X410_MODE, in which case the functional units available to "X.410-1984" is implied by the mode.

.B AP_DCS
The AP_DCS attribute is the defined context set. The defined context set contains the abstract
syntax/transfer syntax pairs that were negotiated when the association was established, together
with the presentation context identifier that identifies the pair.  The value of AP_DCS shall be
empty (size field of 0) in the states AP_IDLE and AP_WASSOCcnf_ASSOCreq, it shall contain the ACSE
context negotiated by XAP in the state AP_WASSOCrsp_ASSOCind, and it shall contain the fully
negotiated defined context set in all other states. Note that the defined context set contains both
the presentation contexts that were negotiated by the user (using AP_PCDL and AP_PCDRL) and any
additional presentation contexts that were negotiated by XAP or provider. For example, the ACSE
context (i.e., {joint-iso-ccitt 2 1 0 1}) will be negotiated automatically and will appear in the
defined context set after negotiation is complete. This attribute is not used in the X.410-1984
mode. Refer to the description of the AP_MODE_SEL attribute.
.TP
.B AP_PCDL
The AP_PCDL attribute is used to propose the list of presentation contexts to be used on the
connection. The association-initiator sets this list to indicate the contexts it wishes to use for
encoding user data on the association. Since the user is responsible for all encoding and decoding
of user data, the proposed transfer syntaxes for each proposed abstract syntax must be included in
the list proposed by the association-initiator user. For the association-responder, the list
indicates which presentation contexts are being requested by the association-initiator for use on
the association. The association-initiator may specify the ACSE context in AP_PCDL, although it is
not required to do so. If the association-initiator does not supply the ACSE context in AP_PCDL, XAP
supplies it automatically for the association. Regardless of whether or not the
association-initiator supplies the ACSE context, it is not provided to the associationresponder in
AP_PCDL (the responding user may obtain it from AP_DCS if required). This attribute is not used in
the X.410-1984t mode. Refer to the description of the AP_MODE_SEL attribute.
.TP
.B AP_PCDRL
The AP_PCDRL attribute is used to indicate whether the presentation contexts proposed in the
presentation context definition list have been accepted or rejected. The associationresponder uses
this attribute to indicate which of the proposed presentation contexts are acceptable before issuing
the A_ASSOC_RSP primitive. For the association-initiator, this attribute indicates the remote userOs
response to the proposed presentation contexts, received in the A_ASSOC_CNF primitive. Each entry in
AP_PCDRL corresponds one-to-one with an entry in AP_PCDL which, in the case of the responder, never
contains the proposed ACSE context. The associationresponder has an opportunity to accept or reject
each of the proposed contexts that are indicated in AP_PCDL. The ACSE context is automatically
accepted by XAP, and appears in the value of AP_DCS. This attribute is not used in the X.410-1984
mode. Refer to the description of the AP_MODE_SEL attribute.
.TP
.B AP_DPCN
The AP_DPCN attribute is the default-context-name parameter of the CP PPDU. This attribute is not
used in the \*(lqX.410-1984\*(rq mode. Refer to the description of the AP_MODE_SEL attribute.
.TP
.B AP_DPCR
The AP_DPCR attribute is the default-context-result parameter of the CPR PPDU. Since the user is
responsible for encoding and decoding of user-data, it is the user's responsibility to accept or
reject any proposed default-presentation-context. The value, AP_DPCR_NOVAL, indicates that it is not
present. This attribute is not used in the \*(lqX.410-1984\*(rq mode.  Refer to the description of
the AP_MODE_SEL attribute.

Type \fBunsigned long\fP with bit values \fIAP_DATA_TOK\fP, \fIAP_SYNCMINOR_TOK\fP, \fIAP_MAJACT_TOK\fP, \fIAP_RELEASE_TOK\fP.
This attribute is readable in any states except \fBAP_UNBOUND\fP, \fBAP_IDLE\fP, \fBAP_WASSOCcnf_ASSOCreq\fP, \fBAP_WASSOCrsp_ASSOCind\fP and writable never.
The tokens available are affected by the settings of the \fBAP_SFU_SEL\fP attribute (see X.215).
.[
x215
.]
.sp
A token is an attribute of an association which is dynamically assigned to one user at a time. The
user that possesses a token has exclusive rights to initiate the service which that token
represents. The AP_TOKENS_AVAIL attribute indicates which tokens are available for assignment on
this association. The value of this attribute is dependent on AP_SFU_SEL.
.TP
.B AP_TOKENS_OWNED
Type \fBunsigned long\fP with bit values \fIAP_DATA_TOK\fP, \fIAP_SYNCMINOR_TOK\fP, \fIAP_MAJACT_TOK\fP, \fIAP_RELEASE_TOK\fP.
This attribute is readable in any states except \fBAP_UNBOUND\fP, \fBAP_IDLE\fP, \fBAP_WASSOCcnf_ASSOCreq\fP, \fBAP_WASSOCrsp_ASSOCind\fP and writable never.
The owned tokens are affected using the \fBP_TOKENGIVE_REQ\fP(7), \fBP_TOKENGIVE_IND\fP(7), \fBP_TOKENPLEASE_REQ\fP(7) and \fBP_TOKENPLEASE_IND\fP(7) primitives.
.sp
The AP_TOKENS_OWNED attribute indicates which available tokens (see AP_TOKENS_AVAIL) are currently
assigned to the user. The user has exclusive rights to initiate the service represented by each of
the tokens owned. The value of this attribute is affected by AP_INIT_TOKENS.
.TP
.B AP_MSTATE
If the XAP instance is awaiting additional data from the user (the last ap_snd( ) call had the
AP_MORE bit set), the AP_SNDMORE bit in AP_MSTATE is set. If there is more user data for the current
service (the last call to ap_rcv( ) returned with the AP_MORE bit set) then AP_RCVMORE bit is set.
(Note that it is possible for both bits to be set.)
.\"
.SS Library Attributes
.TP
.B AP_LIB_AVAIL
The AP_LIB_AVAIL attribute indicates which versions of XAP are available to the user.
.TP
.B AP_LIB_SEL
The AP_LIB_SEL attribute is used to indicate which version of XAP is used. This attribute must be
set before any other attributes are set or any primitives are issued.
.TP
.B AP_OPT_AVAIL
The AP_OPT_AVAIL attribute is used to indicate what optional functionality is supported in the
underlying protocol implementation. AP_XXXX_WILD indicates whether address wildcarding is supported
at the specified level. (XXXX can be NSAP, TSEL, SSEL or PSEL.) 
.TP
.B AP_QLEN
The \fBAP_QLEN\fP attribute is used to indicate the number of connection indications that will be
held by the provider when all of the connection endpoints bound for listening at \fBAP_BIND_PADDR\fP
are in use.  The user can set this attribute to request a specific queue size. The provider may
change the value if it cannot support the requested queue size or if another process bound to the
same address has already requested a larger queue. The user can determine the current queue size by
examining the value of \fBAP_QLEN\fI using \fBap_get_env\fP(3).
.TP
.B AP_COPYENV
The AP_COPYENV attribute is used to indicate whether certain environment attributes that correspond
to parameters on the A-ASSOCIATE indication and confirmation services should be returned to the user
in the cdata argument of the ap_rcv( ) function. When the value of this attribute is TRUE, these
attributes are returned via the cdata argument.  .\"
.TP
.B AP_DIAGNOSTIC
The AP_DIAGNOSTIC attribute is used to pass diagnostic details on error conditions reported by ACSE,
Presentation, Session and Transport providers, in addition to that conveyed with the A_PABORT_IND
primitive. This mechanism is used to provide descriptive text for all errors reported by XAP, and
may be used to provide additional diagnostic information (for example, errors in incoming APDUs
reported by the local ACPM, or the reason for a transport layer disconnect). It should be noted that
the information provided by this attribute is implementation dependent - that is, an implementation
may not report all of the source/reason/event combinations defined for this attribute.  However, if
an implementation does use the attribute to report diagnostic information, it must use the
classifications defined in this specification.
