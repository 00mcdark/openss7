.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to reply to a previosly invoked associate operation.  This function can only
be called in synchronous mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
The management session against which this operation is performed.  This must be a private object
previously returned from
.BR mp_bind (3).
.TP
.I context
THe maangement context to be used for this operation.  This argument must be a private object or the
constant
.RB ( MP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT ).
.TP
.I response
The information supplied in response to an associate operation.  For an associate operation, the
response is one of the following:
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
When an association is accepted, one instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_ASSOC_RESULT }
is given as the response.  The user provides negotiated ACSE parameters in this object as input to
the service provider, and also indicates that the association is to be accepted by setting the
.RB { MP_ASSOC_RESULT }
attribute to
.RB ( MP_T_ACCEPT ).
A newly connected session object is returned in the
.BR { MP_ASSOC_RESULT }
object, so this is an in/out parameter to this function.  The new
.I session
object is in a connected state, and contains the final negotiated ACSE parameters for the new
association.
.IP \(bu
When an association is to be rejected, one instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_ASSOC_RESULT }
is given as the response.  The object should have the
.RB [ MP_ASSOC_RESULT ]
attribute set to either
.RB [ MP_T_REJECT_PERMANENT ]
or
.RB [ MP_T_REJECT_TRANSIENT ].
The
.RB [ MP_ASSOC_DIAGNOSTIC ]
can also optionally be set to indicate why the reject has occurred.
.PP
A user can also abort an association attempt.  To do this, the user does not issue an
.BR mp_assoc_rsp (),
but, instead, issues a
.BR mp_abort_req (3)
using the partially connected session object that was contained within the
.RB [ MP_ASSOC_ARGUMENT ]
obtained via
.BR mp_receive (3).
.RE
.TP
.I invoke_id
The invoke identifier of the requested operation to which the reply applies.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.I status
Indicates whether or not the associate response was completed.
