##
## Configuration file for STREAMS device drivers
##
## The built-in STREAMS drivers are configured in this file.  External
## binary packages are configured in /usr/src/linux/drivers/streams/pkg
## (see the Makefile in that directory and the one above it).
##
## Driver specifications
##
## multiple major numbers for a driver may be allocated two ways:
## . by explicitly requesting n-majors (see below)
## . by requesting an n-minors value large enough to require more than
##   one major number.
##
## strconf now supports allocating multiple major numbers, but
## not all drivers do.  It is only known to work for 'fifo' at this time.
##
##	name		prefix	major	n-minors  n-majors
driver	clns		clns	*
driver	tp		tp	*
driver	x25-lapb	lapb	*
driver	x25-plp		plp	*

##
## Object name specifications
##
##	type	name		object name
objname	driver	clns		clns
objname	driver	tp		tp
objname	driver	x25-lapb	x25_lapb
objname	driver	x25-plp		x25_plp

##
## Autopush specifications
##
## These are just stupid examples
##
##         driver          minor lastminor  modules
##autopush clone-drvr          1         0  relay
##autopush clone-drvr          2         5  relay2
##autopush link-drvr          -1         0  relay relay2

##
## Loadable specifications
##
## If you do not have a system with support for demand-loading modules
## into the kernel, you will have to load these modules by hand or in
## the startup scripts.
## If you do not use the loadable keyword at all, everything is linked
## into streams.o.
##
loadable    clns
loadable    tp
loadable    x25_lapb
loadable    x25_plp

##
## Initialization specifications
##
##initialize clone-drvr
##initialize fifo
##initialize link-drvr
##initialize loop-around

##
## Termination specifications
##
##terminate fifo
##terminate loop-around

##
## Node specifications
##
## Loop driver now makes its own nodes in its init routine as an 
## example of how to use lis_mknod.
##
##	name	          type	perm	major		minor
node	/dev/clns	    c	0666	clns		0
