						"This class represents an assignment relationship between the termination point 
						or GTP object listed in the From Termination attribute and the termination point 
						or GTP objects listed in the To Termination attributes of the contained 
						crossConnection managed objects.
						A multipoint cross-connection can be established between one of CTP Sink, CTP 
						Bidirectional, TTP Source, TTP Bidirectional, or GTP; and a set whose members 
						are CTP Source, CTP Bidirectional, TTP Sink, TTP Bidirectional, or GTP.
						The fromTermination attribute will always be non-NULL. The termination point or 
						GTP object pointed to by the fromTermination attribute is related to all the 
						termination point or GTP objects pointed to by the toTermination attribute of 
						the contained crossConnection managed objects in such a way that traffic can 
						flow between the termination points represented by these managed objects.
						Information flows from the From Termination to the To Termination of the 
						contained cross-connection objects.
						If the objects listed in the fromTermination attribute and in the toTermination 
						attribute of the contained crossConnection objects are GTPs, the nth element of 
						the From Termination GTP is related to the nth element of the To Termination GTP 
						(for every n).
						The total rate of the From Terminations must be equal to the total rate of To 
						Terminations in each contained crossConnection object.
						The attribute Signal Type describes the signal that is cross-connected. The 
						termination points or GTPs that are cross-connected must have signal types that 
						are compatible.
						The following are the definitions of the administrative state and the 
						operational state attributes:
						Administrative State:
						- Unlocked: The mpCrossConnection object is administratively unlocked. It allows 
						  traffic to pass through each contained connection depending on its 
						  administrative state.
						- Locked: No traffic is allowed to pass through the Cross-Connection between the 
						  cross-connected termination points. The effect of this value overrides the 
						  effect of the administrative state of each contained cross-connection.
						Operational State:
						The operational state of a Multipoint Cross-Connection object reflects the 
						overall health of the cross- connection including all the Cross-Connection 
						objects contained in the Multipoint Cross-Connection.
						- Enabled: The Cross-Connection is performing its normal function. Note that 
						  some (but not all) of the cross-connection objects contained in the Multipoint 
						  Cross-Connection may be disabled.
						- Disabled: The Cross-Connection is incapable of performing its normal 
						  cross-connection function. All the cross-connection objects contained in the 
						  Multipoint Cross-Connection are disabled.
						Availability Status:
						The supported values for this attribute are:
						- In test
						- Degraded: The Multipoint Cross-Connection is degraded in some respect. For 
						  instance, if one or more (but not all) Cross-Connection objects contained in 
						  the Multipoint Cross-Connection are disabled, the Multipoint Cross-Connection 
						  will be considered as degraded. The Multipoint Cross-Connection remains 
						  available for service (i.e. its operational state is enabled) while it is 
						  degraded.

					DEFINED AS
						"This managed object represents a termination point where a trail is originated. 
						It represents the access point in a layer network which is a focus for both the 
						trail relationship and the client/server relationship.
						The operational state reflects the perceived ability to generate a valid signal. 
						If the termination point detects that a valid signal cannot be generated, then 
						the operational state will have the value disabled.
						When the administrative state is locked, the termination point is 
						administratively removed from service. When the administrative state is 
						unlocked, the termination point is administratively in service. Changes to 
						administrative state have no effect on the connectivity pointer.
						A change in the operational state shall cause a state change notification. If 
						administrative state is present in an instance of trail termination point source 
						class, it shall not emit a state change notification. However, subclasses of 
						trail termination point source class may modify this behaviour to require this 
						notification. Subclasses of trail termination point source shall specify the 
						attributes for which attribute value change notifications should be generated.
						The downstream connectivity pointer attribute points to the termination point 
						managed object, within the same managed element, that receives information 
						(traffic) from this termination point at the same layer, or is null. The 
						referenced object shall be an instance of one of the following classes or its 
						subclasses: Connection Termination Point Source or Bidirectional (single or a 
						concatenated sequence or a set if connected to more than one connection 
						termination point source objects) or Trail Termination Point Sink or

bridgeRollBeh BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		"This action is used to control the bridge and roll process. This process is used 
		to move a signal from one leg of an existing cross-connection to new leg.
		The results of a bridge and roll operation take one of two forms:
		- bridgeRollFailed, which indicates that the requested operation was not 
		  successful. This response uses the same logicalProblems as the connect action 
		  of the fabric to report problems with the creation of a bridge. When the 
		  requested action cannot be performed because the identified termination points 
		  are not part of the connection, the logicalProblem notAlreadyConnected is 
		  used.
		- bridgeRollComplete, which indicates that the requested operation was 
		  successful.
		For a bridge operation, the manager must specify the affected cross-connection, 
		the termination point of that cross-connection that is to be replaced 
		(bridgeRollFromTp), and the new termination point that will replace it 
		(bridgeRollToTp). The results of the bridge operation depend on the type of 
		cross-connection:
		- if the connection is bidirectional, or the connection is unidirectional 
		  point-to-point and the bridgeRollFromTp is the toTermination of the 
		  crossConnection, the bridge operation will bridge the signal to the new leg, 
		  causing the creation of a new one-way crossConnection. If the operation is 
		  successful, the bridgeRollComplete field indicates the newly created 
		  crossConnection.
		- if the connection is unidirectional point-to-multipoint, and the 
		  bridgeRollFromTp is the toTermination of the crossConnection, the bridge 
		  operation will result in the addition of another leg to the multicast. If the 
		  operation is successful, the bridgeRollComplete field indicates the newly 
		  created crossConnection.
		- if the connection is unidirectional (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint), 
		  and the bridgeRollFromTp is the fromTermination of the connection, the bridge 
		  operation will reserve the bridgeRollToTp for use (if the network element 
		  supports such resource reservation), but will not cause a new connection to be 
		  created; the reservation is indicated by pointing the 
		  crossConnectionObjectPointer of the bridgeRollToTp to the existing 
		  crossConnection or mpCrossConnection object instance. If the operation is 
		  successful, the bridgeRollComplete field is NULL.
		For a roll operation, the manager must specify the same cross-connection and 
		termination points that were specified in the bridge operation. The 
		bridgeRollFromTp identifies the termination point from which service will be 
		rolled. The results of a roll operation depend on the type of connection:
		- If the connection is bidirectional, the crossConnection associated with the 
		  bridgeRollFromTp is made unidirectional, and the crossConnection associated 
		  with the bridgeRollToTp is made bidirectional. If the operation is successful, 
		  the bridgeRollComplete field is NULL.
		- If the connection is unidirectional (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint), 
		  and the bridgeRollFromTp is the toTermination of the connection, there is no 
		  change to the configuration. - - If the operation is successful, the 
		  bridgeRollComplete field is NULL.
		- If the connection is unidirectional (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint), 
		  and the bridgeRollFromTp is the fromTermination of the connection, the 
		  fromTermination of the connection is changed from the bridgeRollFromTp to the 
		  bridgeRollToTp. If the operation is successful, the bridgeRollComplete field 
		  is NULL.
		For a releaseBridge operation, the manager must specify the same 
		cross-connection and termination points that were specified in the bridge 
		operation. The bridgeRollFromTp identifies the termination point that is to be 
		removed from the cross-connection. The results of a releaseBridge operation 
		depend on the type of connection:
		- If the connection is bidirectional, or the connection is unidirectional 
		  (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint) and the bridgeRollFromTp is not the 
		  toTermination of the connection, the releaseBridge operation causes the 
		  crossConnection that is associated with the bridgeRollFromTp to be deleted. If 
		  the operation was successful, the bridgeRollComplete field indicates the 
		  crossConnection that was deleted.
		- If the connection is unidirectional (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint) 
		  and the bridgeRollFromTp is reserved by the connection, but is not the 
		  fromTermination of the connection, the releaseBridge operation causes the 
		  bridgeRollFromTp to be unreserved; this is indicated by pointing the 
		  crossConnectionObjectPointer of that termination point to the fabric. If the 
		  operation was successful, the bridgeRollComplete field is NULL.";

			DEFINED AS
				"This action is used to establish a connection between termination points or

				ways:
				1) by explicitly identifying the two termination points or GTPs;
				2) by specifying one termination point or GTP, and specifying a tpPool from 
				   which any idle termination point/GTP may be used. The result, if successful, 
				   always returns an explicit list of termination points or GTP.
				There are two basic forms of cross-connection arrangement: point-to-point and 
				point to multi-point (broadcast). A single cross-connection is created if either 
				the explicitPtoP or ptoTpPool option is selected in this action. This 
				cross-connection object points to the termination points or GTPs involved in the 
				cross-connection. Connections are indicated in termination points by the 
				connectivityPointer attribute. If the administrativeState in the crossConnection 
				object is unlocked, this attribute is set, as a result of this action, to the 
				local name of the termination point to which it is connected. Also, the 
				crossConnectionObjectPointer in the termination points or GTPs points to the 
				cross-connection object.
				For point to multi-point cross-connection (indicated by choosing the 
				explicitPtoMp or ptoMPools option), one multi-point cross-connection object will 
				be created containing one crossConnection object for each termination point 
				specified in the toTps parameter. In the source TP the 
				crossConnectionObjectPointer will point at the newly created Multi-point 
				cross-connect object. In each Tp named in the toTPs list (possibly selected from 
				a specified tpPool), the CrossConnectionObject pointer will point at the 
				corresponding cross-connection object. The connectivity pointers in the 
				connected termination points will be updated to reflect the new connectivity.
				The idleTPcount and the connectedTPcount attributes in the tpPool object (if 
				any) are updated as a result of the action. If a GTP is implicitly defined by 
				specifying several termination points to be connected together, the GTP object 
				will be automatically created and its id will be returned in the action reply.
				If an Indirect Adaptor is specified, a GTP representing the CTPs contained from 
				the Indirect Adaptor will be created and it will be connected.
				The administrative state of the created cross-connection or multi-point 
				cross-connection objects is specified as an optional parameter of this action. 
				If this parameter is omitted, the administrative state will be set to 'unlocked' 
				(unless the addLegs parameter is specified). This action will fail if any of the 
				termination points specified is already involved in a cross-connection or if 
				part of an existing GTP is specified.
				If the addLeg parameter is specified, one or more Legs will be added to an 
				existing multi-point cross-connection arrangement. Selected termination points 
				or GTPs must support a similar signal type to that of the termination points 
				already connected to the arrangement. The result, if successful, always returns 
				the termination points or GTPs involved in the multi-point cross-connection. A 
				cross-connection object is created as a result of this action. This object will 
				be named from the specified mpCrossConnection object instance. The 
				administrative state of the created cross-connection object will be the same as 
				that of the containing multi-point cross-connection object unless otherwise 
				specified in the action parameters.
