MODULE "ITU-T Rec. X.283 (1997) | ISO/IEC 10733 : 1998" { joint-iso-ccitt network-layer(13) }
--5.2 Common behaviour templates

commonCreationDeletion-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!Managed object class imports the ISO/IEC 10165-2 objectCreation and 
		objectDeletion notifications. Used as follows:

		objectCreation - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		created. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification.

		If creation occurred as a result of internal operation of the resource, the 
		value 'resourceOperation' is used. If creation occurred in response to a 
		management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A value of 
		'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source of the 
		operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.

		objectDeletion - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		deleted. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification.

		If deletion occurred as a result of internal operation of the resource, the 
		value 'resourceOperation' is used. If deletion occurred in response to a 
		management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A value of 
		'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source of the 
		operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.!;


commonStateChange-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!Managed object class imports the ISO/IEC 10165-2 stateChange notification. Used 
		to report the changes to the operationalState attribute, and where present, the 
		administrativeState attribute. A single parameter set is included in the State 
		change definition field. Only the (mandatory) attributeId and (optional) 
		newAttributeValue parameters are used.!;


octetsSentReceivedCounter-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!The octetsSentCounter and octetsReceivedCounter shall count only user data 
		octets in valid data packets. They shall not count user data octets in data 
		packets which are rejected for any reason, nor user data octets in non data 
		packets.!;


successfulConnectionEstablishment-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!This Package imports the communicationsInformation notification from "GMI". It 
		is used to report the following events. successfulConnectionEstablishment: 
		Generated when a connection is successfully established. However, the precise 
		synchronization between the notification and the corresponding protocol and 
		service interface interactions is not defined by this Specification. The value 
		NLM.successfulConnectionEstablishment shall be reported in the informationType 
		field.!;


deactivateConnection-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!The Deactivate action causes the connection to be terminated. The termination 
		should occur as rapidly as practical, but no particular time constraints are 
		implied. Typically, this action simulates a disconnect request received across 
		the service interface. If a more rapid means for terminating the connection 
		exists, then this should be used. The termination shall occur in conformance to 
		the protocol standard. The Managed Object remains in existence after completion 
		of the Deactivate action. It is subsequently deleted when the connection is 
		terminated, in the same way as if the connection has been terminated by other 
		means. A deactivate action may fail (with the ProcessingError response) if it is 
		temporarily not possible to terminate the connection.!;


resettingTimer-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!This attribute specifies the interval between certain events in the operation of 
		the protocol state machine. If the value of this attribute is changed to a new 
		value while the protocol state machine is in operation, the implementation shall 
		take the necessary steps to ensure that for any time interval which was in 
		progress when the corresponding attribute was changed, the next expiration of 
		that interval takes place no later than the expiration of the interval in 
		progress or the specified interval whichever is the sooner. The precision with 
		which this time shall be implemented shall be the same as that associated with 
		the basic operation of the timer attribute.!;

-- Linkage Managed Object
--
-- There is one of these MOs associated with each separate provision of the underlying service to 
-- the superior protocol machine.  Its definition permits it to be created and deleted explicitly by 
-- management operation, but in some systems it will exist inherently and neither creation nor 
-- deletion by management operation will be possible. Name bindings are defined for both cases.
--
-- When the linkage is operable, the operationalState shall have the value 'enabled'; otherwise it 
-- shall have the value 'disabled'.  Transitions of operationalState shall be reported using the 
-- stateChange notification. A linkage MO may be created in the 'enabled' operational state.

		X.721 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10165-2. It is used to report the following x25PLE 
		managed object events.

		providerInitiatedDisconnect: Issued upon receipt of a clear packet with a cause 
		code other than 'DTE originated'.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER.

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value 'False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it. The value 
		NLM.providerInitiatedDisconnect shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to 'Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of 'Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the additionalInformation field.

		remotelyInitiatedReset: Issued upon occurrence of a remotely initiated reset. 
		This event is issued in lieu of a 'providerInitiatedReset' when operating in a 
		DTE-DXE environment. The information relating to the packet shall be reported as 
		a parameter in the additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using 
		the notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value 'False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it. The value 
		NLM.remotelyInitiatedDisconnect shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to 'Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of 'Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the additionalInformation field.

		providerInitiatedReset: Issued upon occurrence of a provider initiated reset. 
		This event is issued when operating in a DTE-DCE environment. The information 
		relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value 'False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it. The value 
		NLM.providerInitiatedReset shall be reported in the specificProblems parameter. 
		The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to 'Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of 'Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the additionalInformation field.

		remotelyInitiatedRestart: Issued upon receipt of a remotely (including provider) 
		initiated restart.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value 'False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it. The value 
		NLM.remotelyInitiatedRestart shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to 'Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of 'Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the additionalInformation field.

		restartCountExceeded: Issued on restart failure due to restart count (R20) 
		exceeded. The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a 
		parameter in the additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using 
		the notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value 'False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it.

		The value NLM.restartCountExceeded shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to 'Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of 'Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the additionalInformation field.

		protocolErrorDetectedLocally: Issued upon receipt of a packet which causes the 
		"A=Error" action in the ISO/IEC 8208 or ITU-T Rec. X.25 state tables to be 
		taken.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER.

		The values of cause and diagnostic codes shall be those which would have been 
		placed in a diagnostic packet had one been generated by the DTE (i.e. as if it 
		were a DTE). The actual generation of such a packet is not required.

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value 'False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it. The value 
		NLM.communicationsProtocolErrorDetectedLocally shall be reported in the 
		specificProblems parameter.

		The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to 'Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of 'Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the additionalInformation field.

		accusedOfProtocolError: Issued upon receipt of a diagnostic packet or a clear, 
		reset or restart packet with a cause code equal to one of the following: Remote 
		Procedure Error, Incompatible Destination, Invalid Facility Request, Local 
		Procedure Error. No other x25PLE communication alarm shall be generated as a 
		result of this particular instance of packet.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the
