MODULE "ITU-T Rec. G.774 : 2001"
--6 Object classes 
--This  clause  provides  replacement  managed  object  class  definitions  for  the  existing 
--Recommendation G.774 (1992). Any  managed object class replaced  by the one  in this clause  is 
--considered to be deprecated. The reasons  for the replacement of a  managed object class are as 
--follows: 
--a)  The replaced managed object class is faulty and must be fixed. 
--b)  The replaced managed object class includes an attribute, package, notification or action that 
--has been re-registered in this Recommendation. 
--c)  The replaced  managed object class  inherits  from a  managed object class that has  been 
--re-registered in this Recommendation. 
--In each case where a class is replaced, the new class will be registered within this Recommendation. 
--The textual label for the class will be revised to include the text "R1". For example, in the revision of 
--the G.774 (1992) "au4CTPSink"  managed  object class, the revised  label  will  become 
--"au4CTPSinkR1". 
--Below  is a table of classes deprecated  from Recommendation  G.774 (1992) and the  new G.774 
--classes that replace them:

--This  clause provides replacement package definitions  for the existing Recommendation G.774 
--(1992). Any package replaced by one in this clause is considered to be deprecated. The reasons for 
--the replacement of a package are as follows: 
--1)  The replaced package is faulty and must be fixed. 
--2)  The replaced package  includes an  attribute, package, notification or action which has been 
--re-registered in this Recommendation. 
--In each case where  a package  is replaced, the new package will  be registered within this 
--Recommendation. The textual  label  for the package will  be revised to include the text "R1". For 
--example, in the revision of the G.774 (1992) package "vc3-4SourcePackage", the revised label will 
--become "vc3-4SourcePackageR1". 
--Below  is a table of packages deprecated from Recommendation G.774 (1992) and the G.774

--9  Name Bindings 
--This clause provides replacement namebinding definitions  for the existing Recommendation G.774 
--(1992). Any namebinding replaced by one in this clause is considered to be deprecated. The reasons 
--for the replacement of a namebinding are as follows: 
--1)  The replaced namebinding is faulty and must be fixed. 
--2)  The replaced namebinding refers to a superior  managed object class which  has been 
--re-registered in this Recommendation. 
--3)  The replaced  namebinding refers to a subordinate managed object class which  has  been 
--re-registered in this Recommendation. 
--4)  The replaced namebinding refers to a naming attribute which has been re-registered in this 
--Recommendation. 
--In each case where a namebinding is replaced, the new namebinding will  be registered within this 
--Recommendation. The textual label for the namebinding will be revised to include the text "R1". For 
--example,  in the revision of the G.774 (1992) namebinding  "vcnUserChannelCTPSource-
--vc4TTPSource",  the revised  label will  become "vcnUserChannelCTPSource-vc4TTPSourceR1" or 
--in the case of the "vc4TTPSink-sdhNE" namebinding, the revised  label  becomes 
--"vc4TTPSinkR1-sdhNE". Note  the "R1"  is placed  immediately  following the revised  class which 
--impacts the namebinding. 
--Below  is a table of  namebindings deprecated from Recommendation G.774 (1992) and  the G.774 
--namebindings which replace them:

--11.1.1  Subordination rule templates 
--SUPERIOR OBJECT CLASS <class-label>;
--indicates the class that is governing this subordination-rule. A class may govern through more than 
--one subordination-rule several non-overlapping sets of subordinate classes in the NAMES 
--SUBORDINATES clause. 
--NAMES SUBORDINATES <class-list>;
--indicates the set of classes of subordinates that are governed by this subordination-rule. Any classes 
--that are not in this list are not governed by this subordination-rule. 
--ACCORDING TO RULE <subordination-rule>
--provides the rule 
--SET { <subordination-members> }

--governed by more than one constraint-rule with non-overlapping sets of related classes in the 
--RELATES TO OBJECT CLASSES clause. 
--IS RELATED TO OBJECT CLASSES <class-list>;
--indicates the set of classes of related instances that are governed by this constraint-rule. Any classes 
--that are not in this list are not governed by this constraint-rule. 
--USING ATTRIBUTE <attribute-label>;
--indicates the attribute that represents a relationship by means of a pointer (DN) to the related object 
--instances.  
-- <constraint-rule-set>;
--there can be either a single rule, or a set of rules one for each of a set of named choices. In the latter 
--case the CASE { ... } structure is used. 
--CASE { ... };
--provides a distinct constraint-rule for each of the set of named choices in the attribute syntax. 
--ACCORDING TO RULE <constraint-rule>
--provides the rule 
--SET { <constraint-members> }
--indicates that *all* of the constraint-members must be present in any order. 
--SEQUENCE { <constraint-members> }
--indicates that *all* of the constraint-members must be present in sequence.

--SEQUENCE SIZE <ordinality> OF <constraint-term>

--11.2  Connectivity pointer constraints 
--This clause defines the allowable  values for  the downstreamConnectivityPointer and 
--upstreamConnectivityPointer attributes using the object classes defined in this Recommendation. 
--This clause provides replacement constraint rule definitions for the existing Recommendation G.774 
--(1992). Any  constraint rule replaced  by one  in this clause  is considered to be deprecated. The 
--reasons for the replacement of a constraint rule are as follows: 
--1)  The replaced constraint rule is faulty and must be fixed. 
--2)  The replaced constraint rule refers to a managed object class which has been re-registered in 
--this Recommendation. 
--3)  The replaced constraint rule refers to an attribute which  has  been re-registered  in this 
--Recommendation. 
--In each case where a constraint is replaced, the new constraint will  be registered within this 
--Recommendation. The textual  label  for the constraint will  be revised to include the text "R1". For 
--example,  in the revision of the G.774 (1992) constraint "downstreamConnectivityPointer-
--au3CTPSink", the revised  label will  become "downstreamConnectivityPointer-au3CTPSinkR1". 
--Note the "R1" is placed immediately following the revised class which impacts the constraint. In the 
--case where the class within the  label has not changed but the constraint  is  still  altered because the 
--constraint refers to a class that  has changed, then the "R1"  is placed  immediately  following the 
--"downstreamConnectivityPointer" text of the revised constraint label. For example, in the revision of 
--the G.774 (1992) constraint "downstreamConnectivityPointer-au3CTPSource", the revised label will 
--become "downstreamConnectivityPointerR1-au3CTPSource". 
--Below is a table of constraint rules deprecated from Recommendation G.774 (1992) and the G.774 
--constraint rules which replace them:

--11.3  Naming constraints 
--This clause defines the allowable combinations  of subordinate object class  instances that may  be 
--named  by a superior object class  instance, using the object classes contained  in this 
--Recommendation. 
--This  clause  provides  replacement  subordination  rule  definitions  for  the  existing 
--Recommendation G.774 (1992). Any subordination rule replaced by one in this clause is considered 
--to be deprecated. The reasons for the replacement of a subordination rule are as follows: 
--1)  The replaced subordination rule is faulty and must be fixed. 
--2)  The replaced subordination rule refers to a  managed object class which  has  been 
--re-registered in this Recommendation. 
--In each case where a subordination rule  is replaced, the  new subordination rule will  be registered 
--within this Recommendation. The textual label for the subordination rule will be revised to include 
--the text "R1". For example,  in the revision of the G.774 (1992) subordination rule 
--"vc3TTPSinkSubordination", the revised  label will  become "vc3TTPSinkR1Subordination". Note 
--the "R1"  is placed  immediately  following the revised class which  impacts the  subordination rule. 
--In the case where the  class within the  label  has not changed  but the subordination rule  is  still 
--altered because the subordination rule refers to a class that has changed, then the "R1"  is placed at 
--the end of the revised subordination rule  label.  For example,  in the revision of the G.774 (1992) 
--subordination rule "tug3BidirectionalSubordination", the revised  label will  become 
--"tug3BidirectionalSubordinationR1". 
--Below  is a table of subordination rules deprecated  from  Recommendation G.774 (1992) and the 
--G.774 subordination rules which replace them.
