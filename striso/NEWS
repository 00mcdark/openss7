The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 ISO Stack package.

 Initial release striso-0.9.2.3
-------------------------------

This is the second open source release of the `OpenSS7 ISO Stack'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the ISO/OSI
components were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the ISO/OSI components previously part of the
`strss7' package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the release, or `Schedule', in
the manual, for information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is LAPB.  `lapb(4)'
is a pushable "STREAMS" module that is pushed over a `cdi(4)' HDLC
channel to form an X.25 data link providing the Data Link Provider
Interface, `dlpi(7)'.  A complete test suite will be available in a
further release.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full ISO/OSI
X.25< CONS, CLNS, and TP0 through TP4, drivers with conformance test
suites.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).

   - Supports build on Ubuntu 7.04.

   - Updated to gettext 0.16.1.

   - Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 and
     2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 kernel.

   - Supports build on Fedora Core 6.

   - Support for recent distribuations and tool chains.


 Initial release striso-0.9.2.2
-------------------------------

This is the second open source release of the `OpenSS7 ISO Stack'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

X.25< CONS, CLNS, and TP0 through TP4, drivers with conformance test
suites.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Improvements to the common build environment with better support
     for standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

   - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.

   - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number
     as unpacked by separate tarball.


 Initial release striso-0.9.2.1
-------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `striso' release.

This is the initial open source release of the `OpenSS7 ISO Stack'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the ISO/OSI
components were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the ISO/OSI components previously part of the
`strss7' package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the release, or `Schedule', in
the manual, for information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is LAPB.  `lapb(4)'
is a pushable "STREAMS" module that is pushed over a `cdi(4)' HDLC
channel to form an X.25 data link providing the Data Link Provider
Interface, `dlpi(7)'.  A complete test suite will be available in a
further release.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full ISO/OSI
X.25< CONS, CLNS, and TP0 through TP4, drivers with conformance test
suites.

 Initial release striso-0.9.2.1.rc3
-----------------------------------

Third release candidate.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Updated `init' scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.
     `striso' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: `LiS' cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.

 Initial release striso-0.9.2.1.rc2
-----------------------------------

Second release candidate.

   - Added `--enable-devel' `configure' option for embedded targets.

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.

 Initial release striso-0.9.2.1rc1
----------------------------------

First release candidate.

   - Initial package skeleton including `Installation and Reference
     Manual' and all necessary files and directories.

This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.
