The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 ISO Stack package.

 Initial release striso-0.9.2.1
-------------------------------

This is the initial alpha release for `Linux Fast-STREAMS' and is part
of the OpenSS7 Master Package (as of `openss7-0.9.2.D').

This release is the initial public release.

_This is the initial public alpha release of the package.  Please see
`README-alpha' in the release or `Maturity', in the manual._

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, contact <info@openss7.com>.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM-based or dpkg-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the *Note GNU General Public
License:: Version 2.  The release is available as an `autoconf'
tarball, SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs or DEBs.  See the download
page (http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf'
tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs.  See the striso package page
(http://www.openss7.org/striso_pkg.html) for tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and
binary RPMs or DEBs.

See `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/striso-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog' and
`http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/striso-0.9.2.1/NEWS' in the release
for more information.  Also, see the `striso.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html `http://www.openss7.org/striso_manual.html').

 Initial release striso-0.9.2.1.rc3
-----------------------------------

Third release candidate.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Updated `init' scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.
     `striso' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: `LiS' cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.

 Initial release striso-0.9.2.1.rc2
-----------------------------------

Second release candidate.

   - Added `--enable-devel' `configure' option for embedded targets.

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.

 Initial release striso-0.9.2.1rc1
----------------------------------

First release candidate.

   - Initial package skeleton including `Installation and Reference
     Manual' and all necessary files and directories.

This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.
