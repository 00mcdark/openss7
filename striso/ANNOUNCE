Package striso-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

OpenSS7 ISO Stack (striso) is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of
various Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) International Standards
Organization (ISO) networking components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.

This release is the first separate release of the OpenSS7 ISO Stack
package.  Some of the components in this package were formerly present
in the `strss7' package.  Various networking drivers are provided as
well as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and XTI header files for ISO/OSI operation.
The package contains the necessary manual pages and other documentation
for ISO/OSI components in a separate autoconf tarball.

The package uses the following standard Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)
conforming header files from the `strxns' package:

     - <sys/cdi.h> Communications Device Interface
     - <sys/dlpi.h> Data Link Provider Interface Version 2.0.0
     - <sys/npi.h> Network Provider Interface Version 2.0.0

The package uses the following standard Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)
conforming header files from the `strxnet' package:

     - <sys/tihdr.h> Transport Provider Interface Version 2.0.0

The package currently includes the following STREAMS kernel modules and
drivers:

     - streams_x223.ko    /dev/cons
     - streams_x233.ko    /dev/clns
     - streams_x224.ko    /dev/tp0 /dev/tp4
     - streams_X234.ko    /dev/clts
     - streams_isot.ko    module /dev/isot
     - streams_lpp.ko     module /dev/lpp
     - streams_cmot.ko    module /dev/cmot
     - streams_itot.ko    module
     - streams_itos.ko    module

   * x223(4) driver provides CONS and CLNS services in accordance
     with the ISO/OSI Network Protocol X.223;

   * x224(4) driver provides OSI Transport Protocol services in
     accordance with the ISO/OSI Transport Protocol X.224;

   * isot(4) driver and module provides ISO Transport over TCP/IP
     as specified in RFC 1006/STD 35;

   * lpp(4) driver and module provides ISO Transport over TCP/IP as
     specified in RFC 1085;

   * cmot(4) driver and modules provides ISO Common Management
     Information Protocol (CMIP) over TCP/IP as specified in RFC 1095;

   * itot(4) module provides ISO Transport over TCP as specified in
     RFC 2126; and,

   * itos(4) module provides ISO Transport over SCTP.

The OpenSS7 ISO Stack package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and
development environment for the development and execution of X/Open
Network Services (ISO) protocol stack components and applications for
the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This is the initial open source release of the OpenSS7 ISO Stack
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which are
only recently available as open source with the release of this package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release openss7-0.9.2.D, the ISO/OSI
components were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the ISO/OSI components previously part of the
`strss7' package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See TODO in the release, or `Schedule', in the
manual, for information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is LAPB.
lapb(4) is a pushable STREAMS module that is pushed over a cdi(4) HDLC
channel to form an X.25 data link providing the Data Link Provider
Interface, dlpi(7).  A complete test suite will be available in a
further release.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full ISO/OSI
X.25< CONS, CLNS, and TP0 through TP4, drivers with conformance test
suites.

_This is the initial public alpha release of the package.  Please see
README-alpha in the release or `Maturity', in the manual._

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, contact <info@openss7.com>.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
striso package page (http://www.openss7.org/striso_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/striso-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/striso-0.9.2.1/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `striso.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/striso_manual.html).

This release is a separate release of the OpenSS7 ISO Stack package.
Some of the components in this package were formerly present in the
strss7 package.  Various networking drivers are provided as well as CDI,

release, and is an optional part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (as of
openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is the second open source release of the OpenSS7 ISO Stack
package.  Some of the components in this package were formerly present
in the strss7 package.  Various networking drivers are provided as well
as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and XTI header files for ISO/OSI operation.  The
package contains the necessary manual pages and other documentation for
ISO/OSI components in a separate autoconf tarball.

This is the initial alpha release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is part of
the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.E).

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

 - Improvements to the common build environment with better support for
   standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

 - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

 - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.

 - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as
   unpacked by separate tarball.

This is a public alpha release of the package.  This package is
currently incomplete.  It is being released as a reference point for the
community.  If you are interested in completion of this package, contact
info@openss7.com.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.
