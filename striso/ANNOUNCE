striso-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 on August 23, 2006.

STREAMS ISO is an implementation of the International Organization for
Standardization Open Systems Interconnect protocols for Linux
Fast-STREAMS and provides OSI conforming modules and drivers for Data
Link, Network Services, Transport Services, ACSE, ROSE and CMISE.  In
addition, it contains modules and drivers for providing ISOT, ITOT, XOT,
LPP and CMOT.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's first release from the OpenSS7 Project of
the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISO modules.  This package was never part of the
deprecated Linux STREAMS LiS-2.18.0 package.  These networking modules
provide all manner of ISO OSI and X.25 drivers and modules.  The package
contains all the necessary manual pages and other documentation for ISO
components in an autoconf tarball.

 This is the initial public alpha release of the package.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.
Commercial licensing of the package can be obtained by contacting
sales@openss7.com.

The release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of
binary RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html>
for the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the striso package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/striso_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/striso-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/striso-0.9.2.1/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the striso.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/striso_manual.html>).
