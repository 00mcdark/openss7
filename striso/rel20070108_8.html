This release is the first separate release of the `OpenSS7 ISO Stack' package.  Some of the
components in this package were formerly present in the `strss7' package.  Various networking
drivers are provided as well as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and XTI header files for ISO/OSI operation.  The
package contains the necessary manual pages and other documentation for ISO/OSI components in a
separate autoconf tarball.

This is the initial alpha release for `Linux Fast-STREAMS' and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package

<li>Additional features supported in all packages (see master package release notes).</li>
<!--
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new - -with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added - -disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>

<& SELF:abstract &>
OpenSS7 ISO Stack (striso) is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of various Open Systems Interconnect
(OSI) International Standards Organization (ISO) networking components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is a separate release of the OpenSS7 ISO Stack package.  Some of the components in this
package were formerly present in the `strss7' package.  Various networking drivers are provided as
well as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and XTI header files for ISO/OSI operation.  The package contains the
necessary manual pages and other documentation for ISO/OSI componentsin a separate autoconf tarball.
This release is a pre-alpha release, and is an optional part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(as of openss7-0.9.2.D).

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
