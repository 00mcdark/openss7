Package osr61-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 2007-03-15.

The Dialogic Open Systems Release 6.1 package provides STREAMS modules
and drivers, libraries, programs, init scripts, and daemons that
implement the Dialogic(R) Open System Release 6.1 drivers for Linux
Fast-STREAMS.

This is an OpenSS7 Project modified relase of the GPL Dialogic(R) OSR
6.1 Release 239 drivers modified for use with Linux Fast-STREAMS.

The Dialogic Open Systems Release 6.1 package includes kernel modules,
SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs,
daemons, and development environment for the development and execution
of Dialogic Open Systems Release 6.1 components and applications for the
SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.  It provides true STREAMS-based Dialogic(R)
OSR 6.1 drivers for Linux.

The package builds and installs the following STREAMS kernel modules and
drivers:

     - streams_dlgnDriver.ko driver /dev/streams/dlgn
     - streams_gncfdDriver.ko driver /dev/streams/gncfd
     - streams_gpioDriver.ko driver /dev/streams/gpio
     - streams_mercdDriver.ko driver /dev/streams/mercd
     - streams_dvbmDriver.ko module dvbm
     - streams_sctmrDriver.ko module sctmr
     - pmacd.ko driver
     - ctimod.ko module

The Springware device drivers support the ability to run the older
Springware legacy platform.  These are STREAMS based and use STREAMS
functionality provided by Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Unlike DM3 or PMAC, a
common library interface to access these drivers does no exist which
makes their removal difficult.  All User Interfaces are provided by
Linux Fast-STREAMS, based on the STREAMS protocol.

dlgn(4)
     The dlgn(4) driver is a device driver that provides access to the
     Dialogic(R) SpringWare and Antares boards.

gncfd(4)
     The gncfd(4) driver is a generic configuration driver that is used
     by the Dialogic(R) runtime libraries to perform configuration for
     Dialogic(R) SpringWare and Antares boards.

gpio(4)
     The gpio(4) driver is the generic input-output interface for
     downloading firmware.

mercd(4)
     The mercd(4) driver is a device driver for the Dialogic(R) DM3
     family of boards including the Mercury board (after which it is
     named).

dvbm(4)
     The dvbm(4) module is a device access module that is pushed over a
     dlgn(4) driver Stream.

sctmr(4)
     The sctmr(4) module is a timer module that is pushed over a dlgn(4)
     driver Stream (but may also be pushed over a null Stream such as
     nuls(4)).

pmacd(4)
     The pmacd(4) driver is a non-STREAMS driver for the Dialogic(R) IPT
     family of boards.

ctimod(4)
     The ctimod(4) kernel module is a CTI wrapper module that provides
     wrappers of kernel functions for use principally by the pmacd(4)
     driver.

The Dialogic Open Systems Release 6.1 package includes kernel modules,
SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs,
daemons, and development environment for the development and execution
of Dialogic Open Systems Release 6.1 components and applications for the
SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This distribution is only currently applicable to Linux 2.4 and 2.6
kernels and was targeted at ix86, x86_64, ppc and ppc64 architectures,
but should build and install for other architectures as well.

This release is the initial public release.

Major features are as follows:

 - In this initial release, the package already supports a wide range of
   production distributions as it uses the same build environment as
   other OpenSS7 Project packages.

 - Added versions to all exported symbols.  Made LFS unique functions
   GPL export.

 - Improvements to the common build environment with better support for
   standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

 - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with
   inode diet patchset).

This is the initial public alpha release of the package.  Please see
README-alpha in the release, or Maturity, in the manual.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
osr61 package page (http://www.openss7.org/osr61_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/osr61-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/osr61-0.9.2.1/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `osr61.pdf' manual in the release (also
in html http://www.openss7.org/osr61_manual.html).
