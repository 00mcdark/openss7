@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This is the first release from @cite{The OpenSS7 Project} of the
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package.  This package provides @file{dlgn},
@file{mercd} and @file{pmacd} device drivers, as well as a @file{dvbm} and
@file{sctmr} module.  Additional drivers are the @file{gncfd} and @file{gpio}
modules.  The package contains all the necessary manual pages and other
documentation for components in an autoconf tarball.

This release is the initial public release.

@itemize -
@item
In this initial release, the package already supports a wide range of production
distributions as it uses the same build environment as other OpenSS7 Project
packages.

@item
Added versions to all exported symbols.  Made LFS unique functions GPL export.

@item
Improvements to the common build environment with better support for standalone
package builds on 2.4 kernels.

@item
Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet
patchset).

@end itemize

@emph{This is the initial public alpha release of the package.  Please see
@file{README-alpha} in the release, or @refman{Maturity}.}

This is the initial public alpha release of the package.  This package is
complete but untested.  It is being released for testing by the community.  If
you are interested in testing of this package, contact
@email{info@@openss7.com}.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and
builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the @cite{GNU General Public License
Version 2}.  The release is available as an @command{autoconf} tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html,downloads page} for the
@command{autoconf} tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and
binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/@value{PACKAGE}_pkg.html,@value{PACKAGE} package
page}.
