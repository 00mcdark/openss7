@subsubheading Current Plan

The development on this package is stalled pending some hardware to test or user or vendor input
with regard to testing against actual hardware.  The package will have maintenance releases about
every 3 to 6 months to support Linux distribution and kernel changes; however, the overall status
of the package will not change and no futher development will be done until somebody starts using
the package.  If you are interested in this package, subscribe to and send mail to openss7-develop
mailing list.  If you have some test results to report, subscribe to and send mail to openss7-test
mailing list.

@subsubheading Things to Do

@itemize @minus
@item
Testing.  This package is completely untested.

@emph{*todo*}

@item
Rewrite the PMAC driver as a STREAMS driver.

@emph{*todo*}
@end itemize

The @command{@value{PACKAGE}} package is currently complete but untested.

The purpose of the package was to provide @dfn{STREAMS} Dialogic@registeredsymbol{} drivers for
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.  These drivers and modules will not work with @cite{LiS}.  The package
will only build and install with @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}

If someone is interested in this package, a contribution of suitable hardware for testing would be
good.  Also, external testing could be performed.
