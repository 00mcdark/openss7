This release is primarily a maintenance release.  No significant defect corrections or development
has been applied, however, significant testing has been performed.  This release is a stable
production release for `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.  Support for `LiS' is deprecated as of this release.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>This release was tested at the 10th SCTP Interop in Vancouver, Canada, at the beginning of
August, 2006.  This implementation showed well and interoperated successfully with all
implementations present.  Interoperability testing was performed using Linux Fast-STREAMS on the
latest, at the time, Fedora Core 5 kernel (2.6.18) and Ubuntu 6.06 Server (2.6.15).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules and
drivers.  The `make installcheck' target will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for `LiS'.</li>
<li>Updated `init' scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.  `strsctp' now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: `LiS' cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional `SuSE' distributions on `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
`SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent `gcc' compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.</li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.6 of the STREAMS SCTP <em>strsctp</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
`OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP' (`strsctp') is an `OpenSS7 Project' implementation of Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP - RFC 2960) for `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.  It is based on the same protocol
engine core as the OpenSS7 Linux Native (Sockets) version of OpenSS7 SCTP.  The package provides a
STREAMS SCTP driver for use with SIGTRAN components of the OpenSS7 stack.

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds rpms for a
wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
