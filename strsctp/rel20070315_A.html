This release is the sixth separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP driver that was formerly
present in the OpenSS7 SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP <a href="strss7_pkg.html">strss7</a> package.  The
networking driver (<code>streams-sctp</code>) is provided, as well as NPI, TPI and XTI header files
for SCTP operation.  The package contains the necessary manual pages and other documentation for
SCTP components in a separate autoconf tarball.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is a stable production release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.
This release is primarily a maintenance release to support recent
distributions and tool chains.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Major features since the last public release are as follows:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Fixed a buffer double-free bug when out-of-the-blue messages were
being processed on non-listening Streams.  See
<a href="codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.7/BUGS">BUGS</a>
in the release for more information.<bdo/></li>
<li>Fixed a rather noxious locking bug in sctp_cleanup_read() that was
suppressing interrupts across a putnext() call.  See
<a href="codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.7/BUGS">BUGS</a>
in the release for more information.<bdo/></li>
<li>Improvements to the common build environment with better support
for standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.<bdo/></li>
<li>The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number
as unpacked by separate tarball.<bdo/></li>
</ul><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<em>This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it deprecates previous
    releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before reporting bugs.</em>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.7 of the STREAMS SCTP <em>strsctp</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP (`strsctp') is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP - RFC 2960) for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  It is based on the same protocol
engine core as the OpenSS7 Linux Native (Sockets) version of OpenSS7 SCTP.  The package provides a
STREAMS SCTP driver for use with SIGTRAN components of the OpenSS7 stack.

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
