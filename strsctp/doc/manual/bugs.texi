Another bug found, a double buffer free in sctp_recv_msg() when calling
sctp_rcv_ootb().  This bug was discovered during verification testing on a high
speed SMP machine.

@emph{*fixed*} in @command{strsctp-0.9.2.7}

@item 003.  2007-03-10T05:59:10-0700

One serious locking problem discovered.  sctp_cleanup_read() was suppressing
IRQs across calls to putnext() when delivering data and acknowledgements.
Recent kernels on Fedora and Ubuntu were complaining about IRQs suppressed
across calls to local_bh_enable() in M2PA and that is what lead to the
discovery.

@emph{*fixed*} in @command{strsctp-0.9.2.7}

When the number of test packets is set to 300, we are crashing on high speed SMP
HT box.  This seems to be a locking problem of sorts, or some flow control race
condition.  For now, the number of test packets, TEST_PACKETS has been reduced
from 300 to 30 to avoid the crash.  Again, packet tests at IP level should
reveal this problem.

Note that there does not seem to be a problem with similar TPI tests, so the
problem might be NPI interface related after all.

@item test-sctp_n -o 7.1 Sun, 15 Oct 2006 06:22:05 -0600

I notice that when the message size in this test is larger than the receive
window size on the receiver, the receiver aborts the association after its
window fills.  If the message size is reduced to just beneath the receive window
size, the test case succeeds.  So, it looks like we are not handling zero window
probes very well at all.  For now I have just reduced the message size as this
is for interface testing not packet testing.  Packet tests at IP level should
reveal this problem.
