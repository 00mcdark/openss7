I notice that when the message size in this test is larger than the receive window size on the
receiver, the receiver aborts the association after its window fills.  If the message size is
reduced to just beneath the receive window size, the test case succeeds.  So, it looks like we are
not handling zero window probes very well at all.  For now I have just reduced the message size as
this is for interface testing not packet testing.  Packet tests at IP level should reveal this
problem.
