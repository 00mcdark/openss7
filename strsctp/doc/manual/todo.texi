Things to do:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The strsctp package is quite stable and mature as of strsctp-0.9.2.2 and most of the things that
remain to be done are rigorous conformance and performance testing.
@end itemize

@itemize @minus
@item
Move the tpiperf(4) module to the strxnet package and rename it tiperf(4).

@item
Implement pseudo-connectionless modes in sctp(4) driver.  Document use of pseudo-connectionless
modes for SCTP.  Pseudo-connectionless modes permit a connection-oriented (T_COTS) provider such as
SCTP to provide the appearance of connectionless service.  This makes support for the SCTP
one-to-many model easier.  Also, it provides a way (t_sndudata(3), t_sndvudata(3), t_rcvudata(3),
t_rcvvudata(3)) of passing options associated with the packet to the provider either in a T_OPTDATA
ro in a T_UNITDATA.  This would make support of SCTP's many per-packet options more workable for XTI
as well as providing an easier translation between the sockets API and XTI API for sctp.

Note that this is also very applicable to SCTP protocol classes 2 and 3 and BSSAP.

@item
SCTP Interoperability testing.  Take the STREAMS package to the SCTP Interop tests at UBC and
perform interoperability testing.

@emph{*Complete*}
  
Tested perfect against all functional implementations present.  Passed 720 Mbps compiled with no
optimizations and debugging assertions turned on.  Still have to go through the logs and collect
warnings and investigate them.  Still have to complete optimized performance testing.

@item
Work recent SCTP I-G changes into the code.

@item
Testing and Validation using existing test suites.

@item
Writing new IP-packet-level conformance test suites.

@item
It would also be an idea to make the STREAMS SCTP Driver able to be pushed as a module over a
STREAMS-based pipe end so that Ferry-Clip conformance testing could be performed.  In fact,
Ferry-Clip testing might be better and more flexible than IP-packet-level testing because it is
possible to closely control the timing of arriving packets on a STREAMS-based pipe.  In fact, this
is such a good idea, I think that I will proceed along the Ferry-Clip lines for testing first and
only perform the IP packet-level testing later.

@item
Retest performance using the OpenSS7 Modified Netperf package.

@item
Perform profiling and use the hot text techniques from Linux Fast-STREAMS to make the package run
even faster.

@item
Complete documentation.  Particularly the npi_sctp(7) and tpi_sctp(7) manual pages.  The xti_sctp
manual page is fairly complete but needs updating in several places where there are gaps.
