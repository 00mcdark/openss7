.B rmux
\- Remote Multiplexing Driver for STREAMS
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B RMUX
is a remote multiplexing driver using SCTP,
.[
rfc2960
.]
.[
rfc3309
.]
.[
rfc4460
.]
.BR sctp (4).
Its purpose is to make remote
.IR STREAMS (9)
devices appear to be local STREAMS devices, permitting distribution of protocol stacks over multiple
hosts in a fashion transparent to applications programs.  The
.B RMUX
driver uses SCTP,
.BR sctp (4),
as its transport protocol and a slim protocol to achieve transparency to the STREAMS user interface.
.PP
.B RMUX
uses a single SCTP association to the remote host to provide access to all of the STREAMS devices on
that host.
.B RMUX
is a multiplexing driver that links SCTP associations beneath it using a control Stream during the
configuration process.  Device numbers on the upper mutiplex (both major and minor) are configured
during the configuration process.
.PP
.B RMUX
is cleaner than SIGTRAN for use within distributed OpenSS7 protocol stack systems.  Instead
of being specific to a protocol layer service primitive interface,
.B RMUX
is general purpose and
can be use to export the User-Provider interface for _any_ protocol module.
.PP
Non-STREAMS based systems that have SCTP can open and manage STREAMS devices as long as they use
the
.B RMUX
protocol directly.
.PP
By chaining devices between hosts, it is possible to provide redundant paths to the same device.
This accomplished by opening the device multiple times via multiple systems.
.B RMUX
can be configured to understand that multiple upper multiplex Streams are related in this fashion
and can provide automatic failover from one path to another.  Because the acknowledged SCTP NPI
service is used, each encapsulated message can be marked with an identifier and the ultimate
receiving device can remove duplications.
.\"
.SS Open and Close
.PP
When a user opens a configured minor device number, the local
.B RMUX
driver blocks in the
.BR qi_qopen (9)
procedures and communicates with the remote host on a linked SCTP Stream.
The remote
.B RMUX driver has a
daemon process on a control Stream that, upon an indication, opens the requested device,
links it under the
.B RMUX
driver at the remote end and communicates a return status to the requesting end.  The requesting end
wakes the sleeping
.BR qi_qopen (9)
process and returns the appropriate return value.
.PP
Subsequent opens of the local
.B RMUX
Stream that invoke the
.BR qi_qopen (9)
procedure of the local upper multiplex Stream are also communicated to the remote end and the remote
.B RMUX
driver mimics the Stream head open down the module stack and provides the appropriate return value.
.PP
When the user closes the driver,
.B RMUX
blocks the user in the
.BR qi_qclose (9)
procedure,
communicates the close to the remote end.  The daemon at the remote end unlinks and closes the
driver and communicates the close to the remote end.
.PP
Users cannot rely on the device numbering of opened Streams.
.PP
Messages passed to the Stream head that are absorbed by the Stream head (e.g.,
.BR M_ERROR (9),
.BR M_SIG "(9), " M_SETOPTS (9))
on open may be lost for the remote system.  Using knowledge about the Linux Fast-STREAMS
implementation it is possible to determine whether
.BR M_HANGUP "(9) or " M_SETOPTS (9)
as performed while linking.
.\"
.SS I_LINK and I_PLINK
.PP
Local users can also link both remote and local Streams under a remote multiplexing driver.  When
linking a Stream, it is communicated to the remote
.B RMUX
during the linking process and the remote
.B RMUX
daemon opens a special minor device on its upper multiplex and links it under the remote driver.
When linking a remote Stream on the same host, the corresponding Stream on the remote
.B RMUX
lower multiplex is unlinked and linked under the appropriate driver.  When linking a remote Stream
on a different host is the same a linking a local Stream.
.\"
.SS I_PUSH and I_POP
.PP
Local users can push modules onto remote Streams; however, the module pushed is a local module.
.PP
Module pushing is problematic in that there may be module mismatches between the local and remote
system.  Where closer control is required a workaround is to use the autopush mechanism on the
remote system instead (have modules autopushed on opened drivers instead of explicitly pushed by the
local user).  Another workaround is to use a specialized set of R_PUSH, R_POP, input-output controls
that mirror the
.IR I_PUSH "(7), " I_POP (7),
input-output controls for STREAMS.  The problem with this later approach is that the user must be
aware that an
.B RMUX
Stream is being used.  (Unless we provide a Stream head option to pass
.BR I_PUSH "(7) and " I_POP (7)
input-output
controls down to the driver.  This later approach is probably best as it also allows remote Streams
on to be linked under multiplexing drivers on the same host.)
.PP
The remote system will have to unlink the Stream, push or pop the module and then relink it.
.\"
.SS STREAMS Message Handling
.PP
All STREAMS messages are encapsulated and sent to the remote
.BR RMUX .
The multiple stream capability of SCTP is utilized fully.  When a remote Stream is established, an
SID is assigned to each of queue band number for the Stream.  Normal priority messages (e.g,
.BR M_PROTO (9))
are sent using ordered delivery on the SID that corresponds to the queue band.  High
priority messages (e.g,
.BR M_PCPROTO (9))
are sent using unordered (???) delivery on the SID that corresponds to high priority messages
(likely SID 0).
.PP
Numbering, flags and structure layout.  It is likely that the same STREAMS implementation is
necessary on both the sending and receiving system.  In particular, the remote driver must
understand 32-bit and 64-bit flags for input-output controls.  Where incompatibilities exist, the
module or driver must refrain from using those facilities.
.PP
Modules and drivers cannot have knowledge of, nor rely upon, duplicated message blocks, special
alignment or "hidden" data in a message block between modules.  (Not much of an issue as they
shouldn't anyway.)
.\"
.SS Queueing
.PP
Local Streams representing remote devices will always have service procedures.
.PP
Modules and drivers cannot have knowledge of, nor rely upon, the context in which messages are
passed to neighbouring modules and drivers.
.\"
.SS Flow Control
.PP
Flow control along the Stream is accomplished using specialized
.B RMUX
messages that indicate the band for which flow control is effected.  The receiving
.B RMUX
driver places a specalized blocking message on the appropriate queue pair to establish backpressure.
Additional
.B RMUX
message are used for backenabling and also indicate the band for which the backenable has occurred
(resulting in the removal of the blocking message from the associated queue band).  In this way,
STREAMS flow control operates transparently.
.PP
A better approach to flow control would be to leave messages on the local sending queue until they
are acknowledged received by the remote end (using the acknowledged data service of the NPI
interface to SCTP).  This is cleaner in that it does not require blocking messages.  It does still
require a back-enable message, but without band number.
.\"
.SS Loss of Communications
.PP
All users must properly handle
.BR M_ERROR "(9) and " M_HANGUP (9)
messages.  If communication is lost to the remote
.BR RMUX ,
all corresponding local Streams will be hungup with
.BR M_HANGUP (9).
