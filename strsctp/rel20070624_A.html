This release is the eighth separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP driver that was formerly
present in the OpenSS7 SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP <a href="strss7_pkg.html">strss7</a> package.  The
networking driver (<code>streams-sctp</code>) is provided, as well as NPI, TPI and XTI header files
for SCTP operation.  The package contains the necessary manual pages and other documentation for
SCTP components in a separate autoconf tarball.

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.8 of the STREAMS SCTP <em>strsctp</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP (`strsctp') is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP - RFC 2960) for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  It is based on the same protocol
engine core as the OpenSS7 Linux Native (Sockets) version of OpenSS7 SCTP.  The package provides a
STREAMS SCTP driver for use with SIGTRAN components of the OpenSS7 stack.

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
