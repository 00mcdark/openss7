strsctp-0.9.2.5 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

STREAMS SCTP (strsctp) is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP - RFC 2960) for Linux Fast-STREAMS.
It is based on the same protocol engine core as the Linux Native
(Sockets) version of OpenSS7 SCTP.

This release is another separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP
driver that was formerly present in the OpenSS7 SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP
strss7 package <http://www.openss7.org/strss7_pkg.html>.  The networking
driver (streams-sctp) is provided, as well as NPI, TPI and XTI header
files for SCTP operation.  The package contains the necessary manual
pages and other documentation for SCTP components in a separate autoconf
tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).  It
includes:

 - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support
   32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary
   compatibility should not have been disrupted.  At the same time as
   the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of the IO
   controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
   N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

 This is a public alpha release of the package.
 
 Please see README-alpha in the release, or
 <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.5/README-alpha>.

These components were formerly only contained in the OpenSS7 SS7/SIGTRAN
/ISDN/VoIP strss7 package <http://www.openss7.org/strss7_pkg.html>,
however, this tarball configures, builds and installs them separately in
case you wish to use these components separate from our strss7 releases
(e.g. on their own).

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strsctp package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strsctp_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.5/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.5/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strsctp.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strsctp_manual.html>).
