Package strsctp-0.9.2.6 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP (strsctp) is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP - RFC 2960) for Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  It is based on the same protocol engine core as the
OpenSS7 Linux Native (Sockets) version of OpenSS7 SCTP.  The package
provides a STREAMS SCTP driver for use with SIGTRAN components of the
OpenSS7 stack.

This package is a separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP package
that was formerly present in the `strss7' package.  The networking
driver, sctp(4), is provided, as well as NPI, TPI and XTI header files
for SCTP operation.  The package contains the necessary manual pages and
other documentation for SCTP components in a separate autoconf tarball.
This release is also part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(openss7-0.9.2.D).

The package currently includes the following STREAMS kernel modules and
drivers:

     - streams_sctp.ko /dev/sctp_n /dev/sctp_t
     - streams_tpiperf.ko "tpiperf"

sctp(4)
     The sctp(4) STREAMS driver is the primary STREAMS pseudo-device
     driver that implements the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
     (SCTP) described in RFC 2960 and RFC 4460.

tpiperf(4)
     The tpiperf(4) STREAMS module contians the TPI performance test
     module.  This STREAMS module is primarily for performance testing
     of the TPI interface of the sctp(4) driver.


The OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) protocol stack components and
applications for the Linux Fast-STREAMS environment.

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  No significant defect
corrections or development has been applied, however, significant
testing has been performed.  This release is a stable production release
for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of this
release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - This release was tested at the 10th SCTP Interop in Vancouver,
     Canada, at the beginning of August, 2006.  This implementation
     showed well and interoperated successfully with all implementations
     present.  Interoperability testing was performed using Linux
     Fast-STREAMS on the latest, at the time, Fedora Core 5 kernel
     (2.6.18) and Ubuntu 6.06 Server (2.6.15).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     `strsctp' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see
the strsctp package page (http://www.openss7.org/strsctp_pkg.html).

See `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.6/ChangeLog' and
`http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.6/NEWS' in the release
for more information.  Also, see the `strsctp.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html `http://www.openss7.org/strsctp_manual.html').
