strsctp-0.9.2.5 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

STREAMS SCTP (strsctp) is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP - RFC 2960) for Linux Fast-STREAMS.
It is based on the same protocol engine core as the Linux Native
(Sockets) version of OpenSS7 SCTP.

This release is another separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP
driver that was formerly present in the OpenSS7 SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP
strss7 package <http://www.openss7.org/strss7_pkg.html>.  The networking
driver (streams-sctp) is provided, as well as NPI, TPI and XTI header
files for SCTP operation.  The package contains the necessary manual
pages and other documentation for SCTP components in a separate autoconf
tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).  It
includes:

 - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support
   32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary
   compatibility should not have been disrupted.  At the same time as
   the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of the IO
   controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
   N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

 This is a public alpha release of the package.
 
 Please see README-alpha in the release, or
 <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.5/README-alpha>.

These components were formerly only contained in the OpenSS7 SS7/SIGTRAN
/ISDN/VoIP strss7 package <http://www.openss7.org/strss7_pkg.html>,
however, this tarball configures, builds and installs them separately in
case you wish to use these components separate from our strss7 releases
(e.g. on their own).

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strsctp package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strsctp_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.5/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.5/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strsctp.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strsctp_manual.html>).

strsctp-0.9.2.6 was released under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP (strsctp) is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP - RFC 2960) for Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  It is based on the same protocol engine core as the
OpenSS7 Linux Native (Sockets) version of OpenSS7 SCTP.  The package
provides a STREAMS SCTP driver for use with SIGTRAN components of the
OpenSS7 stack.

This package is a separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP package
that was formerly present in the strss7 package.  The networking driver,
sctp(4), is provided, as well as NPI, TPI and XTI header files for SCTP
operation.  The package contains the necessary manual pages and other
documentation for SCTP components in a separate autoconf tarball.  This
release is also part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  No significant defect
corrections or development has been applied, however, significant
testing has been performed.  This release is a stable production release
for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of this
release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - This release was tested at the 10th SCTP Interop in Vancouver,
     Canada, at the beginning of August, 2006.  This implementation
     showed well and interoperated successfully with all implementations
     present.  Interoperability testing was performed using Linux
     Fast-STREAMS on the latest, at the time, Fedora Core 5 kernel
     (2.6.18) and Ubuntu 6.06 Server (2.6.15).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The make installcheck target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     strsctp now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new --with-optimize option
     to configure to accomplish this.

   - Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

 This is a public production release of the package.  This release
 deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade before reporting bugs on
 previous releases.
 
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for

RPMs.
