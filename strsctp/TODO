Things to do:

   * The strsctp package is quite stable and mature as of
     strsctp-0.9.2.2 and most of the things that remain to be done are
     rigorous conformance and performance testing.

   - SCTP Interoperability testing.  Take the STREAMS package to the
     SCTP Interop tests at UBC and perform interoperability testing.

     _*Complete*_

     Tested perfect against all functional implementations present.
     Passed 720 Mbps compiled with no optimizations and debugging
     assertions turned on.  Still have to go through the logs and
     collect warnings and investigate them.  Still have to complete
     optimized performance testing.

   - Work recent SCTP I-G changes into the code.

   - Testing and Validation using existing test suites.

   - Writing new IP-packet-level conformance test suites.

   - It would also be an idea to make the STREAMS SCTP Driver able to
     be pushed as a module over a STREAMS-based pipe end so that
     Ferry-Clip conformance testing could be performed.  In fact,
     Ferry-Clip testing might be better and more flexible than
     IP-packet-level testing because it is possible to closely control
     the timing of arriving packets on a STREAMS-based pipe.  In fact,
     this is such a good idea, I think that I will proceed along the
     Ferry-Clip lines for testing first and only perform the IP
     packet-level testing later.

   - Retest performance using the OpenSS7 Modified Netperf package.

   - Perform profiling and use the hot text techniques from Linux
     Fast-STREAMS to make the package run even faster.

   - Complete documentation.  Particularly the npi_sctp(7) and
     tpi_sctp(7) manual pages.  The xti_sctp manual page is fairly
     complete but needs updating in several places where there are gaps.
