The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP package.

 Major changes for release strsctp-0.9.2.8
------------------------------------------

This release is a stable production release.  This release is primarily
a maintenance release to support recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).

   - Supports build on Ubuntu 7.04.

   - Updated to gettext 0.16.1.

   - Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 and
     2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 kernel.

   - Supports build on Fedora Core 6.

   - Support for recent distributions and tool chains.


 Major changes for release strsctp-0.9.2.7
------------------------------------------

This release is a stable production release for `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.
This release is primarily a maintenance release to support recent
distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Fixed a buffer double-free bug when out-of-the-blue messages were
     being processed on non-listening Streams.  See
     `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.8/BUGS' in the
     release for more information.

   - Fixed a rather noxious locking bug in sctp_cleanup_read() that was
     suppressing interrupts across a putnext() call.  See
     `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsctp-0.9.2.8/BUGS' in the
     release for more information.

   - Improvements to the common build environment with better support
     for standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

   - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.

   - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number
     as unpacked by separate tarball.


 Major changes for release strsctp-0.9.2.6
------------------------------------------

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  No significant defect
corrections or development has been applied, however, significant
testing has been performed.  This release is a stable production
release for `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.  Support for `LiS' is deprecated as
of this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - This release was tested at the 10th SCTP Interop in Vancouver,
     Canada, at the beginning of August, 2006.  This implementation
     showed well and inter-operated successfully with all
     implementations present.  Interoperability testing was performed
     using Linux Fast-STREAMS on the latest, at the time, Fedora Core 5
     kernel (2.6.18) and Ubuntu 6.06 Server (2.6.15).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versions to all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Updated `init' scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.
     `strsctp' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: `LiS' cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

 Major changes for release strsctp-0.9.2.5
------------------------------------------

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

   - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to
     support 32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.
     Binary compatibility should not have been disrupted.  At the same
     time as the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of
     the IO controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

   - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

   - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs
     on x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc
     4.0.2 compiler warnings.

   - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
     mailing list.

   - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
     Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
     N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

   - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
     x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

This is a public alpha release of the package.

 Major changes for release strsctp-0.9.2.4
------------------------------------------

This is primarily a bug fixes release and corrections resulting from
testing.  This is a major bug fix release.  The previous release was
largely untested.  This release has been verified (conformance test
suite passes) for operation with `Linux Fast-STREAMS'
(`streams-0.7a.4').

 Major changes for release strsctp-0.9.2.3
------------------------------------------

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
`RPM' release numbers will be `-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)' and all `Debian'
release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches and release
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable
release suffix for your organization.  We leave `Debian' release number
`_1' reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the
`.dsc' file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
distribution support.  The package also supports both `LiS-2.18.1' as
well as `streams-0.7a' on both kernels.

 Major changes for release strsctp-0.9.2-2
------------------------------------------

Not publicly released.

 Initial release strsctp-0.9.2-1
--------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strsctp' release.

Not publicly released.
