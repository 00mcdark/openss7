7.2 Problem Reports
===================

7.2.1 Problem Report Guidelines
-------------------------------

Problem reports in the following categories should include a log file
as indicated in the table below:

`./configure'
     A problem with the configuration process occurs that causes the
     `./configure' command to fail.  The problem report must include
     the `config.log' file that was generated by `configure'.

`make compile.log'
     A problem with the build process occurs that causes the `make'
     command to fail.  Perform `make clean' and then `make compile.log'
     and attach the `config.log' and `compile.log' files to the problem
     report.

`make check.log'
     A problem occurs with the `make check' target that causes it to
     fail.  Perform `make check-clean check.log' and attach the
     `config.log', `compile.log' and `check.log' files to the problem
     report.

`sudo make install.log'
     A problem occurs with `sudo make install' that causes it to fail.
     Perform `sudo make uninstall' and `sudo make install.log' and
     attach the `config.log', `compile.log', `check.log', and
     `install.log' files to the problem report.

`[sudo] make installcheck.log'
     A problem occurs with the `make installcheck' target that causes
     the test suite to fail.  Attach the resulting
     `tests/testsuite.log' and `installcheck.log' file to the problem
     report.  There is no need to attach the other files as they are
     included in `tests/testsuite.log'.

`[sudo] make uninstall.log'
     A problem occurs with the `make uninstall' target that causes the
     test suite to fail.  Perform `sudo make uninstall.log' and attach
     the `config.log', `compile.log', `check.log', `install.log',
     `installcheck.log', `tests/testsuite.log' and `uninstall.log' file
     to the problem report.

`[sudo] make remove.log'
     A problem occurs with the `make remove' target that causes the
     test suite to fail.  Perform `sudo make remove.log' and attach the
     `config.log', `compile.log', `check.log', `install.log',
     `installcheck.log', `tests/testsuite.log' and `remove.log' file to
     the problem report.


For other problems that occur during the use of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS
SCTP' package, please write a test case for the test suite that
recreates the problem if one does not yet exist and provide a test
program patch with the problem report.  Also include whatever log files
are generated by the kernel (`cmn_err(9)') or by the `strerr(8)' or
`strace(1)' facilities (`strlog(9)').

7.2.2 Generating Problem Reports
--------------------------------

`The OpenSS7 Project' uses the `GNU GNATS' system for problem
reporting.  Although the `send-pr' tool from the `GNU GNATS' package
can be used for bug reporting to the project's `GNATS' database using
electronic mail, it is not always convenient to download and install the
`GNATS' system to gain access to the `send-pr' tool.

Therefore, the `OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP' package provides the `send-pr'
shell script that can be used for problem reporting.  The `send-pr'
shell script can invoked directly and is a work-alike for the `GNU'
`send-pr' tool.

The `send-pr' tool takes the same flags and can be used in the same
fashion, however, whereas `send-pr' is an interactive tool(1),
`send-pr' is also able to perform batch processing.  Whereas `send-pr'
takes its field information from local databases or from using the
`query-pr' C-language program to query a remote database, the `send-pr'
tool has the field database internal to the tool.

Problem reports can be generate using `make', see `Problem Report
Targets', in the manual.  An example of how simple it is to generate a
problem report is illustrated in *Note autopr:ex0::.  

     % make pr
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: send-pr:  send-pr was invoked to generate an external report.  An
     SEND-PR: automated problem report has been created in the file named
     SEND-PR: 'problem.pr' in the current directory.  This problem report can
     SEND-PR: be sent to bugs@openss7.org by calling this script as
     SEND-PR: '/home/brian/os7/scripts/send-pr --file="problem.pr"'.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: It is possible to edit some of the fields before sending on the
     SEND-PR: problem report.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY.  See
     SEND-PR: the file 'COPYING' in the top level directory.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: Please do not send confidential information to the bug report
     SEND-PR: address.  Inspect the file 'problem.pr' for confidential
     SEND-PR: information before mailing.
     SEND-PR:
     % vim problem.pr  # <--- follow instructions at head of file
     % make send-pr

Example 7.6: _Invoking Problem Report Generation_


Using the `make pr' target to generate a problem report has the
advantages that it will assemble any available `*.log' files in the
build directory and attach them to the problem report.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) `send-pr' launches the user's EDITOR to edit the problem report
before submitting it.

7.2.3 Automatic Problem Reports
-------------------------------

The `OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP' package also provides a feature for
automatic problem report generation that meets the problem report
submission guidelines detailed in the preceding sections.

Whenever a logging makefile target (see `Logging Targets', in the
manual) is invoked, if the primary target fails, the `send-pr' shell
script is invoked to automatically generate a problem report file
suitable for the corresponding target (as described above under see
`Problem Report Guidelines', in the manual).  An example is shown in
*Note autopr:ex2::.

     % make compile.log
     ...
     ...
     make[5]: *** [libXNSdrvs_a-ip.o] Error 1
     make[5]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4/strxns'
     make[4]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
     make[4]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4/strxns'
     make[3]: *** [all] Error 2
     make[3]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4/strxns'
     make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
     make[2]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4'
     make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
     make[1]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4'
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: send-pr:  Make target compile.log failed in the compile stage.  An
     SEND-PR: automated problem report has been created in the file named
     SEND-PR: 'problem.pr' in the current directory.  This problem report can
     SEND-PR: be sent to bugs@openss7.org by calling 'make send-pr'.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: It is possible to edit some of the fields before sending on the
     SEND-PR: problem report.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY.  See
     SEND-PR: the file 'COPYING' in the top level directory.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: Please do not send confidential information to the bug report
     SEND-PR: address.  Inspect the file 'problem.pr' for confidential
     SEND-PR: information before mailing.
     SEND-PR:
     % vim problem.pr  # <--- follow instructions at head of file
     % make send-pr

Example 7.7: _Problem Report from Failed Logging Target_


7.2.4 Stand Alone Problem Reports
---------------------------------

The `OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP' package installs the `send-pr' script and
its configuration file `send-pr.config' in `${libexecdir}/strsctp'
along with the validation `testsuite', see see `Test Suites', in the
manual.  As with the `testsuite', this allows the `send-pr' script to
be used for problem report generation on an installed system that does
not have a build directory.

An example of invoking the package `testsuite' and then generating a
problem report for failed cases is shown in *Note Example 7.7:
autopr:ex2.

     % [sudo] /usr/libexec/strsctp/testsuite
     % # test cases failed...
     % /usr/libexec/strsctp/send-pr
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: send-pr:  send-pr was invoked to generate an external report.  An
     SEND-PR: automated problem report has been created in the file named
     SEND-PR: 'problem.pr' in the current directory.  This problem report can
     SEND-PR: be sent to bugs@openss7.org by calling this script as
     SEND-PR: '/usr/libexec/strsctp/send-pr --file problem.pr'.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: It is possible to edit some of the fields before sending on the
     SEND-PR: problem report.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY.  See
     SEND-PR: the file 'COPYING' in the top level directory.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: Please do not send confidential information to the bug report
     SEND-PR: address.  Inspect the file 'problem.pr' for confidential
     SEND-PR: information before mailing.
     SEND-PR:
     % vim problem.pr  # <--- follow instructions at head of file
     % /usr/libexec/strsctp/send-pr --file problem.pr

Example 7.8: _Invoking `send-pr' Directly_


The advantage of the approach shown in the example is that the
`send-pr' script is capable of collecting the `testsuite.log' file and
the failed test cases and debugging scripts from the `testsuite.dir'
directory and including them in the problem report, as well as all
package pertinent information from the installed `send-pr.config'.
