#   changed them on installation, we save an original copy in $f.dpkg-old.
#   Therefore, if $f.dpkg-old exists, copy it back.
#
#   FIXME: For the rpm version this is much more than this.  It is moving back
#	common configuration files that were altered by the installation.  Short
#	circuited for now.
