#
# This is a fresh installation of the package for @kversion@.  Either the
# package has never been installed before, or a purge was performed on the
# package after it was removed (unlikely, but possible).  Actions that need to
# be performed are as follows:
#
# The preinst script will:
#
# 1.  Seek out and remove any non-deb or old LiS installations.
# 2.  Remove any weak links by calling openss7-update --remove-kernel @kversion@
# 3.  Perform a depmod so that no attempt is made to load the kernel modules
#     that are about to be installed.  Note that this may result in an error
#     because client modules may be present.
# 4.  Do not stop any running subsystems regardless of whether @kversion@ is the
#     running kernel.
# 5.  Touch /.openss7-update-@kversion@ to indicate to init scripts that
#     openss7-update --boot-kernel @kversion@ should be run on reboot.
#
# The postinst script will:
#
# 1.  Relink installed kernel modules for the running kernel if required.  This
#     is performed with openss7-update --add-modules @kversion@.
# 2.  Perform a weak update using openss7-update --add-modules @kversion@.  Note
#     that this will not affect the running kernel when @kversion@ is other than
#     the running kernel.
# 3.  Perform a depmod so that kernel module dependencies are proper. (This will
#     be performed by openss7-update.)
# 4.  Can start init scripts for the running kernel if desired and they are not
#     already running.  The user can be prompted using debconf.  However, it is
#     best to leave them in their previous state by default.
# 5.  If init scripts are running or kernel modules are loaded and the
#     installation is for the running kernel, warn the user that a restart of
#     the STREAMS subsystems is recommended.  The user can be prompted using
#     debconf.  However, it is best to leave them in their previous state by
#     default.
#
# Note that if the package is not configured, kernel modules will be installed
# in the directories; however, they will not be included in the depmod files and
# therefore will not load.  If the kernel should be rebooted a depmod on reboot
# will include these modules, however, the postinst actions will be performed by
# the init scripts on shutdown and reboot if necessary (as signalled by the
# presence of the /.openss7-update-@kversion@ file) and modules will be properly
# linked either before or after reboot and depmod performed again when necessary
# before the init scripts attempt to start the subsystem.

#
# This is an upgrade of the package for @kversion@.  An older version of the

#
# The prerm script will:
#
# 1.  Remove any weak links to the modules that are about to be removed (for
#     kernels other than @kversion@) by calling openss7-update --remove-modules
#     @kversion@.  This may as last step remove the modules themselves.  The
#     openss7-update script can be passed the EVR of the modules so that they
#     may be identified by their srcversion.
# 2.  If the running kernel was linked to the modules being removed, those
#     symbolic links must be removed and a depmod performed so that the running
#     kernel will not attempt to load any modules that are about to be
#     installed.  Note that this may result in an error because client modules
#     may be present.
# 3.  Do not stop any running subsystems regardless of whether @kversion@ is the

# 3.  Do not stop any running subsystems regardless of whether @kversion@ is the
#     running kernel.
# 4.  Touch /.openss7-update-@kversion@ to indicate to init scripts that
#     openss7-update --boot-kernel @kversion@ should be run on reboot.
#
# The postrm script will:
#
# 1.  Do nothing.  The new modules could be relinked at this stage, but it is
#     not wise to use scripts is a questionable state to relink newer version
#     modules.
#
# The postinst script will:
#
# 1.  Relink installed kernel modules for the running kernel if required.  This
#     is performed with openss7-update --add-modules @kversion@.
# 2.  Perform a weak update using openss7-update --add-modules @kversion@.  Note
#     that this will not affect the running kernel when @kversion@ is other than
