Description: virtual base package.
 The @PACKAGE_LCNAME@ package includes kernel modules, STREAMS drivers,
 modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and
 development environment for the development and execution of
 @PACKAGE_TITLE@ drivers, components and applications for the STREAMS
 environment.  This distribution is currently applicable to 2.6
 kernels and is validated for ix86, x86_64, ppc and ppc64
 architectures, but should build and install well for other
 architectures.  This package includes the following binary
 packages:
 .
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@
   -- copyright info, change logs, virtual base package.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-repo
   -- apt repository source definitions.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-base
   -- admin and user docs, man pages, manual, info files,
      devices, init scripts, configs, mibs, test utils.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-doc
   -- developer and programmer docs, man pages, papers,
      projects, manuals, info files, javadoc.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-lib
   -- shared libraries and utilities.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-devel
   -- headers, static libraries, developer man pages.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-debuginfo
   -- binary application and library debug info.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-debugsource
   -- binary application and library debug source.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-@kversion@
   -- kernel modules.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-@kversion@-debuginfo
   -- kernel module debug info.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-@kversion@-debugsource
   -- kernel module debug source.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-@kversion@-source
   -- configured source.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-java
   -- JAIN java modules, JNI/CNI libraries, and native Java
      modules.
 - @PACKAGE_LCNAME@-javadoc
   -- Javadoc documentation for JAIN APIs and implementation.
 .
 The @PACKAGE_LCNAME@ binary package provides documentation, device
 definitions, Sys V init scripts and configuration files, SNMP
 MIB definitions, and test suites.
 .
 Documentation includes text, html, info and pdf (texinfo)
 documentation and manual for the development of applications,
 modules and drivers, as well as the installation and reference
 manual.  Also included are extensive manual pages for the
 entire package, including manual pages for commands,
 administrative utilities, user interfaces, an kernel functions.
 .
 Device definitions are necessary to run applications programs
 and utilities.  On older systems, this binary package includes
 the executable for creating devices from init scripts.  Init
 scripts load kernel modules, create devices, and apply system
 configuration customizations at boot.
 .
 SNMP MIB definitions for managing the package with external
 SNMP management tools.  Autotest validation testsuites are used
 for validating and troubleshooting.  Also included is the
 send-pr script for generating and submitting problem reports to
 bugs@openss7.org.
