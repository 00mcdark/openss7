#   is up to the new-postinst "configure" stage or an appropriate trigger.

# postrm_tcllibs() - After removal or upgrade, the tcl module index files should
#   be removed.  Note that after removal there are no tcl modules around and the
#   directories can be removed as well.  For upgrade, however, the tcl modules
#   still exist, but all index files for them can be removed.
#

#   dlmod files to .dpkg-orig in preparation for an abort, but dpkg does not
#   know about that so remove them here.

#   will have been removed, however, non-deb programs or debs that do not
#   properly rely upon this package will not be stopped.
