# Auxiliary functions:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# postrm_libraries() - When complete removal, perform a ldconfig after the
#   libraries have been removed to flush them from the ldconfig cache.  Note
#   that this should not be done on upgrade, because building the ldconfig cache
#   is up to the new-postinst "configure" stage or an appropriate trigger.
#
postrm_libraries () { :
    if which ldconfig >/dev/null 2>&1; then
	ldconfig || true
    fi
}
#
# postrm_tcllibs() - After removal or upgrade, the tcl module index files should
#   be removed.  Note that after removal there are no tcl modules around and the
#   directories can be removed as well.  For upgrade, however, the tcl modules
#   still exist, but all index files for them can be removed.
#
postrm_tcllibs () { :
    # FIXME: figure out which files to remove
}
#
# postrm_lib_remove() - After a removal, do a ldconfig and remove the indexes
#   for the tcl libraries and modules.
#
postrm_lib_remove () { :
    postrm_libraries
    postrm_tcllibs
}
#
# postrm_lib_upgrade() - During an upgrade, we should probably remove our tcl
#   modules index files because dpkg does not know about them.  The new-postinst
#   "configure" will generate new index files for any tcl modules that were
#   also in the new version.
