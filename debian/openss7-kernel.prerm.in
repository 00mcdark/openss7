#
# What we used to do here was check whether the removal was for the running
# kernel or not.  If it was for the running kernel we used to use initscripts
# (when available) to shutdown and remove the STREAMS subsystem and kernel
# modules; or manually when initscripts are not available.
#
# Two things have changed: it is not so simple to check whether the running
# kernel will be affected.
#
# What we must tell the update script here is that we are about to
# remove openss7 modules for the kernel @kversion@.  Therefore, the
# openss7-modules script should determine which symbolic links point to
# the openss7 modules being removed and whether to remove them.
#
# There are several cases that need to be dealt with separately:
#
# We are removing the last openss7 modules in the system:
#
#   We might want to interact with the user before removing openss7
#   modules in this case, particularly when the running kernel is
#   affected.  However, this can be handled by the openss7-base
#   package's prerm script.
#
# We are removing only one kernel version of openss7 modules from the
# system:
#
#   There are two situations in this case: 1) the running kernel is
#   affected by the removal; 2) the running kernel is not affected.
