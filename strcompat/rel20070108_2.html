This is the fourth separate OpenSS7 Project release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility package
that was formerly present in the Linux Fast-STREAMS streams-0.7a.2 release package.  These
compatibility modules provide source level compatibility with AIX, HPUX, OSF/1, MacOT, Mentat, SUX,
Solaris, SUPER/UX, IRIX, LiS, UnixWare, UXP/V and SVR 4.2 STREAMS.  The package contains all the
necessary manual pages and other documentation in an autoconf tarball.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is a stable, production grade release for Linux Fast- STREAMS and is part of the
OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is primarily a maintenance release.  Some functionality of the package has been tested
by its use in other packages and some defects corrected.  This release is a stable production
release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of this release.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules and
drivers.  The `make installcheck' target will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for LiS.</li>
<li>Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux
Fast-STREAMS only.</li>
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES
9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new --with-optimize option to configure to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>

<em>This is public production grade release of the package: it deprecates previous releases.  Please
    upgrade before reporting problems with previous releases.</em>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.4 of the STREAMS Compatibility Modules <em>strcompat</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility package provides the ability for Linux Fast-STREAMS to exhibit
source level compatibility with a wide range of UNIX STREAMS implementations.  Also, it provides LiS
source, and some 2.18.0 binary, compatibility for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The objective of the package
is to provide source level compatibility with a wide range of UNIX STREAMS implementations
permitting drivers and modules to port easily to Linux Fast-STREAMS from any other STREAMS
implementation, making it possible to release drivers and modules from a single UNIX code base with
minimal localisms for Linux.

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds rpms for a
wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
