SUX, Solaris, SUPER/UX, IRIX, LiS, UnixWare, UXP/V and SVR 4.2 STREAMS.  The package contains all
the necessary manual pages and other documentation in an autoconf tarball.

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.6 of the STREAMS Compatibility Modules <em>strcompat</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility package provides the ability for Linux Fast-STREAMS to exhibit
source level compatibility with a wide range of UNIX STREAMS implementations.  Also, it provides LiS
source, and some 2.18.0 binary, compatibility for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The objective of the package
is to provide source level compatibility with a wide range of UNIX STREAMS implementations
permitting drivers and modules to port easily to Linux Fast-STREAMS from any other STREAMS
implementation, making it possible to release drivers and modules from a single UNIX code base with
minimal localisms for Linux.

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
