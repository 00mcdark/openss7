strcompat-0.9.2.3 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

The STREAMS Compatibility Modules package provides the ability for both
Linux Fast-STREAMS and the deprecated Linux STREAMS (LiS) to exhibit
source level compatibility with a wide range of UNIX STREAMS
implementations.  Also, it provides source compatibility with Linux
Fast-STREAMS for Lis, and LiS (source and some 2.18.0 binary)
compatibility for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The objective of the package is
to provide source level compatibility with a wide range of UNIX STREAMS
implementations permitting drivers and modules to port easily to Linux
Fast-STREAMS from any other STREAMS implementation, making it possible
to release drivers and modules from a single UNIX code base with minimal
localisms for Linux.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's third separate release of the OpenSS7
STREAMS Compatibility Modules that were formerly present in the Linux
Fast-STREAMS streams-0.7a.2 release package.  These compatibility
modules provide source level compatibility with AIX, HPUX, OSF/1, MacOT,
Mentat, SUX, Solaris, SUPER/UX, IRIX, LiS, UnixWare, UXP/V and SVR 4.2
STREAMS.  The package contains all the necessary manual pages and other
documentation in an autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).  It
includes:

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
   N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

  This is public beat test release of the package: it deprecates
  previous releases.  Please upgrade before reporting bugs on previous
  releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strcompat package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strcompat_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and
binary RPMs.

for more information.  Also, see the strcompat.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strcompat_manual.html>).

strcompat-0.9.2.4 was released under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility package provides the ability for Linux
Fast-STREAMS to exhibit source level compatibility with a wide range of
UNIX STREAMS implementations.  Also, it provides LiS source, and some
2.18.0 binary, compatibility for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The objective of
the package is to provide source level compatibility with a wide range
of UNIX STREAMS implementations permitting drivers and modules to port
easily to Linux Fast-STREAMS from any other STREAMS implementation,
making it possible to release drivers and modules from a single UNIX
code base with minimal localisms for Linux.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility package provides compatibility with
the following STREAMS implementations:

     - OpenSS7 variants
     - UNIX(R) System V Release 3.2
     - UNIX(R) System V Release 4.2
     - MPS(R) Mentat Portable Streams
     - Solaris(R) 9/SunOS(R) 5.9
     - UnixWare(R) 7.1.3
     - Digital(R) UNIX (OSF/1.2)
     - AIX(R) 5L Version 5.1 Portable STREAMS Environment
     - HP-UX(R) 11.0i v2 STREAMS/UX
     - IRIX(R) 6.5.17
     - Linux STREAMS 2.18.0
     - Linux Fast-STREAMS 0.9.2
     - Mac(R) OS 9 Open Transport

This is the fourth separate OpenSS7 Project release of the OpenSS7
STREAMS Compatibility package that was formerly present in the Linux
Fast-STREAMS streams-0.7a.2 release package.  These compatibility
modules provide source level compatibility with AIX, HPUX, OSF/1, MacOT,
Mentat, SUX, Solaris, SUPER/UX, IRIX, LiS, UnixWare, UXP/V and SVR 4.2
STREAMS.  The package contains all the necessary manual pages and other
documentation in an autoconf tarball.

This release is a stable, production grade release for Linux Fast-
STREAMS and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  Some functionality of
the package has been tested by its use in other packages and some
defects corrected.  This release is a stable production release for
Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.

   - Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including
     debian script corrections.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new --with-optimize option
     to configure to accomplish this.

   - Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

  This is public production grade release of the package: it deprecates
  previous releases.  Please upgrade before reporting bugs on previous
  releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the GNU Public License Version 2.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strcompat package page at

binary RPMs.
