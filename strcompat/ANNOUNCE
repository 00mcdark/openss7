Package strcompat-0.9.2.4 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility package provides the ability for Linux
Fast-STREAMS to exhibit source level compatibility with a wide range of
UNIX STREAMS implementations.  Also, it provides LiS source, and some
2.18.0 binary, compatibility for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The objective of
the package is to provide source level compatibility with a wide range
of UNIX STREAMS implementations permitting drivers and modules to port
easily to Linux Fast-STREAMS from any other STREAMS implementation,
making it possible to release drivers and modules from a single UNIX
code base with minimal localisms for Linux.

These compatibility modules provide source level compatibility with AIX,
HPUX, OSF/1, MacOT, Mentat, SUX, Solaris, SUPER/UX, IRIX, LiS, UnixWare,
UXP/V and SVR 4.2 STREAMS.  The package contains all the necessary
manual pages and other documentation in an autoconf tarball.

The package currently includes the following STREAMS kernel modules and
drivers:(1)

     - streams_os7compat.ko kernel
     - streams_svr3compat.ko kernel
     - streams_svr4compat.ko kernel
     - streams_mpscompat.ko kernel
     - streams_suncompat.ko kernel
     - streams_uw7compat.ko kernel
     - streams_osfcompat.ko kernel
     - streams_aixcompat.ko kernel
     - streams_hpuxcompat.ko kernel
     - streams_irixcompat.ko kernel
     - streams_liscompat.ko kernel
     - streams_lfscompat.ko kernel
     - streams_maccompat.ko kernel

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility package provides compatibility with
the following STREAMS implementations:

     * OpenSS7 variants
     * UNIX(R) System V Release 3.2
     * UNIX(R) System V Release 4.2
     * MPS(R) Mentat Portable Streams
     * Solaris(R) 9/SunOS(R) 5.9
     * UnixWare(R) 7.1.3
     * Digital(R) UNIX (OSF/1.2)
     * AIX(R) 5L Version 5.1 Portable STREAMS Environment
     * HP-UX(R) 11.0i v2 STREAMS/UX
     * IRIX(R) 6.5.17
     * Linux STREAMS 2.18.0
     * Linux Fast-STREAMS 0.9.2
     * Mac(R) OS 9 Open Transport

These compatibility modules compile as kernel modules and will be demand
loaded into the kernel when used by a specific STREAMS module or driver.
The compatibility modules ease porting of STREAMS modules and drivers
from other Operating Systems to Linux.  strcompat-0.9.2.4 was released
under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

This is the fourth separate OpenSS7 Project release of the OpenSS7
STREAMS Compatibility package.  The package was originally present in
the Linux Fast-STREAMS streams-0.7a.2 release package, but has been
separated for four releases.

This release is a stable, production grade release for Linux
Fast-STREAMS and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(openss7-0.9.2.D).  It deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade
before reporting bugs on previous releases.

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  Some functionality of
the package has been tested by its use in other packages and some
defects corrected.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.

   - Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including
     debian script corrections.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strcompat package page (http://www.openss7.org/strcompat_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strcompat-0.9.2.4/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strcompat-0.9.2.4/NEWS in the release
for more information.  Also, see the `strcompat.pdf' manual in the
release (also in html http://www.openss7.org/strcompat_manual.html).
