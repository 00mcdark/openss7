.SH NAME

\- stop a timer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SUN_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi>
.br
.B #include <sys/sunddi.h>
.HP
.BI "clock_t quntimeout(queue_t *" q ", timeout_id_t " toid );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue with which the original call to
.BR qtimeout (9)
was associated.
.TP
.I toid
the non-zero timeout call id returned by the associated call to
.BR qtimeout (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR quntimeout ()
cancels the timeout callback that was initiated using
.BR qtimeout (9).
.I toid
is the timeout callback identifier that was returned from a previous call to
.BR qtimeout (9)
with the queue
.IR q .
.PP
.BR quntimeout ()
is typically used to remove outstanding timeout call when a stream is closing
or to cancel protocol timers.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR quntimeout ()
returns the amount of time left on the timer before the timeout would have
occurred in system ticks.
When the timer was cancelled before expiry, the return value is positive.
When the timer was has already expired, the return value is zero.
When the timer could not be found, the return value is negative.
.PP
The return value should be ignored by portable
programs.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR quntimeout ()
fails if the buffer callback identified by
.I toid
no longer exists (has executed); or,
.I toid
is invalid.
When
.BR quntimeout ()
fails, it returns minus one (-1).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR quntimeout ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR quntimeout ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller of
.BR quntimeout ()
must ensure that the callback function has not returned from running before
calling
.BR quntimeout ().
.PP
Because the module is permitted to unload after calling
.BR quntimeout ()
for all outstanding timer callbacks the call to
.BR quntimeout ()
will not return until either the callback function has completed, or the
callback function has been cancelled.  Therefore the callback function will be
guaranteed not to run once 
.BR quntimeout ()
has returned for all outstanding callbacks.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR quntimeout ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this
symbol.
.PP
.BR untimeout (9)
can be used to cancel a timeout call installed with
.BR qtimeout (9).
.PP
The
.I q
argument to
.BR quntimeout ()
is ignored.
.PP
Because
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses object indices to
.B strevent
structures that expire once the callback function has run, when
.BR untimeout ()
is called, it must be called promptly and should never be called after the callback function has
already completed.  Also, the callback function should remove all global references to
.I toid
so that stale timeout call handles do not exist in the system.
