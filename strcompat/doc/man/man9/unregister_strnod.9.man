\- unregister a \fISTREAMS\fR minor device node

implementation specific.
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strconf.h>
.HP
.BI "int unregister_strnod(struct cdevsw *" cdev ", minor_t " minor);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I cdev
a pointer to the
.BR cdevsw (9)
.I STREAMS
character device switch table entry representing the
.I STREAMS
driver from which to unregister the minor device node.
.TP
.I minor
the minor device number from which to unregister the device node;
when specified as minus one
.RB ( -1 ),
.I STREAMS
is to instead unregister all registered minor device nodes.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR unregister_strnod ()
unregisters the minor device node associated with minor device number,
.IR minor ,
from the
.I STREAMS
driver defined by
.IR cdev .
The minor device number must have previously been successfully registered to
.I cdev
under minor device number
.I minor
with a successful call to
.BR register_strnod (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR unregister_strnod ()
is use to unregister a specialized device minor node previously created and
registered with a successful call to
.BR register_strnod (9).
For each successful call to
.BR register_strnod (9),
a corresponding call to
.BR unregister_strnod ()
with the same
.I cdev
and
.I minor
arguments must be performed before a
.I STREAMS
driver is unloaded.
Instead of performing individual corresponding calls to
.BR unregister_strnod (),
.I minor
can be specified as minus one
.RB ( -1 )
to request deregistration of all minor device nodes associated with
.IR cdev .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR unregister_strnod ()
is successful, it returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
on failure, it returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR unregister_strnod ()
fails, it returns a negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBEINVAL\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I cdev
or
.I cdev->d_name
is
.BR NULL ;
or
.I cdev->d_name
is a zero-length string.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I cdev
is not properly registered.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
The
.I minor
argument specifies a single minor device number, but no minor device node is
associated with that minor device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR unregister_strnod ()
can be called at blockable process context.  It is intended to be called in the kernel module
initialization sequence or in a kernel initialization routine.
.BR unregister_strnod ()
may also be called from within a
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR register_strnod ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
\".SH IMPLEMENTATION
\".PP
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Loadable kernel modules that call
.BR register_strnod (9)
when loading
must call
.BR unregister_strnod ()
before unloading.
.BR unregister_strnod ()
must be called with the same value of
.I cdev
and
.I minor
with which
.BR register_strnod (9)
was called (or returned in the case of
.IR minor ).
.PP
Drivers unregistered with
.BR unregister_strnod ()
will also disappear as a device node under
.BR /dev/streams ,
when the
.BR specfs (5)
filesystem has been mounted on
.BR /dev/streams .
