.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I flag
flag indicates whether the caller can sleep awaiting allocation or not.  It
can be one of the following flags (see
.BR kmem_alloc (9)):
.RS
.TP
.B KM_SLEEP
The caller can sleep awaiting allocation of the synchronization variable.
.TP
.B KM_NOSLEEP
The caller cannot sleep awaiting allocation of the synchronization variable.
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
allocates and initializes a syncrhonization variable.  A synchronization
variable is a kernel condition variable.  Allocation can sleep awaiting
availability of sufficient memory with the
.B KM_SLEEP
flag, or can fail and return
.B NULL
in the event of insufficient memory with the
.B KM_NOSLEEP
flag.
See
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
for more information on the
.I flag
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
is used in relation to
.I STREAMS
to allocate a synchronization variable to be used from within a user context.
The synchronization variable could be used within the kernle module's
.BR init_module (9)
or
.BR term_module (9)
routines, or within the
.BR qopen (9)
or
.BR qclose (9)
procedures.
.PP
An alternative to using a syncrhonization variable within the
.BR qopen (9)
and
.BR qclose (9)
procedures is to use the
.IR Solaris \(rg
.BR qwait (9)
or
.BR qwait_sig (9)
DDI functions.

.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the allocated synchronization variable;
when it fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
fails when
.I flags
is set to
.BR KM_NOSLEEP
and suffient memory for the sycnrhonization variable cannot be allocated.
When
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
can be called from any context with the
.BR KM_NOSLEEP
flag.  With the
.BR KM_SLEEP
flag, it many only be called from user context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
defined.

.SH BUGS

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
is compatible with
.B SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.BR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
documents this function as available for use with
.IR STREAMS .
.IP \(em
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
does not support this function.
.IP \(em
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.IR Linux \(rg.
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR SV_ALLOC ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
