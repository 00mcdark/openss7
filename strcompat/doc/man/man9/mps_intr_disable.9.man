.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I plp
a pointer to a priority level location into which to place the former priority level.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
DDI.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
disables interrupts.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
can be called to disable interrupts on the local processor and save the
current processor priority level to the locate specified by the
.I plp
argument.
.PP
Interrupts disbabled with
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
can be re-enabled with
.BR mps_intr_enable (9).
.PP
Each call to
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
should be matched with a corresponding call to
.BR mps_intr_enable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
returns
.BR void ,
and places the previous priority level in the area pointed to by
.BR plp .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
always succeeds.  However, if passed a
.B NULL
pointer, the kernel will panic.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
can be called from
any context, including an interrupt service routine.  Calls can be nested.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
is inherently MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _AIX_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
is, of course, implemented by calling
.BR local_irq_save ()
and storing the
.I flags
in
.IR plp .

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR splstr (9)
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mps_intr_disable ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR aixcompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
