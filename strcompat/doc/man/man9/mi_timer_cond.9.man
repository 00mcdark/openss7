.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'\fBticks\fP\(em'u
.I mp
a pointer to the
.BR M_PCSIG (9)
message block that was allocated with
.BR mi_timer_alloc (9).
This message block can also contain aditional user data.
.TP
.I ticks
the duration, in ticks, before timer expiry.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR OpenSS7 -specific
DDI.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
will schedule the
.I mp
message pointer (which must be created using
.BR mi_timer_alloc (9))
to be placed on the target
.I STREAMS
queue at the specified future time.
.BR mi_timer_valid (9)
must be used in the target queue put or service procedure whenever a
.BR M_PCSIG (9)
message is dequeued.
.PP
If the
.BR M_PCSIG (9)
message block is freshly allocated with
.BR mi_timer_alloc (9)
then
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
schedules a
.BR timeout (9)
that, upon expiry, will place the message block the target queue.
.PP
Unlike
.BR mi_timer_ticks (9),
if the message block already has a running timer associated with it,
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
will not cancel the previous timeout and will return false (0).  If the message block is not
scheduled, the message block will be scheduled, as if with
.BR mi_timer_ticks (9),
and the call will return true (1).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
is used instead of
.BR mi_timer_ticks (9)
when it is desired not to restart a running timer.  See
.BR mi_timer_ticks (9)
for additional usage information.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
return true (1) if the timer message has been scheduled to be placed on the target queue,
.I ticks
ticks in the future; or false (0) if the timer is already running or a timeout is currently being
processed.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
always succeeds.  If
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
is passed a
.B NULL
or invalid message pointer, or a pointer that points to an invalid structure, the kernel may
destabilize and a kernel panic may ensue.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
For examples, see
.BR mi_timer (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
must not be called from a priority level higher than a timeout.  On
.B Linux
this means that
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
must not be called from an interrupt service routine.  To place the call at the same priority level,
schedule a tasklet to make the call.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.  When using the functions in the proscribed
fashion, the called need not guarantee exclusive access to the passed in message block or queue.
See
.BR mi_timer (9)
for more information.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
is an
.IR OpenSS7 -specific
function with
.IR MacOT \(rg
and
.IR Solaris \(rg
variants:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _SUN_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Some versions of
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
place the message block onto the target queue, bypassing the queue's put procedure.  These variants
only work for queues that have service procedures.
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation of
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
also uses
.BR putq (9)
to place the message block on the target queue, thus the queue requires a service procedure.

.SH BUGS

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
is an
.IR OpenSS7 -specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR timeout (9)
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR OpenSS7
for the purpose of porting
.IR OpenSS7
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@
.]
differ from that of
.IR OpenSS7 ,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR OpenSS7
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_timer_cond ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR os7compat (9),
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR suncompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
