.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.\"
.\"
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
provides a compatibility module,
.BR streams-uw7compat.o ,
that provides compatibility functions that smooth porting of drivers from the
.I Mac OpenTransport 1.5r2
.I STREAMS
environment to
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
The functions provided by this compatibility module are described here.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Many of the functions that are provided by
.IR UnixWare \(rg
are also provided by the core
.B streams.o
kernel module of
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
Other
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
functions are provided by the
.B streams-uw7compat.o
compatibility kernel module.

These are
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
functions:
.B _UW7_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose these symbols.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_UW7
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_UW7_MODULE
defined.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
These functions are compatible with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
These are
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
functions and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.I SVR 4.2 MP
functions should be used in their stead.
.IP \(em
These functions
are provided for source level compatibility with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR UnixWare \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
These functions
only provide functionality comparable to
.IR UnixWare \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
these functions
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
