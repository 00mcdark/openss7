.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue to which the associated private structure is to be acquired and
locked.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
DDI.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_trylock (),
.BR mi_sleeplock (9),
and
.BR mi_unlock (9)
are a set of per queue pair Stream locking functions that can be used with the
functions from the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family.
.PP
.BR mi_trylock ()
attempts to lock the private structure associated with the queue,
.IR q .
When successful, the function returns a pointer to the private stucture.  When
unsuccessful,
.B NULL
is returned.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_trylock ()
simplifies the implementation of private structure locks for fully MP-safe
.IR STREAMS (9)
modules and drivers.  The function attempts to lock the private structure
associated with the queue pair,
.IR q ,
and serializes access to the associated private structure.  While the lock is
held, access to the private structure is exclusive to the lock holder.
.PP
.BR mi_trylock ()
is called at the beginning of put or service procedure execution when the
procedure wishes exclusive access to the private structure (perhaps to alter
state variables).
.PP
When
.BR mi_trylock ()
fails, the caller should cause any message that was to be processed under the
lock to be place (back) onto message queue,
.IR q .
When the lock is released, the message queue,
.IR q ,
will be enabled after the lock has been released.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_trylock ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the locked private structure associated with
queue,
.IR q ;
when unsuccessful, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_trylock ()
fails and returns
.B NULL
when there is no private structure associated with queue,
.IR q ;
or, when it was not possible to immediately lock the structure.  The
difference can be determined by examining
.I q->q_ptr
for
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_trylock ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and
interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_trylock ()
is MP-safe, however, see
.BR TRYLOCK (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_trylock ()
must only be called for a private structure that was allocated with
.BR mi_alloc (9)
or
.BR mi_alloc_sleep (9),
or one of the other private structure allocation functions from the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family of functions.
.PP
Any queue that uses
.BR mi_trylock (9)
should have a queue service procedure.
.PP
Each successful call to
.BR mi_trylock ()
must be matched with a corresponding call to
.BR mi_unlock (9)
or processor or process deadlock may occur.
.PP
The lock acquired by
.BR mi_trylock ()
on the private structure associated with queue,
.IR q ,
is not a recursive lock.  That is, if
.BR mi_trylock ()
is called twice for the same queue,
.IR q ,
and with no intervening
.BR mi_unlock (9),
and the first call to
.BR mi_trylock ()
succeeds, the second call will fail.  This is the best behaviour for
.IR STREAMS (9)
put and service procedures which are seldomly written with reentrancy in mind.
