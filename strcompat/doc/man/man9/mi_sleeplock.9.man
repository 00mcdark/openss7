.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_trylock (),
.BR mi_sleeplock (9),
and
.BR mi_unlock (9)
are a set of per queue pair Stream locking functions that can be used with the
functions from the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family.
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
attempts to lock the private structure associated with the queue,
.IR q .
When successful, the function returns a pointer to the private structure.
When the lock cannot be immediately required, the calling process is put to sleep awaiting the
release of the lock and awoken either on a signal or upon acquiring the lock.
When unsuccessful (the process is interrupted by a signal), the function returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
simplifies the implementation of private structure locks for fully MP-SAFE
.IR STREAMS (9)
modules and drivers.  The function attempts to lock the private structure associated with queue
pair,
.IR q ,
and serializes access to the associated private structure.  While the lock is held, access to the
private structure is exclusive to the lock holder.
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
is called during a open or close routine when the routine wishes exclusive access to the private
structure (perhaps to alter state variables).
.PP
When
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
fails to acquire the lock, the caller will sleep.  When the lock is released by the current lock
holder, the sleeping process will be woken.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the locked private structure associated with queue,
.IR q ;
when unsucessful, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
fails and returns
.B NULL
when the process' sleep is interrupted by a signal.
When
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
fails and returns
.BR NULL ,
the caller has the option of simply reinvoking
.BR mi_sleeplock ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
can be called from any blockable context, including user context, and module open and close
procedures.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
is MP-safe, however, see
.BR SV_WAIT_SIG (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
must only be called for a private structure that was allocated with
.BR mi_alloc (9)
or
.BR mi_alloc_sleep (9),
or one of the other private structure allocation functions from the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family of functions.
.PP
Any queue that uses
.BR mi_sleeplock (9)
should have a queue service procedure.
.PP
Each successful call to
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
must be matched with a corresponding call to
.BR mi_unlock (9)
or processor or process deadlock may occur.
.PP
The lock acquired by
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
on the private structure associated with queue,
.IR q ,
is not a recursive lock.  That is, if
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
is called twice for the same queue,
.IR q ,
and with no intervening
.BR mi_unlock (9),
and the first call to
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
succeeds, the second call will sleep indefinitely  This is the best behaviour for
.IR STREAMS (9)
open and close procedures which are seldomly written with reentrancy in mind.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
is implemented using synchronization variable lock functions.  See
.BR SV_WAIT_SIG (9)
for more information.

.SH BUGS

has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
is an OpenSS7 Project specific implementation of an
.IR MPS \(rg-compatible
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
is provided for use with SS7 drivers and modules that need some automatic locking of queue pair
private structure for speed and efficiency.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
does not exist in any other
.IR MPS \(rg
implementation other than
.IR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR aixcompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
.BR suncompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
.BR mi_sleeplock ()
is new for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
It is largely equivalent to the
.BR ss7_trylock (9)
SS7 common function that appeared in early releases of the
.B strss7
package and is also contained in
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
