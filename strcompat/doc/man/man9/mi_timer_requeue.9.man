.I mp
a pointer to the
.BR M_PCSIG (9)
message block that was allocated with
.BR mi_timer_alloc (9).
This message block can also contain aditional user data.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR OpenSS7 -specific
DDI.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_timer_valid (9)
can only be called once for any given message that was dequeued from a
.I STREAMS
message queue.
Timer messages can always be requeued before
.BR mi_timer_valid (9)
is called; however, in some situations it would be convenient to requeue a timer message for later
processing
.I after
.BR mi_timer_valid (9)
was called.  This would result in
.BR mi_timer_valid (9)
being called twice for the same message.
.PP
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
resets the state of the timer message to a state for which
.BR mi_timer_valid (9)
can be called again on the timer.
If this results in a queuable message,
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
returns true (1), indicating that the timer message should be requeued.
If this results in a displosed message,
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
returns false (0), indicating that the timer message should neither be freed nor requeued.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
is used in circumstances where the caller desires to requeue a timer message that has already been
passed to
.BR mi_timer_valid (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
returns true (1) when the message may be requeued, and false (0) when the reference to the timer
message must simply be dropped (neither freed nor requeued).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
is always successful.  If pass
.B NULL
or invalid pointers a arguments, or pointers to invalid structure, the kernel may become
destabilized and a kernel panic may ensue.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
can be called from any context, however, it is intended to be called from within a
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure, or
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
is MP-safe.  It uses atomic exchanges to guarantee atomicity of timer state.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
is an
.IR OpenSS7 -specific
function with
.IR MacOT \(rg
and
.IR Solaris \(rg
variants:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _SUN_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
If the timer is found to be idle (its normal state immediately following a call to
.BR mi_timer_valid (9)
that returns true), it is set back to expired and the message type set to
.BR M_SIG (9).
For other state, 
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
is equivalent to a call to
.BR mi_timer_valid (9).

.SH BUGS

.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
is an
.IR OpenSS7 -specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR timeout (9)
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR OpenSS7
for the purpose of porting
.IR OpenSS7
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@
.]
differ from that of
.IR OpenSS7 ,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR OpenSS7
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR os7compat (9),
.BR mpscompat (9),

.BR maccompat (9),

.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.

.SH HISTORY

.BR mi_timer_move (9)

.IR MPS \(rg.
.BR mi_timer_move (9)
is a
Mentat, Inc. function that goes all the way back to the
.RI pre- OSF/1
.I Mentat
implementations.
.BR mi_timer_move (9)
appears in
.IR MacOT \(rg.
.[

An undocumented version of
.BR mi_timer_move (9)
appears in
.IR Solaris \(rg.
.BR mi_timer_requeue ()
is an
.I OpenSS7
embelishment to the
.BR mi_timer_move (9)
utility, that first appeared in
.BR strcompat-0.9.2.6 .
