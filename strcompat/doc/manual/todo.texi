Things to do:

@itemize @minus
@item
Work in streams_interrupt() and STREAMS_TIMEOUT() from IRIX into irixcompat.c.

@item
Hey, here's an idea for testing Solaris compatibility: take an OpenSolaris source file for a STREAMS
driver and compile and test it under Linux with no (or minimal) source code modifications!

@item
Write test programs and test suites.  There are really not any test programs or test suites
available for the OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility Modules package as of strcompat-0.9.2.2.

@item
Not all compatibility functionality is implemented.  There are a large number of Sun DDI functions
applicable to STREAMS that have not been fully implemented.  Also, the Sun configuration management
mechanism is not yet fully implemented and neither is that for AIX.  Also, there is a large group of
SVR 4.2 compatible functions that are not directly STREAMS related but are part of the DDI/DKI and
should be implemented to provide abstraction from Linux internals as well as the ability to link
binary modules.

@item
Linking of binary modules is not yet supported.  This is the place (strcompat) where binary modules
should be permitted to be loaded against either Linux STREAMS or Linux Fast-STREAMS, because the
binary compatibility interface modules are defined here.  There is the beginnings of an strconf
script output to generate a C-language wrapper file that will link with a binary object file to
generate a loadable module that could load under Linux STREAMS or Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Note that
there are a bunch of binary compatibility issues with Linux STREAMS in the first place (it cannot
even be binary compatible with user programs written for 32bit architectures running on 64bit
architectures).  For fairly restricted use modules and drivers, a single binary object could run on
both LiS and LfS.

@item
Documentation.  The documentation is trailing a bit.  I have thousands of manual pages written,
however, some are sparse or incomplete.  Also, the manual and the STREAMS Porting Guide needs a
bunch of work.
