The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility package.

 Major changes for release strcompat-0.9.2.7.20080921
-----------------------------------------------------

This is the seventh separate `OpenSS7 Project' release of the
`OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility' package.  The package was originally
present in the `Linux Fast-STREAMS' `streams-0.7a.2' release package,
but has been separated for five releases.

This release is a stable, production grade release for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS' and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(`openss7-0.9.2.G').  It deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade
before reporting bugs on previous releases.

This release is primarily a maintenance release.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Kernel module license made explicit "GPL v2".  And then changed
     back to "GPL".

   - Some minor corrections to documentation.

   - Build corrections for recent RHAS4 kernels that define
     irq_handler_t with a 3 argument function template.

   - Build corrections for XEN kernels that define paddr_t.

   - License upgrade to AGPL Version 3.

   - Fixes for older 2.4 kernels.

   - Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation
     primarily for embedded targets.

   - Improvements to common build process for embedded and
     cross-compile targets.


_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU Affero General Public
License Version 3'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball,
SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs,
see the strcompat package page
(http://www.openss7.org/strcompat_pkg.html).

 Major changes for release strcompat-0.9.2.6
--------------------------------------------

This is the sixth separate `OpenSS7 Project' release of the
`OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility' package.  The package was originally
present in the `Linux Fast-STREAMS' `streams-0.7a.2' release package,
but has been separated for five releases.

This release is a stable, production grade release for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS' and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(`openss7-0.9.2.F').  It deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade
before reporting bugs on previous releases.

This release is primarily a maintenance release.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Support build on openSUSE 10.2.

   - Support build on Fedora 7 and 2.6.21 kernel.

   - Rework of `mi_timer(9)' based timers with the addition of several
     new helper functions.  Enhancements and minor corrections to some
     OpenSS7 specific compatibility functions.

   - Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).

   - Support build on Ubuntu 7.04.

   - Updated to gettext 0.16.1.

     2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 kernel.

   - Supports build on Fedora Core 6.

   - Support for recent distributions and tool chains.


 Major changes for release strcompat-0.9.2.5
--------------------------------------------

This is the fifth separate `OpenSS7 Project' release of the
`OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility' package.  The package was originally
present in the `Linux Fast-STREAMS' `streams-0.7a.2' release package,
but has been separated for five releases.

This release is a stable, production grade release for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS' and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(`openss7-0.9.2.E').  It deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade
before reporting bugs on previous releases.

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  Some functionality of
the package has been tested by its use in other packages and some
defects corrected.  Support for `LiS' was deprecated as of the previous
release.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Added versions to all exported symbols.  Made OpenSS7 unique
     functions GPL export.

   - Improvements to the common build environment with better support
     for standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

   - Fixed bug found from inspection in `mi_copyout(9)' function.

   - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.

   - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number
     as unpacked by separate tarball.


 Major changes for release strcompat-0.9.2.4
--------------------------------------------

This is the fourth separate `OpenSS7 Project' release of the
`OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility' package.  The package was originally
present in the `Linux Fast-STREAMS' `streams-0.7a.2' release package,
but has been separated for four releases.

This release is a stable, production grade release for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS' and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(`openss7-0.9.2.G').  It deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade
before reporting bugs on previous releases.

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  Some functionality of
the package has been tested by its use in other packages and some
defects corrected.  Support for `LiS' is deprecated as of this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patch set).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versions to all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.

   - Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including
     debian script corrections.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

 Major changes for release strcompat-0.9.2.3
--------------------------------------------

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

   - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs
     on x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc
     4.0.2 compiler warnings.

   - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

   - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
     mailing list.

   - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs
     on x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc
     4.0.2 compiler warnings.

   - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
     Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
     N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

   - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
     x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

This is a public beta test release of the package.

 Major changes for release strcompat-0.9.2.2
--------------------------------------------

This is primarily a bug fixes release and corrections resulting from
testing.  This is a major bug fix release.  The previous release was
largely untested.  This release has been verified (conformance test
suite passes) for operation with `Linux Fast-STREAMS'
(`streams-0.7a.4').

 Initial release strcompat-0.9.2.1
----------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strcompat' release.

This is the initial release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility'
package for `Linux Fast-STREAMS' (and LiS).  These compatibility modules
were formerly part of the `Linux Fast-STREAMS' package
(`streams-0.7a.3'), however, as they were also applicable to `LiS',
they have been removed into a separate package.  Once `Linux
Fast-STREAMS' is production grade, these compatibility modules will be
rolled back into the streams package as `LiS' becomes deprecated.
