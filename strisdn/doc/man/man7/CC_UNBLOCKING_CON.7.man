.SH NAME
.B CC_UNBLOCKING_CON
\- circuit unblocking confirmation
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_unblocking_con {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_UNBLOCKING_CON */
    ulong cc_flags;             /* unblocking flags */
    ulong cc_addr_length;       /* address length */
    ulong cc_addr_offset;       /* address offset */
} CC_unblocking_con_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive confirms a previous unblocking request (or indicates failure of
a previous unblocking request).
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_UNBLOCKING_CON .
.TP
.I cc_flags
Specifies the options flags and result of the operation. (See
.IR \*(lqFlags\*(rq ,
below.)
.TP
.I cc_addr_length
Specifies the length of the call control address (signalling interface and
circuit or circuit group identifiers) for which local unblocking is confirmed.
.TP
.I cc_addr_offset
Specifies the offset of the call controll adress(es) from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.\"
.\"
.\" .SS Rules
.\"
.\"
.SS Flags
The options flags are protocol and provider-specific.  For additional
information, see the specific Addendum.
.\"
.\"
.SS State
This primitive will only be issued by the CCS provider if the local unblocking
state of the specified address(es) is
.BR CCS_WCON_UBREQ .
The new local unblocking state will be
.B CCS_UNBLOCKED
for the specified call control addresses.
.\"
.\"
.SS Modes
This primitive will only be issued by the CCS provider for signalling
interfaces in the NNI mode.
.\"
.\"
.SS Originator
This primitive is issued by the CC Provider.
