.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of the mssage is one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block, and its structure is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_error_ack {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_ERROR_ACK */
    ulong cc_error_primitive;   /* primitive in error */
    ulong cc_error_type;        /* CCI error code */
    ulong cc_unix_error;        /* UNIX system error code */
    ulong cc_state;             /* current state */
    ulong cc_call_ref;          /* call reference */
} CC_error_ack_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the CCS user that a non-fatal error has occurred
in the last CCS user originated primitive.  This may only be initiated as an
acknowledgment for those primitives that require one.  It also indicates to
the user that no action was taken on the primitive that caused the error.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_ERROR_ACK .
.TP
.I cc_error_primitive
Identifies the primitive type that cause the error.
.TP
.I cc_error_type
Contains the Call Control Interface error code.
.TP
.I cc_unix_error
Contains the UNIX system error code.  This may only be non-zero if the
.I cc_error_type
is equal to
.RB [ CCSYSERR ].
.TP
.I cc_state
Identifies the state of the interface at the time that the
.B CC_ERROR_ACK
primitive was issued by the CCS provider.
.TP
.I cc_call_ref
Identifies the CCS provider or CCS user call reference associated with the
request or response primitive that was in error.  If no call reference is
associated with the request or response primitive that caused the error, this
field is coded zero (0) by the CCS provider.
.\"
.\"
.\".SS Rules
.\"
.\"
.SS State
This primitive is valid in all states that have a pending acknowledgment or
confirmation.  The new state is the same as the one from which the
acknowledged request or response was issued.
.\"
.\"
.SS Modes
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.\"
.SS Originator
This primitive is issued by the CC Provider.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
The following error codes are allows to be returned:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.RB [ CCSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the UNIX system error is indicated in the
primitive.
.TP
.RB [ CCOUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADADDR ]
The call control address as specified in the primitive was in an incorrect
format, or the address contained illegal information.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADDIGS ]
The digits provided in the called party number or subsequent number specified
in the primitive are of an incorrect format or are invalid.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADOPT ]
The options values as specified in the primitive were in an incorrect format,
or they contained illegal information.
.TP
.RB [ CCNOADDR ]
The CCS provider could not allocate an address.
.TP
.RB [ CCADDRBUSY ]
The CCS provider could not use the specified address because the specified
address is already in use.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADCLR ]
The call reference specified in the primitive was incorrect or illegal.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADTOK ]
Token used is not associated with an open stream.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADFLAG ]
The flags specified in the primitive were incorrect or illegal.
.TP
.RB [ CCNOTSUPP ]
Specified primitive type is not known to the CCS provider.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADPRIM ]
The primitive was of an incorrect format (i.e. too small, or an offset is out
of range).
.TP
.RB [ CCACCESS ]
The user did not have proper permissions.
