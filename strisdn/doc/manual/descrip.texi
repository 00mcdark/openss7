@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} (@value{PACKAGE}) is an @cite{OpenSS7 Project} implementation of a
number of ISDN related components, including Q.920, Q.921, Q.931, GR-303, V5.2, DPNSS/DASS.  The
package includes kernel modules, @cite{SVR 4.2} @dfn{STREAMS} drivers, modules, libraries,
utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the development and execution of
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} applications for the @cite{SVR 4.2} @dfn{STREAMS} environment.

This release is the first separate release of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package.  Some of the
components in this package were formerly present in the @file{strss7} package.  Various networking
drivers are provided as well as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and CCI header files for ISDN operation.  The
package contains the necessary manual pages and other documentation for ISDN components in a
separate autoconf tarball.

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package includes kernel modules, @cite{SVR 4.2} @dfn{STREAMS}
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the
development and execution of @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} applications for the @cite{SVR 4.2}
@dfn{STREAMS} environment.

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a reference point for the community.
If you are interested in completion of this package, sponsor the OpenSS7 Project.  To sponsor the
project, contact @email{info@@openss7.com}.

This distribution is only currently applicable to @cite{Linux} 2.4 and 2.6 kernels and was targeted
at @code{ix86}, @code{x86_64}, @code{ppc} and @code{ppc64} architectures, but should build and
install for other architectures as well.
