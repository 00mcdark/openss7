This is the second open source release of the <cite>OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN</cite> package.  This
release contains modules and drivers formerly only available with Commercial releases of the
<tt>strss7</tt> package and which are only recently available as open source with the release of
this package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
With OpenSS7 Master Package release <tt>openss7-0.9.2.D</tt>, the ISDN components were separated
from the <tt>strss7</tt> package and placed in this package.  Not all of the ISDN components
previously part of the <tt>strss7</tt> package have been strapped into this release.  Components
will be re-validated against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module and driver-by-driver basis.
See TODO in the release, or <em>Schedule,</em> in the manual, for information about the release
schedule.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The major component first available is LAPD.  lapd(4) is a pushable STREAMS module that is pushed
over a cdi(4) HDLC channel to form an ISDN Q.931 link providing the Data Link Provider Interface
(dlpi(7)).  A complete test suite will be available in a further release.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full ISDN Q.931, Q.933, GR-303 and V5.2
drivers with conformance test suites.

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a reference point for the community.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Improvements to the common build environment with better support for standalone package builds
on 2.4 kernels.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.<bdo/></li>
<li>The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as unpacked by separate
tarball.<bdo/></li>
</ul><p style="margin-bottom:0in">

components, including Q.920, Q.921, Q.931, GR-303, V5.2, DPNSS/DASS.  The package includes kernel
modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and

the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is the second separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN package.  Some of the
components in this package were formerly present in the <tt>strss7</tt> package.  Various networking
