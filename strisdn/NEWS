The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN package.

 Initial release strisdn-0.9.2.2
--------------------------------

This is the second open source release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the ISDN
components were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the ISDN components previously part of the
`strss7' package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the release, or `Schedule', in
the manual, for information about the release schedule.

This is a maintenance release providing support for additional
distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Support for autoconf 2.61 and gettext 0.16.

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.

   - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number
     as unpacked by separate tarball.


 Initial release strisdn-0.9.2.1
--------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strisdn' release.

This is the initial open source release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the ISDN
components were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the ISDN components previously part of the
`strss7' package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the release, or `Schedule', in
the manual, for information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is LAPD.  `lapd(4)'
is a pushable "STREAMS" module that is pushed over a `cdi(4)' HDLC
channel to form an ISDN Q.931 link providing the Data Link Provider
Interface (`dlpi(7)').  A complete test suite will be available in a
further release.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full ISDN
Q.931, Q.933, GR-303 and V5.2 drivers with conformance test suites.

_This is the initial public alpha release of the package.  Please see
`README-alpha' in the release or `Maturity', in the manual._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs,
see the strisdn package page (http://www.openss7.org/strisdn_pkg.html).
