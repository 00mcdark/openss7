strisdn-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN (strisdn) is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of a
number of ISDN related components, including Q.920, Q.921, Q.931,
GR-303, V5.2, DPNSS/DASS.  The package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS ISDN applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This release is the first separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN
package.  Some of the components in this package were formerly present
in the `strss7' package.  Various networking drivers are provided as
well as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and CCI header files for ISDN operation.
The package contains the necessary manual pages and other documentation
for ISDN components in a separate autoconf tarball.

This is the initial alpha release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is part of
the OpenSS7 Master Package (as of openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is the initial public release.

 This is the initial public alpha release of the package.
 
 Please see `README-alpha' in the release or
 <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strisdn-0.9.2.1/README-alpha>.

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, contact <info@openss7.com>.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strisdn package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strisdn_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strisdn-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strisdn-0.9.2.1/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strisdn.pdf manual in the release
