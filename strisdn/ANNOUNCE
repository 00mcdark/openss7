Package strisdn-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN (strisdn) is an OpenSS7 Project implementation of a
number of ISDN related components, including Q.920, Q.921, Q.931,
GR-303, V5.2, DPNSS/DASS.  The package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS ISDN applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This release is the first separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN
package.  Some of the components in this package were formerly present
in the `strss7' package.  Various networking drivers are provided as
well as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and CCI header files for ISDN operation.
The package contains the necessary manual pages and other documentation
for ISDN components in a separate autoconf tarball.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS ISDN applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, sponsor the OpenSS7 Project.  To sponsor the project,
contact <info@openss7.com>.

This is the initial open source release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which are
only recently available as open source with the release of this package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release openss7-0.9.2.D, the ISDN components
were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this package.
Not all of the ISDN components previously part of the `strss7' package
have been strapped into this release.  Components will be re-validated
against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module and driver-by-driver
basis.  See TODO in the release, or `Schedule', in the manual, for
information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is LAPD.
lapd(4) is a pushable STREAMS module that is pushed over a cdi(4) HDLC
channel to form an ISDN Q.931 link providing the Data Link Provider
Interface (dlpi(7)).  A complete test suite will be available in a
further release.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full ISDN
Q.931, Q.933, GR-303 and V5.2 drivers with conformance test suites.

_This is the initial public alpha release of the package.  Please see
README-alpha in the release or `Maturity', in the manual._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strisdn package page (http://www.openss7.org/strisdn_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strisdn-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strisdn-0.9.2.1/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `strisdn.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/strisdn_manual.html).

release providing support for additional distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

 - Improvements to the common build environment with better support for
   standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

 - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

 - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.

 - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as
   unpacked by separate tarball.

This is a public alpha release of the package.  Please see README-alpha
in the release.
