Package strsock-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Sockets package provides STREAMS modules and
drivers, libraries, programs, initialization scripts, and daemons.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Sockets package contains header files and a number
of modules and drivers and the associated documentation originally
contained in the Linux Fast-STREAMS release, but not contained in the
Linux STREAMS (LiS) releases.

The package uses the following standard Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)
conforming header files from the `strxnet' package:

     - <sys/tiuser.h> Transport Provider Interface (TPI)
     - <sys/tihdr.h> Transport Provider Interface (TPI)

The package currently provides the following STREAMS modules and
drivers:

     - streams_sockmod.ko               module
     - streams_socksys.ko               /dev/socksys

   * sockmod(4) The sockmod(4) module, when pushed on a TPI
     Stream, attempts to provide as wide a range of support for
     traditional SVR 4.2 socket module and socket system support.

     It does so by recognizing input-output controls from three sets:
     sockmod(4) input-output controls; socksys(4) input-output controls,
     and even socket(7) system calls.

   * socksys(4) The socksys(4) driver, when opened, provides a
     TPI Stream that attempts to provide as wide a range of support for
     traditional SVR 4.2 socket module and socket system support.

     It does so by recognizing input-output controls from three sets:
     sockmod(4) input-output controls; socksys(4) input-output controls,
     and even socket(7) system calls.

The package currently provides the following STREAMS libraries:

     - libsocket.so libsocket.a
     - libsocklib.so libsocklib.a

The libsocket library implements the following library calls:

     socket(3)                                     

The `libsocket' library only needs to implement the single library call
because file descriptors that are returned from the socket(3) call have
been transformed into real sockets (from the viewpoint of the system
call interface) and standard `glibc' calls for the remaining functions
are used.

The `libsocklib' library implements the following library calls:

     accept(3)             listen(3)             sendto(3)
     bind(3)               recv(3)               setsockopt(3)
     connect(3)            recvfrom(3)           shutdown(3)
     getpeername(3)        recvmsg(3)            socket(3)
     getsockname(3)        send(3)               socketpair(3)
     getsockopt(3)         sendmsg(3)            

The `libsocklib' library is the older compatiblity library approach to
providing sockets for STREAMS and implements the system calls as library
calls for STREAMS devices, while calling the `glibc' versions for true
sockets.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Sockets package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS Sockets modules and drivers.

This OpenSS7 Project release is the first separate release of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Sockets package whose components were formerly part of
the `strss7', `strxnet' and `streams' packages.  These networking
modules provide the Sockets library.  The package contains all the
necessary manual pages and other doumentation.  The package is packaged
as an OpenSS7 style autoconf tarball.

This is the initial alpha release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is part of
the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is the initial public release.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

_This is a public alpha release of the package.  Please see README-alpha
in the release or `Maturity', in the manual._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strsock package page (http://www.openss7.org/strsock_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsock-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsock-0.9.2.1/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `strsock.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/strsock_manual.html).
