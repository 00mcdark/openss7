Things to do:

   - Testing.  This package is completely untested.

   - Create a `socksys(4)' `Socket System' "STREAMS" driver.

   - It would be interesting to perform some `Netperf' and `Iperf'
     performance tests against "STREAMS"-based network drivers
     supporting `Transport Provider Interface (TPI)' and "Sockets"
     using this socket system.  Without `sockmod(4)' and `libsocket' it
     was only possible to use `Netperf' for performance testing, and
     then only using the XTI tests.

   - Create the `socket(3)' `libsocket' shared library.

   - Create a `sockmod(4)' `Socket Module' "STREAMS" module.

   - Move already written code from the `stacks' or `strss7' directories
     into the `src' directory.

   - Create a skeleton directory and manual and place `strsock' as a
     subpackage in the `OpenSS7 Master Package'.

     _*done*_

     You are reading it.

The `strsock' package is currently incomplete.

The purpose of the package was to move "STREAMS" socket capabilities
outside of the "STREAMS" release package so as to allow them to be used
with both `LiS' and `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.  As `Linux Fast-STREAMS' has
already shown superior to `LiS' in terms of both performance and
conformance, it is no longer necessary to keep these packages separate
and they can be combined once again (or still) with `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.
