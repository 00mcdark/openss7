 Major changes for release strsock-0.9.2.1
------------------------------------------

This `OpenSS7 Project' release is the first separate release of the
`OpenSS7 STREAMS Sockets' package whose components were formerly part
of the `strss7', `strxnet' and `streams' packages.  These networking
modules provide the Sockets library.  The package contains all the
necessary manual pages and other doumentation.  The package is packaged
as an OpenSS7 style autoconf tarball.

This is the initial alpha release for `Linux Fast-STREAMS' and is part
of the OpenSS7 Master Package (`openss7-0.9.2.D').

This release is the initial public release.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

_This is a public alpha release of the package.  Please see
`README-alpha' in the release or `Maturity', in the manual._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM-based or dpkg-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs or DEBs.  See the download page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  See the strsock package page
(http://www.openss7.org/strsock_pkg.html) for tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and
binary RPMs or DEBs.

See `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strsock-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog' and

for more information.  Also, see the `strsock.pdf' manual in the
