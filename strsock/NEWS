modules provide the Sockets library.  The package contains all the
necessary manual pages and other documentation.  The package is
packaged as an OpenSS7 style autoconf tarball.

installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU Affero General Public
