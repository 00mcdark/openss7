This is the fourth OpenSS7 Project release of the NETPERF Utility package.  This release is a stable,
production grade release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(openss7-0.9.2.D).
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is primarily a maintenance release that provides support for more distributions and
architectures as well as tracking feature updates on related packages.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Updates to permit use with strinet-0.9.2.4 second generation UDP driver, strsctp-0.9.2.6 STREAMS
SCTP driver, sctp-0.2.24 Sockets SCTP driver.</li>
<li>Includes workup of benchmark scripts for SCTP, TCP and UDP.  Added a scls_show option to perform
scls -c (see scls(1)) to show STREAMS module and driver statistics between test sample points when
verbosity is set to 2 and XTI is being used.  This assists with performance testing as it shows the
counts accumulated to put and service routine throughout the Stream.  It was used in UDP2 testing of
the strinet package and will come in handy for the SCTP testing.</li>
<li>Includes results of performance testing of the new second generation UDP driver (implemented
completely in STREAMS instead of using an internal socket).</li>
<li>Additional features supported in all packages (see master package release notes).</li>
<!--
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new - -with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added - -disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 2.3.4 of the OpenSS7-modified <em>netperf</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
Netperf is a general purpose tool for benchmarking bandwidth and performance
of the Internet Protocol suite.  The OpenSS7 Modified OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package is an OpenSS7
Project (http://www.openss7.org/) release of the of the Hewlett-Packard netperf package configured
to run with OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) and the OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS,
XTI/TLI and INET packages.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package provide primarily the netperf(1) and netserver(8), C Language
programs that act as Netperf client or server for testing connections and networking.  The
netserver(8) program is executed on one host acting as a server, and then netperf(1) is executed on
another host acting in client mode.  Characteristics of the connection or association can be altered
when formed.  Reporting formats and sample intervals can also be altered when the connection or
association is formed.  Users executing netperf(1) do not need to have shell access to the
netserver(8) host.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This is a fork of the Netperf package released by Hewlett-Packard modified by the OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org/) for use with OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI, INET and SCTP packages.  This
OpenSS7 release of the package is based on the Netperf-2.3 release from Hewlett-Packard.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Modifications to the package are derived from the OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI, INET and SCTP
implementations and are release under the `GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2'.  The Netperf
tool itself is licensed under specific terms by Hewlett-Packard.  Please see file LICENSES for the
Hewlett-Packard Netperf copyright notices and licensing restrictions.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
