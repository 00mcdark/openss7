@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

Added @samp{--enable-devel} @command{configure} option for embedded targets.
Added @command{send-pr} script for automatic problem report generation.

@node Release netperf-2.3.3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release netperf-2.3.3
@cindex release netperf-2.3.3

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2), architectures (x86_64, SMP,
32-bit compatibility), recent Linux distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels
(2.6.15).

Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on x86_64 architecture.  Some bug
corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler warnings.

@node Release netperf-2.3.2
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release netperf-2.3.2
@cindex release netperf-2.3.2

Many corrections (but not enough) are included to use the package for XTI INET testing.  UDP works
now, but TCP is not completely corrected yet (and, therefore, neither is SCTP).  These capabilities
could not have possibly worked in the original @cite{netperf-2.3} release.  The next release should
have TCP and SCTP corrected for XTI.

Corrections included to make the package cross-build for @cite{Nex@-us@-Ware} as well as recent
2.6.14 (FC4) kernels.

What remains to be done is to merge in the latest upstream release of netperf into this package and
contribute XTI corrections back upstream.

@node Release netperf-2.3.1
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release netperf-2.3.1
@cindex release netperf-2.3.1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the @command{@value{PACKAGE}} release.  It is based on the
Hewlett-Packard Company @cite{netperf-2.3} release.

This release provides modifications to support the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and
provides tests for the Sockets API for the OpenSS7 Linux Native Kernel version of SCTP as well as
tests for the XTI API for the OpenSS7 STREAMS version of SCTP.  In addition, use of the XTI API for
TCP and UDP tests is supported using the OpenSS7 STREAMS INET package.

SCTP Sockets API tests depend upon the availability of an the OpenSS7 Sockets implementation of SCTP
in an OpenSS7 patched kernel.  Some binary kernels and prepatched kernel source for popular
architectures are provided as RPMs from @uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, the OpenSS7
Project download page}.

SCTP XTI API tests depend upon the availability of the OpenSS7 STREAMS implementation of SCTP.  Some
binary and source packages for @cite{LiS STREAMS}, @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}, the @cite{strxnet}
XTI/TLI library and the @cite{strsctp} package are available from
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, the OpenSS7 Project download page}.  @ref{Top,
Introduction, Introduction, libxnet, The OpenSS7 XNS/XTI Library Reference Manual}.

Under Linux, the TCP and UDP XTI API tests depend upon the availability of the OpenSS7 INET driver.
Some binary and source packages for @cite{LiS STREAMS}, @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}, the
@cite{strxnet} XTI/TLI library and the @cite{strinet} package (@pxref{Top, Introduction,
Introduction, strinet, OpenSS7 STREAMS INET Driver}) are available from
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, the OpenSS7 Project download page}.  @ref{Top,
Introduction, Introduction, libxnet, The OpenSS7 XNS/XTI Library Reference Manual}.

This release also provides updates to the antiquated @cite{netperf-2.1} release documentation
distributed with @cite{netperf-2.3}.
