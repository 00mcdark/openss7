@emph{This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before
reporting bugs.}

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and
builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the @cite{GNU General Public License
Version 2} as well as the HP license (see @file{LICENSE} in the distribution for
more information.) The release is available as an @command{autoconf} tarball,
SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html,downloads page} for the
@command{autoconf} tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-2.3.4
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-2.3.4
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-2.3.4

This is the fourth full release of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package.

This release is largely a maintenance release that provides support for more
distributions an architectures as well as tracking feature updates on related
packages:

@itemize -
@item
Updates to permit use with @command{strinet-@value{VERSION_STRINET}} second
generation @dfn{UDP} driver, @command{strsctp-@value{VERSION_STRSCTP}}
@dfn{STREAMS} SCTP driver, @command{sctp-@value{VERSION_SCTP}} @dfn{Sockets}
SCTP driver.

@item
Added @command{send-pr} scripts for automatic problem report generation.
(Please do not report bugs on LiS.)

@item
Added @command{--disable-devel} @command{configure} option to suppress
building and installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
or pure runtime targets that do not need the development environment (static
libraries, manual pages, documentation).

@item
Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent @command{gcc}
compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily
SUSE).  Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in
addition to kernel programs.  Added new @option{--with-optimize} option to
@command{configure} to accomplish this.

@item
Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
distributions: support for additional @cite{SuSE} distributions on @code{ix86}
as well as @code{x86_64}.  Added distribution support includes @cite{SLES 9},
@cite{SLES 9 SP2}, @cite{SLES 9 SP3}, @cite{SLES 10}, @cite{SuSE 10.1}.

@item
Many documentation updates for all @uref{http://www.openss7.org/,, OpenSS7}
packages.  Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
timely text documentation present in the release directory.

@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.  The @samp{make installcheck} target will now automatically
test both 64-bit native and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other,
on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Includes results of performance testing of the new second generation UDP
driver (implemented completely in STREAMS instead of using an internal
socket).

@item
Includes workup of benchmark scripts for SCTP, TCP and UDP.  Added a scls_show
option to perform @samp{scls -c} (see @manref{scls(1)}) to show @dfn{STREAMS}
module and driver statistics between test sample points when verbosity is set
to 2 and XTI is being used.  This assists with performance testing as it shows
the counts accumulated to put and service routine throughout the
@dfn{Stream}.  It was used in @dfn{UDP2} testing of the @command{strinet}
package and will come in handy for the @dfn{SCTP} testing.

@node Release netperf-2.3.3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release netperf-2.3.3
@cindex release netperf-2.3.3

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux distributions
(EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on x86_64
architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler
warnings.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release netperf-2.3.2
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release netperf-2.3.2
@cindex release netperf-2.3.2

Many corrections (but not enough) are included to use the package for XTI INET
testing.  UDP works now, but TCP is not completely corrected yet (and,
therefore, neither is SCTP).  These capabilities could not have possibly
worked in the original @cite{netperf-2.3} release.  The next release should
have TCP and SCTP corrected for XTI.

Corrections included to make the package cross-build for @cite{Nex@-us@-Ware}
as well as recent 2.6.14 (FC4) kernels.

What remains to be done is to merge in the latest upstream release of netperf
into this package and contribute XTI corrections back upstream.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release netperf-2.3.1
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release netperf-2.3.1
@cindex release netperf-2.3.1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the @command{@value{PACKAGE}} release.  It
is based on the @uref{http://www.hp.com/,, Hewlett-Packard Company}
@cite{netperf-2.3} release.

This release provides modifications to support the Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (SCTP) and provides tests for the Sockets API for the OpenSS7 Linux
Native Kernel version of SCTP as well as tests for the XTI API for the OpenSS7
STREAMS version of SCTP.  In addition, use of the XTI API for TCP and UDP
tests is supported using the OpenSS7 STREAMS INET package.

SCTP Sockets API tests depend upon the availability of an the OpenSS7 Sockets
implementation of SCTP in an OpenSS7 patched kernel.  Some binary kernels and
prepatched kernel source for popular architectures are provided as RPMs from
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, the OpenSS7 Project download
page}.

SCTP XTI API tests depend upon the availability of the OpenSS7 STREAMS
implementation of SCTP.  Some binary and source packages for @cite{LiS
STREAMS}, @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}, the @cite{strxnet} XTI/TLI library and
the @cite{strsctp} package are available from
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, the OpenSS7 Project download
page}.  @ref{Top, Introduction, Introduction, libxnet, The OpenSS7 XNS/XTI
Library Reference Manual}.

Under Linux, the TCP and UDP XTI API tests depend upon the availability of the
OpenSS7 INET driver.  Some binary and source packages for @cite{LiS STREAMS},
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}, the @cite{strxnet} XTI/TLI library and the
@cite{strinet} package (@pxref{Top, Introduction, Introduction, strinet,
OpenSS7 STREAMS INET Driver}) are available from
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, the OpenSS7 Project download
page}.  @ref{Top, Introduction, Introduction, libxnet, The OpenSS7 XNS/XTI
Library Reference Manual}.

This release also provides updates to the antiquated @cite{netperf-2.1}
release documentation distributed with @cite{netperf-2.3}.
