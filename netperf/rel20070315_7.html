OpenSS7 today announced Release 2.3.5 of the OpenSS7-modified <em>netperf</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
Netperf is a general purpose tool for benchmarking bandwidth and performance of the Internet
Protocol suite.  The OpenSS7 Modified OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package is an
<a href="http://www.openss7.org/">OpenSS7 Project</a> release of the of the Hewlett-Packard netperf
package configured to run with OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) and the
OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI and INET packages.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package provide primarily the
<a href="http://www.openss7.org/man2html?netperf(1)">netperf(1)</a> and
<a href="http://www.openss7.org/man2html?netserver(8)">netserver(8),</a> C Language programs that
act as Netperf client or server for testing connections and networking.  The
<a href="http://www.openss7.org/man2html?netserver(8)">netserver(8)</a> program is executed on one
host acting as a server, and then
<a href="http://www.openss7.org/man2html?netperf(1)">netperf(1)</a> is executed on another host
acting in client mode.  Characteristics of the connection or association can be altered when formed.
Reporting formats and sample intervals can also be altered when the connection or association is
formed.  Users executing
<a href="http://www.openss7.org/man2html?netperf(1)">netperf(1)</a>
do not need to have shell access to the
<a href="http://www.openss7.org/man2html?netserver(8)">netserver(8)</a> host.

This is a fork of the Netperf package released by Hewlett-Packard modified by the OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org/) for use with OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI, INET and SCTP packages.  This
OpenSS7 release of the package is based on the Netperf-2.3 release from Hewlett-Packard.
