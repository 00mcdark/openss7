netperf-2.3.3 was released under GPLv2 and HP license on March 15, 2006.

This release contains the Hewlett-Packard 'netperf' package, modified to
work with the OpenSS7 Linux Native (Sockets) and STREAMS implementations
of SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol - RFC 2960) and INET.
This package contains all the necessary manual pages and files, and
configures and installs against almost any 2.4 or 2.6 kernel, even
production kernels.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's third release of the 'netperf' package
modified for OpenSS7 SCTP and INET.  This is the package that was used
to execute the performance tests shown here
<http://www.openss7.org/sctp_perf.html>.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).
It includes:

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 This is public gamma release of the package: it deprecates previous
 relesases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
 releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2' and
HP license (see the 'LICENSE' release file for more information).  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the netperf package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/netperf_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/netperf-2.3.3/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/netperf-2.3.3/NEWS> in the release for
more information.  Also, see the netperf.pdf manual in the release (also
in html <http://www.openss7.org/netperf_manual.html>).

netperf-2.3.4 was released under GPLv2 and HP license on January 8, 2007.

Netperf is a general purpose tool for benchmarking bandwidth and
performance of the Internet Protocol suite.  The OpenSS7 Modified
OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package is an OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org/) release of the of the Hewlett-Packard netperf
package configured to run with OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP (Stream Control
Transmission Protocol) and the OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI and INET
packages.

The OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package provide primarily the netperf(1) and
netserver(8), C Language programs that act as Netperf client or server
for testing connections and networking.  The netserver(8) program is
executed on one host acting as a server, and then netperf(1) is executed
on another host acting in client mode.  Characteristics of the
connection or association can be altered when formed.  Reporting formats
and sample intervals can also be altered when the connection or
association is formed.  Users executing netperf(1) do not need to have
shell access to the netserver(8) host.

This is a fork of the Netperf package released by Hewlett-Packard
modified by the OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/) for use with
OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI, INET and SCTP packages.  This OpenSS7
release of the package is based on the Netperf-2.3 release from
Hewlett-Packard.

Modifications to the package are derived from the OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS,
XTI/TLI, INET and SCTP implementations and are release under the `GNU
General Public License (GPL) Version 2'.  The Netperf tool itself is
licensed under specific terms by Hewlett-Packard.  Please see file
LICENSES for the Hewlett-Packard Netperf copyright notices and licensing
restrictions.

This is the fourth full release of the OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package.

This release is largely a maintenance release that provides support for
more distributions an architectures as well as tracking feature updates
on related packages:

   - Updates to permit use with strinet-0.9.2.4 second generation UDP
     driver, strsctp-0.9.2.6 STREAMS SCTP driver, sctp-0.2.24 Sockets
     SCTP driver.

   - Added send-pr scripts for automatic problem report generation.
     (Please do not report bugs on LiS.)

   - Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).  Optimized compilation is now available also for
     user level programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     --with-optimize option to configure to accomplish this.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The make installcheck target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Includes results of performance testing of the new second
     generation UDP driver (implemented completely in STREAMS instead of
     using an internal socket).

   - Includes workup of benchmark scripts for SCTP, TCP and UDP.  Added
     a scls_show option to perform scls -c (see scls(1)) to show STREAMS
     module and driver statistics between test sample points when
     verbosity is set to 2 and XTI is being used.  This assists with
     performance testing as it shows the counts accumulated to put and
     service routine throughout the Stream.  It was used in UDP2 testing
     of the strinet package and will come in handy for the SCTP testing.

 This is public production release of the package: it deprecates
 previous releases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with
 previous releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2' and HP
license (see the 'LICENSE' release file for more information).  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the netperf package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/netperf_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.
