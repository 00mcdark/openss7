netperf-2.3.3 was released under GPLv2 and HP license on March 15, 2006.

This release contains the Hewlett-Packard 'netperf' package, modified to
work with the OpenSS7 Linux Native (Sockets) and STREAMS implementations
of SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol - RFC 2960) and INET.
This package contains all the necessary manual pages and files, and
configures and installs against almost any 2.4 or 2.6 kernel, even
production kernels.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's third release of the 'netperf' package
modified for OpenSS7 SCTP and INET.  This is the package that was used
to execute the performance tests shown here
<http://www.openss7.org/sctp_perf.html>.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).
It includes:

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 This is public gamma release of the package: it deprecates previous
 relesases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
 releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2' and
HP license (see the 'LICENSE' release file for more information).  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the netperf package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/netperf_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/netperf-2.3.3/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/netperf-2.3.3/NEWS> in the release for
more information.  Also, see the netperf.pdf manual in the release (also
in html <http://www.openss7.org/netperf_manual.html>).
