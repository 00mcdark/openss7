Package netperf-2.3.4 was released 2007-01-08.

Netperf is a general purpose tool for benchmarking bandwidth and
performance of the Internet Protocol suite.  The OpenSS7 Modified
OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package is an OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org/) release of the of the Hewlett-Packard
`netperf' package configured to run with OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP (Stream
Control Transmission Protocol) and the OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI and
INET packages.

The OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package provide primarily the netperf(1) and
netserver(8), C Language programs that act as Netperf client or server
for testing connections and networking.  The netserver(8) program is
executed on one host acting as a server, and then netperf(1) is executed
on another host acting in client mode.  Characteristics of the
connection or association can be altered when formed.  Reporting formats
and sample intervals can also be altered when the connection or
association is formed.  Users executing netperf(1) do not need to have
shell access to the netserver(8) host.

This is a fork of the Netperf package released by Hewlett-Packard
modified by the OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/) for use with
OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI, INET and SCTP packages.  This OpenSS7
release of the package is based on the Netperf-2.3 release from
Hewlett-Packard.

Modifications to the package are derived from the OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS,
XTI/TLI, INET and SCTP implementations and are release under the `GNU
General Public License (GPL) Version 2'.  The Netperf tool itself is
licensed under specific terms by Hewlett-Packard.  Please see file
LICENSES for the Hewlett-Packard Netperf copyright notices and licensing
restrictions.

This is the fourth full release of the OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package.

This release is largely a maintenance release that provides support for
more distributions an architectures as well as tracking feature updates
on related packages:

   - Updates to permit use with strinet-0.9.2.4 second generation UDP
     driver, strsctp-0.9.2.6 STREAMS SCTP driver, sctp-0.2.24 Sockets
     SCTP driver.

   - Added `send-pr' scripts for automatic problem report generation.
     (Please do not report bugs on LiS.)

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).  Optimized compilation is now available also for
     user level programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Includes results of performance testing of the new second
     generation UDP driver (implemented completely in STREAMS instead of
     using an internal socket).

   - Includes workup of benchmark scripts for SCTP, TCP and UDP.  Added
     a scls_show option to perform `scls -c' (see scls(1)) to show
     STREAMS module and driver statistics between test sample points
     when verbosity is set to 2 and XTI is being used.  This assists
     with performance testing as it shows the counts accumulated to put
     and service routine throughout the Stream.  It was used in UDP2
     testing of the `strinet' package and will come in handy for the
     SCTP testing.

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2' as well as the HP license (see LICENSE in the distribution
ofro more information.)  The release is available as an autoconf
tarball, SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads
page (http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see
the netperf package page (http://www.openss7.org/netperf_pkg.html).

This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases. Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.
