Things to do:

- Merge in upstream changes into the OpenSS7 Modified version.

- Get the OpenSS7 Modified version working also with Linux Native
  Sockets SCTP in addition to the current STREAMS SCTP XTI support.
  This would not only allow Netperf to be used successfully with OpenSS7
  Linux Native SCTP, but it would also comparison tests between STREAMS
  an Sockets versions.  This is something that I would really like to
  do.  Since Linux Fast-STREAMS STREAMS-based pipes beat FC4 Native
  pipes on 2.6.14 in a performance test, it would be interesting to see
  whether the STREAMS version can outpace the Sockets version.  This
  would be an answer to the time old question as to whether Sockets or
  STREAMS is faster.

- Redo performance tests for strxnet/strinet package using recent
  release of OpenSS7 Modified Netperf.

  *done*

- Perform x86_64 HT SMP testing.

  *done*
