Things to do:

   - Merge in upstream changes from the latest `Hewlett-Packard'
     release of the `Netperf' package into the `OpenSS7 Modified'
     version.  I would really like to do this but don't have the time
     for it right now.  If someone is willing to dive in and give this
     a try, send me the patches.

   - `Netperf' is capable of performing performance testing on `lksctp'
     as well.  I would like to modify the `OpenSS7' version of `Netperf'
     to support both so that performance comparison testing can be done
     between `lkstcp' (which sucks of course) and `OpenSS7 Linux Natve
     Sockets' version.

   - Get the `OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility' version working also with
     `OpenSS7 Linux Native Sockets SCTP' in addition to the current
     `STREAMS SCTP XTI' support.  This would not only allow `Netperf'
     to be used successfully with `OpenSS7 Linux Native SCTP', but it
     would also comparison tests between "STREAMS" and "Sockets"
     versions.  This is something that I would really like to do.  As
     `Linux Fast-STREAMS' "STREAMS"-based pipes beat FC4 Native pipes
     on 2.6.14 in a performance test, it would be interesting to see
     whether the "STREAMS" version can outpace the "Sockets" version.
     This would be an answer to the time old question as to whether
     "Sockets" or "STREAMS" is faster.

   * Redo performance tests for `strxnet'/`strinet' package using
     recent release of `OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility'.

     _*done*_

   * Perform x86_64 HT SMP testing.

     _*done*_
