The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 NETPERF Utility package as well as compatibility information of
OpenSS7 releases to the original Hewlett-Packard Company releases.

 Major changes for release netperf-2.3.4.rc3
--------------------------------------------

Added `--enable-devel' `configure' option for embedded targets.  Added
`send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

 Major changes for release netperf-2.3.3
----------------------------------------

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
compiler warnings.

 Major changes for release netperf-2.3.2
----------------------------------------

Many corrections (but not enough) are included to use the package for
XTI INET testing.  UDP works now, but TCP is not completely corrected
yet (and, therefore, neither is SCTP).  These capabilities could not
have possibly worked in the original `netperf-2.3' release.  The next
release should have TCP and SCTP corrected for XTI.

Corrections included to make the package cross-build for `NexusWare' as
well as recent 2.6.14 (FC4) kernels.

What remains to be done is to merge in the latest upstream release of
netperf into this package and contribute XTI corrections back upstream.

 Initial release netperf-2.3.1
------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `netperf' release.  It is based
on the Hewlett-Packard Company `netperf-2.3' release.

This release provides modifications to support the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and provides tests for the Sockets API for
the OpenSS7 Linux Native Kernel version of SCTP as well as tests for
the XTI API for the OpenSS7 STREAMS version of SCTP.  In addition, use
of the XTI API for TCP and UDP tests is supported using the OpenSS7
STREAMS INET package.

SCTP Sockets API tests depend upon the availability of an the OpenSS7
Sockets implementation of SCTP in an OpenSS7 patched kernel.  Some
binary kernels and prepatched kernel source for popular architectures
are provided as RPMs from the OpenSS7 Project download page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html).

SCTP XTI API tests depend upon the availability of the OpenSS7 STREAMS
implementation of SCTP.  Some binary and source packages for `LiS
STREAMS', `Linux Fast-STREAMS', the `strxnet' XTI/TLI library and the
`strsctp' package are available from the OpenSS7 Project download page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html).  *Note Introduction:
(libxnet)Top.

Under Linux, the TCP and UDP XTI API tests depend upon the availability
of the OpenSS7 INET driver.  Some binary and source packages for `LiS
STREAMS', `Linux Fast-STREAMS', the `strxnet' XTI/TLI library and the
`strinet' package (*note Introduction: (strinet)Top.) are available from
the OpenSS7 Project download page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html).  *Note Introduction:
(libxnet)Top.

This release also provides updates to the antiquated `netperf-2.1'
release documentation distributed with `netperf-2.3'.
