Prerequisites
-------------

The following are prerequisites for building the package:

 1. Linux distribution with a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel with the appropriate
    tool chain.  For supported and tested distributions, see the manual.

    (Note that although the original HP release of Netperf builds and
    installs on a number of operating systems, this OpenSS7 modified
    version only builds and install on Linux.)

 2. OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS or OpenSS7 Modified Linux STREAMS
    installed, such as
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/streams-0.7a.6.tar.bz2 or
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/LiS-2.18.4.tar.bz2

    (Note that the `LiS' package is deprecated.  We recommend using the
    `streams' package instead.)

 3. OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility Modules installed, such as
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2

 4. OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS installed, such as
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strxns-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2

 5. OpenSS7 STREAMS XTI/TLI Library installed, such as
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strxnet-0.9.2.9.tar.bz2

 6. OpenSS7 STREAMS INET Driver installed, such as
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strinet-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2

 7. OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP Driver installed, such as
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strsctp-0.9.2.6.tar.bz2

When configuring and building multiple OpenSS7 Project release packages,
place all of the source packages (unpackaged tarballs) at the same
directory level and all build directories at the same directory level.

Installation
------------

The following commands will download, configure, build, check, install,
validate, uninstall and remove the package:

	wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/netperf-2.3.4.tar.bz2
	tar -xjvf netperf-2.3.4.tar.bz2
	mkdir build
	pushd build
	../netperf-2.3.4/configure --enable-autotest
	make
	make check
	sudo make install
	sudo make installcheck
	sudo make uninstall
	popd
	sudo rm -rf build
	rm -rf netperf-2.3.4.
	rm -f netperf-2.3.4.tar.bz2

If you have problems, try building with the logging targets instead.  If
the make of a logging target fails, an automatic problem report will be
generated that can be mailed to The OpenSS7 Project.  Installation using
the logging targets proceeds as follows:

	wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/netperf-2.3.4.tar.bz2
	tar -xjvf netperf-2.3.4.tar.bz2
	mkdir build
	pushd build
	../netperf-2.3.4/configure --enable-autotest
	make compile.log
	make check.log
	sudo make install.log
	sudo make installcheck.log
	sudo make uninstall.log
	popd
	sudo rm -rf build
	rm -rf netperf-2.3.4.
	rm -f netperf-2.3.4.tar.bz2

See README-make for additional specialized make targets.

For custom applications, see the INSTALL and INSTALL-netperf files or
the installation and reference manual as listed below.  If you encounter
troubles, see the trouble shooting section of the installation and
reference manual before issuing a bug report.

Manual

Description
-----------

Netperf is a general purpose tool for benchmarking bandwidth and
performance of the Internet Protocol suite.  The OpenSS7 Modified
Netperf package is an OpenSS7 modified release of the HP netperf package
configured to run with OpenSS7 STREAMS SCTP (Stream Control Transmission
Protocol) and the OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI and INET packages.

This is a version of the Netperf package release by HP modified by the
OpenSS7 Project for use with OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS, XTI/TLI, INET and SCTP
packages.  This OpenSS7 release of the package is based on the
Netperf-2.3 release from HP.

Modifications to the package are derived from the OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS,
XTI/TLI, INET and SCTP implementations and are release under the GNU
General Public License (GPL) Version 2.  The Netperf tool itself is
licensed under specific terms by Hewlett-Packard.  Please see LICENSE
for the Hewlett-Packard Netperf copyright notices and licensing
restrictions.  The Netperf tool is

     Copyright (c) 1993, 1994, 1995 Hewlett-Packard Company
     All Rights Reserved

Please note that this modified version of the Netperf package is not
endorsed by Hewlett-Packard in any way and that neither the original
copyright holders nor OpenSS7 Corporation will take any responsibility
in it.

Brief Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

The OpenSS7 Modified Netperf package is available from the downloads
area of The OpenSS7 Project website:
<http://www.openss7.org/download.html> using a command such as:

	wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/netperf-2.3.4.tar.bz2

Unpack the tarball using a command such as:

	tar -xjvf netperf-2.3.4.tar.bz2

The tarball will unpack into the relative subdirectory named after the
package name: netperf-2.3.4  The package builds using the GNU autoconf
utilities and the `configure' script.  To build the package, we
recommend using a separate build directory as follows:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	../netperf-2.3.4/configure

In general, the package configures and builds without adding any special
options to the configure script.  For general options to the configure
script, see the GNU `INSTALL' file in the distribution:

	less ../netperf-2.3.4/INSTALL

For specific options to the configure script, see the INSTALL-netperf
file in the distribution, or simply execute the configure script with
the --help option like so:

	../netperf-2.3.4/configure --help

After configuring the package, the package can be compiled simply by
issuing the `make' command:

	make

Some specialized makefile targets exist, see the README-make file in the
distribution or simply invoke the `help' target like so:

	make help

After successfully building the package, the package can be checked by
invoking the `check' make target like so:

	make check

After successfully checking the package, the package can be installed by
invoking the `install' make target (as root) like so:

	sudo make install

The testsuites that ship with the package can be invoked after the
package has been installed by invoking the `installcheck' target.  This
target can either be invoked as root, or as a normal user, like so:

	make installcheck

(Note: you must add the --enable-autotest flag to `configure', above for
 the testsuites to be invoked with `make installcheck'.)

The package can be cleanly removed by invoking the `uninstall' target
(as root):

	sudo make uninstall

Then the build directory and tarball can be simply removed:

	cd ..
	rm -rf build
	rm -rf netperf-2.3.4
	rm -f netperf-2.3.4.tar.bz2
