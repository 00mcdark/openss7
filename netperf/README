BE SURE TO READ THE MANUAL.

This is a brief readme file for the netperf TCP/UDP/sockets/etc
performance benchmark. This is here mostly as a boot-strap. The real
information is in the manual, which can be found in netperf.ps and
online from http://www.netperf.org/netperf/NetperfPage.html. The
sources, and a limited number of binaries, can be found from
ftp://ftp.cup.hp.com/dist/networking/benchmarks/netperf/ .

BE SURE TO READ THE MANUAL.

There is a COPYRIGHT file included. It is based on what the HP Legal
Eagles gave me. I am not sure if the legalese is clear, but the intent
is to say "Here is a benchmark. Use it in good health. Pass it along,
port it, enhance it. You didn't pay for this tool, so don't expect it 
to be perfect ;-)" The rest of it is there to keep the layers happy...

Feel free to report results in public forums, but please be
excruciatingly complete in your description of the test envorinment.
Better still, report results to the netperf database at
http://www.netperf.org/netperf/NetperfPage.html.

There is an Internet mailing list devoted to netperf. It is called
netperf-talk and it is hosted on netperf.org. Subscription requests
should go to netperf-talk-request@netperf.org.

Please DO NOT SEND subscription requests to netperf-talk!

If you run into severe difficulties, or are just feeling chatty,
please feel free to drop some email to me - Rick Jones
<raj@cup.hp.com>. Be sure to include a meaningful subject lines.

happy benchmarking, 
rick jones
