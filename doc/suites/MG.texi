The MG Protocol Suite provides services using a number of @acronym{STREAMS} drivers and modules in
addition to user-space libraries and applications.  @cite{OpenSS7} provides a range of
@acronym{STREAMS} multiplexing drivers, pseudo-device drivers and pushable modules that complement
the primary MG multiplexing driver.

@figref{1} illustrates the @acronym{STREAMS} multiplexing drivers, pseudo-device drivers, and
pushable modules, and their organization.  The modules and drivers toward the top of the diagram are
associated with media gateway control and do not form part of the primary MG suite, but are
discussed in more detail in the VOIP suite.

@figuresized{mg01,1,Media Gateway Drivers and Modules,5.0in}

@node Drivers
@section Drivers

@subsection MG --- Media Gateway Multiplexing Driver

To provide for synchronization and load balancing, the MG driver uses a timing slot approach.
This is illustrated in @figref{2}.
The fundamental timing source is a 1 millisecond pulse.  This timing pulse is both divided and
distributed in single stage.  The timing pulse is divided to 10 milliseconds using 10 action lists.
Each action list has a pulse once every 10 milliseconds.

@figuresized{mg03,2,Timing Slots,2.5in}

This can be modelled using action trees.  The root of the tree is an action list node that executes
each of its sublists each millisecond.  The root node typically contains a single sublist that
contains a divider node that has @var{n} action sublists, and executes 1 of the @var{n} action
sublists every @var{n} milliseconds.

A typical arrangement for the MG driver would be to have a action node as the root node of the
action tree.  This node is executed every millisecond.  The action sublists consist of 5 divider
nodes: one for 10 milliseconds, one for 20 milliseconds, one for 30 milliseconds, 40 and 50.  The
divider nodes could be dynamically assigned (created when the first action requiring @var{n}
millisecond timing is required).  Each of these dividers represents a specific blocking size for RTP
channels or MX drivers.  Dividers with a smaller divisor (i.e. that execute more frequently) are
placed earlier in the lists than those that execute less frequently.  This can reduce overall jitter
in the system.  The assumption here is that processes that execute less frequently will be less
affected by delays in processing.  This is generally true for media streams.

The purpose of the action lists is to perform functions on a regular basis while distributing
actions over the available processor real-time.  Therefore, when action are added to action sublists
of divisor nodes, an attempt is made to equally distribute the load over the sublists.  This can
best be accomplished by assigning a relative weighting factor to the process and selecting the slot
on the basis of the accumulated load for other actions for each list.

So, for example, for tone generation being fed into many RTP channels with a 30 millisecond payload
size, each action node corresponding to an RTP channel is linked into a 30 millisecond
divider/distributor node that will feed some channels with tone samples every 30 milliseconds.  For
60,000 channels, 2,000 channels will be processed every millisecond, permitting 500 nanoseconds of
real-time per channel, per processor.

@subsection MATRIX --- Switching Matrix Multiplexing Driver

@subsection MX --- Multiplex Device Driver

@subsection CH --- Channel Device Driver

@subsection SX --- SONET/SDH Multiplexing Driver

@subsection RTP --- Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Driver

@subsection RSW --- RTP Switch (RSW) Driver

The RTP Switch (RSW) driver is a multiplexing driver that provides a switching matrix of multiplex
RTP media streams to and from the UDP driver that is linked beneath the multiplexer.  A single
multiplex UDP stream is provided at the lower interface and multiple UDP streams are provided at the
upper interface.  The driver provides simply switching between RTP streams at the lower interface.
This permits the RTP and RTCP packets from one UDP multiplex stream to be switched to and from
another UDP multiplex stream.

Because RTP/RTCP packets can be switched between any upper or lower channel and any other upper or
lower channel, this acts as a general purpose multiplexing driver.  Typical use is to open an
independent upper Stream for each AVT profile payload type and push an RTP module over each Stream
to perform jitter buffering and other RTP/RTCP termination functions.


@subsection UDP --- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Driver

The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) driver is a pseudo-device driver that provides access to the Linux
UDP subsystem for the purpose of supporting Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP).  This pseudo-device
networking driver is the second generation UDP driver (@file{/dev/udp2}) that is provided as a pure
@acronym{STREAMS} version of the older XTIoS driver.

This driver has been specially modified to also suit the needs of large-scale RTP implementations.
For large-scale devices it is not efficient to link each and every RTP media stream under a
multiplexing driver.  For example, should the application require 64,000 RTP media streams, the
normal UDP driver would require the opening and linking of 64,000 file descriptors.  This is not
possible on a normally configured Linux system (which has a maximum of about 8192 file descriptors).
Also, even it were possible, this would mean that each of the 64,000 queues would have to be
serviced once every 10 milliseconds or so.

To avoid this problem, the NPI service interface was altered on one of the clone minor device nodes
of the UDP2 driver to permit an unlimited number of NPI connections to be managed on a single
Stream.  This was accomplished by prepending a 64-bit tag to each and every NPI service primitive
send on the Stream.

@node Modules
@section Modules

@subsection RTP --- Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Module

The RTP module is a module pushed over a UDP Stream or multi-Stream that provides RTP jitter
buffering and resynchronization, independent of the AVT payload.  This is accomplished using only
the RTP header fields.  The only buffering that is performed is buffering out of sequence packets
awaiting messing packets in the sequence (reordering).  Complete sequences of packets are delivered
upstream as soon as they are available.  This buffering and resequencing can be performed in both
directions.  Media streams that do not require buffering will simply be monitored as the algorithm
has no effect on correctly ordered packets.  When delays awaiting missing packets exceeds specified
parameters, subsequent packets will be delivered.  Should the missing packet later arrive, it will
be dropped.  Because the module does not know about payload formats, it does not attempt to fill in
silence or any other substitute for missing packets.

The RTP module can support RTCP control and reporting on any RTP media channel.

The RTP module can also support a pass-through capability on RTP media channels.  This is useful for
AVT profile payload formats that do not require state information for reassembly (such as G.711).
In this case, there is simply a 1:1 packet sequence mapping between the input and output channels.
Nevertheless, when in transparent mode, the RTP module can still support RTCP control and reporting.

The RTP module is normally pushed over a multi-Stream UDP driver that provides the UDP connectivity
for supporting many RTP media channels.  It presents a control interface based on NPI just as does
the UDP multi-stream pseudo-device driver.

@subsection RTP-CH --- Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Channel (CH) Module

The RTP-CH module is an RTP to Channel conversion module that support transcoding.  This module is
intended on being pushed over an RTP module.  It supports a multi-Stream Channel Interface (CHI) at
the upper interface and a UDP interface using the multi-Stream Network Provider Interface (NPI) at
the lower interface.  The purpose of this module is to adapt between an MG driver lower multiplex at
the upper interface and a multi-Stream UDP driver or RTP Switch driver at the lower interface.

The module expects de-jittered RTP input at the lower interface and unpacks and transcodes the AVT
profile payload into channel samples that are PCM A-Law, @math{\mu}-Law or Linear (signed 16-bit).
The module expects a steady stream of PCM A-Law, @math{\mu}-Law or Linear (signed 16-bit) samples on
the upper interface which it will encode in the appropriate format for output on the lower
interface.  The simplest instance of the RTP-CH module simply packs and unpacks PCM @math{\mu}-Law
samples to and from G.711 RTP packets.

For efficiency on large scale systems, one RTP-CH module instance should be created for each coding
format.  This is so that instruction caches will be kept hot for transcoding blocks of packets.


@subsection RTP-TEST --- Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Test Driver

The RTP Test module is a @acronym{STREAMS} module that can be pushed over a multiplex UDP Stream and
provides the ability to generate a significant amount of RTP media traffic for testing purposes.
UDP multiplex NPI control messages are transparently passed through the module to the lower UDP
multiplex Stream, forming and releasing connections as required.  However, multiplex UDP NPI data
messages received from the lower Stream are simply discarded; whereas, UDP NPI data messages written
to the module on multiplex 0 are duplicated to each of the connected UDP NPI multiplexes on the
lower interface.
