.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
This is the
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ " ( @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ )
package for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.PP
OpenSS7
.I STREAMS
add-on packages are separate add-on packages to the
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS"
.[
lfs
.]
release that provide additional functionality and protocol support not traditionally found on UNIX
systems, or which have traditionally fallen into the domain of value-add system software, or, in 
this case, where funtionality was options or differently handled in a number of implementations.
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is one of the several optional add-on packages that provide enhanced network protocol
support beyond that provided by the base
.I STREAMS
package.  This package provides support for communications devices and protocols based on the
.IR "Communications Device Interface (CDI)" ,
.BR cdi (7),
.IR "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)" ,
.BR dlpi (7),
and
.IR "Network Provider Interface (NPI)" ,
.BR npi (7),

environment.
.PP
This distribution is only currently applicable to
.B Linux
2.4 and 2.6 kernels and was targeted at
.IR ix86 ", " x86_64 ", " ppc " and " ppc64

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Although previous releases of the
.B @PACKAGE@
package were tested with
.IR LiS ,
.I LiS
is now deprecated and this release of
.B @PACKAGE@
has not been tested with
.IR LiS .
.I The OpenSS7 Project
will no longer support this package for
.IR LiS :
please upgrade to
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .

.SH BUGS
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE@
package has been tested with a wide array of production
.B Linux
distributions, kernels, and target architectures, and is largely considered production grade by
.IR "The OpenSS7 Project" .
At the time of release, the
.B @PACKAGE@
package had no known bugs.  Problems can be reported to
.RB < bugs@openss7.org >.
Please, however, use the included
.B send-pr
script for generating actionable problem reports.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE@
package is compatible with
.I SVR 4.2
and systems based on
.I SVR 4.2
such as
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
All of the drivers and modules in this package provide access to data links or
network interfaces using the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
or Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
and are compatible with
.I SVR 4.2
implementations based on these standard
.I STREAMS
service interfaces.
.IP \(em
The
.BR ldl (4)
driver provides access to
.B Linux
network devices presenting the
Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7).
.IP \(em
The
.BR ip_to_dlpi (4)
driver and the
.BR ip_strm_mod (4)
module provide access to
.I STREAMS
IP interfaces conforming to to the
Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
from the
.B Linux
IP subsystem.
The driver uses an
.IR I_LINK (7)
approach, whereas the module provides an
.IR I_PUSH (7)
approach.
.IP \(em
The
.BR np_ip (4)
driver is compatible with implementation of the IP subsystem that conform to
the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7).

.SH HISTORY
.PP
A number of the modules and drivers contained in this package started out in the
.I LiS
distribution.  However,
.I LiS
distributions had broken DLPI and NPI header files and these were replaced by those written for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
Additional drivers (such as the
.BR np_ip (4)
driver) were added later and are developments of
.IR "The OpenSS7 Project" .
