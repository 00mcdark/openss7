The fields in this structure are:
.\"
.TP
.IR fastselreq
Applies only to non-OSI applications, for example X.29.  A non-zero value means
the X.25 facility fast select is to be requested or indicated.  Note: For CONS,
the use of fast select need not be requested.
.\"
.TP
.IR restrictresponse
Sets response to be a Clear Request.  If the response to a Connect Request or
Indication is to be a Disconnect Indication, the filed
.I restrictresponse
is non-zero.
.\"
.TP
.IR reversecharges
A non-zero value means that reverse charging is requested or indicated for this
connection.  Note: The configuration mode bit,
.BR SUB_REVCHARGE ,
has an impact on whether reverse charging is indicated, since it is possible to
select a per-subnetwork-status for receipt of reverse charging.
.\"
.TP
.IR pwoptions
The
.I pwoptions
field is used to indicate per (virtual) circuit options.  The field is a bit
map interpreted as shown below:

.PP
This field is used for two reasons:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The X.25 software always indicates the values of the window and packet sizes
operating on the virtual circuit.  The field
.I pwoptions
for an incoming call indicates whether these values are negotiable.
.IP 2.
In Connect Requests and Connect Resposnes, the NLI user can set
.IR nsdulimit ,
the limit value for packet concatentation by the X.25 level, to a value
different from the limit in the subnetwork configuration database.  It is not
a negotiable option, so whatever the user requests is used.
.RE
.\"
.TP
.IR locpacket ", " rempacket
If the fields
.IR locpacket " and " rempacket
are non-zero,
.I locpacket
contains indicated or negotiated encoded packet sizes for the direction
local-to-remote and
.I rempacket
contains the indicated or negotiated encoded packet sizes for the direction
remote-to-local.
The actual packet size is 2 to the power of the value specified.
The standard default packet size,
.BR DEF_X25_PKT ,
is

.\"
.TP
.IR locwsize ", " remwsize
If the fields
.IR locwsize " and " remwsize

directions local-to-remote and remote-to-local.  The standard default window
size,
.BR DEF_X25_WIN
is
.BR 2 .
.\"
.TP
.I nsdulimit
Specifies the packet concatenation limit.
If the field
.I nsdulimit
is non-zero and the appropriate bit is set in the

specified is ued as the concatentation limit.

The

.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,

are consistent in their documentation of the
.B extraformat
structure.
.IP \(em
NLI is an inherently low level and non-portable interface and should not be
used by portable programs.  Portable programs should use the NPI or XX25
interfaces in its stead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted: only a rough source compatibility.  Any
binary compatibility exhibited is a bug and is scheduled to be removed in the
next release.

implementation of NLI conforms to documentation for Version 3 of the NLI.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The NLI is an interface originally developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now a
division of Emmerson Power).  The NLI interface found its way into may
mainstream UNIX implementations and UNIX-like RTOS sporting STREAMS such as
Windriver's VxWorks.  The NLI was never standardized and remains an inherently
non-portable interface.
