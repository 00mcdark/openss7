This is the

package for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[
lfs
.]
.PP
OpenSS7
.I STREAMS
add-on packages are separate add-on packages to the
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
release that provide additional functionality and protocol support not traditionally found on UNIX
systems, or which have traditionally fallen into the domain of value-add system software, or, in
this case, where the functionality was optional or differently handled in a number of implementations.  The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is one of several optional add-on packages that provide enhanced
.I STREAMS
support beyond that provided by the base
.I STREAMS
packages.  This package provides support for
network protocols,
not provided by the base
.I STREAMS
package.
.\"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The

package provides
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers, libraries, programs, initialization scripts, and daemons that
implement
.IR "Open Systems Interconnect"
.[

The
.B @PACKAGE@
package is compatible with
.I SVR 4.2
and systems based on
.I SVR 4.2
such as
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:

.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides compatibility with all implementations of the ISO/OSI Protocol suite
using the
Data Link Provider Interface Revision 2.0.0,

dlpi revision 2.0.0

Network Provider Interface Revision 2.0.0,

and
Transport Provider Interface Revision 1.5 or 2.0.0
specifications.

These drivers are designed to operate with the XTI/TLI library implementation
provided by the
.BR strxnet (5)
package and is thus compatible with most XTI library implementations as well.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
The contents of the
.B @PACKAGE@
package were formerly part of the
.BR strss7 (5)
package.  As of
.BR "@PACAKGE@-@VERSION@" ,
the ISO/OSI components were moved out of the
.BR strss7 (5)
package into this
.BR striso (5)
package.  This package now contains all of the ISO/OSI protocol components released by
.IR "The OpenSS7 Project" ,
along with associated documentation.
.PP
In the initial releases of the
.BR striso (5)
package, only ISO/OSI modules and drivers that have been fully revalidated on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
were initially released.  The remaining components present on the CVS archive and formerly part of the commercial
.BR sstrss7 (5)
releases, will be publicly released in releases subsequent to
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
as they are revalidated.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATUS
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is
.I production
grade on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
for the modules and drivers included in the public release.  Not all OpenSS7
Project ISO/OSI modules and drivers have been included in the release
distribution.  The OpenSS7 project is in the process of revalidating all
project modules and drivers for use on
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
As a result, additional release components will be strapped into the package
and once full validation test suites are developed and run against each
component.
.PP
In particular, the following modules and drivers are currently missing from
the public release:
