.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
This is the
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ " ( @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ )
package for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[
lfs
.]
.PP
OpenSS7
.I STREAMS
add-on packages are separate add-on packages to the
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
release that provide additional functionality and protocol support not
traditionally found on UNIX systems, or which have traditionally fallen into
the domain of value add system software, or, in this case, where the
functionality was applicable to
.I LiS
(to provide
.I LiS
with support for some of the enhanced capabilities of
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" ).
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is one of several add-on packages that provides enhanced
.I STREAMS
support beyond that provided by the base
.I LiS
package.  This package provides fundamental
.I STREAMS
facilities missing from
.I LiS
releases.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package provides
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers, libraries, programs, init scripts, and daemons that
implement fundamental
.I STREAMS
utilities missing from
.I LiS
releases.
.PP
The package builds and installs the following kernel modules:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.TP
.BR log (4)
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package includes kernel modules,
.I SVR 4.2 STREAMS
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and
development environment for the development and execution of
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
protocol stack components and applications for the
.I SVR 4.2 STREAMS
environment.
.PP
This distribution is only currently applicable to
.B Linux
2.4 and 2.6 kernels and was targeted at
.IR ix86 ", " x86_64 ", " ppc " and " ppc64
architectures, but should build and install for other architectures as well.
.PP
This package provides some fundamental
.I STREAMS
utilities not part of any
.I LiS
release but which are incorporated into
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
The purpose of this separate package was to provide
.I LiS
releases with some of these missing capabilities until such time as
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS"
became production grade.  As
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS"
is has been production grade for some time and
.I LiS
is has been deprecated for some time, this package is historical.

package were tested with

is now deprecated and this release of

has not been tested with
.IR LiS .
.I The OpenSS7 Project
will no longer support this package for
.IR LiS :
please upgrade to
