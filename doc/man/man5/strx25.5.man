package for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[

.]
.PP
OpenSS7
.I STREAMS
add-on packages are separate add-on packages to the
.B "Linux Fast-STREAMS"
.[
lfs
.]
release that provide additional functionality and protocol support not
traditionally found on UNIX base systems, or which have traditionally fallen
into the domain of value-add system software, or, in this case, where the
functionality was optional or differently handled in a number of
implementations.  The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is one of several optional add-on packages that provide enhanced
.I STREAMS
support beyond that provided by the base
.I STREAMS
packages.  This package provides support for network protocols, not provided
by the base
.I STREAMS
package.

that implement the

.I pre-alpha
release.  Some defects might be harmful.  No validation testing whatsoever has
been performed by the
.I OpenSS7 Project
on this software.  The software might not even configure or compile.  The

will irreparably mangle your header files or Linux distribute in such a way as
to make it unusable.  Crashes will lock your system and rebooting the system
will not repair the problem.  You will lose all the data on your system.
Because this software will crash your kenrel, the resulting unstable system
can destroy computer hardware or peripherals making them unusable.  You will
void the warranty on any system on which you run this software.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
The contents of the
.B @PACKAGE@
package were formerly part of the
.BR strss7 (5)
package and then the
.BR striso (5)
package.  As of
.BR @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ ,
the X.25 components were moved out of the
.BR striso (5)
package into this
.BR @PACKAGE@ (5)
package.  This package now contains all of the X.25 protocol components
released by
.IR "The OpenSS7 Project" ,
along with associated documentation.
.PP
In the initial release of the
.BR strx25 (5)
package, only X.25 modules and drivers that have been fully revalidated on
.BR Linux Fast-STREAMS
were initially released.  The remaining components present on the CVS archive
and formerly part of the commercial
.BR striso (5)
releases, will be publicly released in released subsequent to
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
as they are revalidated.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATUS
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TILE@
package is
.I production
grade on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
for the modules drivers included in the public release.  Not all OpenSS7
Project X.25 modules and drivers have been included in the release
distribution.  The OpenSS7 project is in the process or revalidating all
project modules and drivers for use on
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
As a result, additional release components will be strapped into the package
and once full validation test suites are developed and run against each
component.
.PP
In particular, the following modules and drivers are currently missing format
the public release.
