.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
This is the
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ " ( @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ )
package for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[
lfs
.]
.PP
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" ,
.BR streams (5),
consists of a base package that provides basic
.I SVR 4.2 STREAMS
capabilities for
.B Linux
and a number of separate add-on packages.
.PP
OpenSS7
.I STREAMS
add-on packages provide additional functionality and protocol support not traditionally found on
UNIX systems, or which have traditionally fallen into the domain of value-add system software, or,
in this case, where functionality was optional or differently handled in a number of
implementations.
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is one of the several optional add-on packages that provide support for ISDN and is
part of the thrust of the
.IR "OpenSS7 Project" .
.[

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package provides
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers, libraries, programs, init scripts, and daemons that
implement the
.I STREAMS
ISDN subsystem.
.PP
The package builds and installs the following
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers (as kernel modules):
.IP \(en \w'\(en\(em'u
.B streams_lapd.ko
driver
.IR /dev/lapd .
.PD 0
.IP \(en
.B streams_isdn.ko
driver
.IR /dev/isdn .
.PD
.PP
The following are
.I STREAMS
modules installed by the
.B @PACKAGE@
package:
.TP
.BR lapd (4)
The
.BR lapd (4)
driver is a multiplexing pseudo-device driver that links
.BR hdlc (4)
Streams beneath it.  It uses the Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.BR cdi (7),
at its lower multiplex boundary and the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
at its upper multiplex boundary.
.TP
.BR isdn (4)
The
.BR isdn (4)
driver is a multiplexing pseudo-device driver that links
.BR lapd (4)
or
.BR iua (4)
Streams beneath it.  It uses the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
at its lower multiplex boundary and the Call Control Interface (CCI),
.BR cci (7),
at its upper multiplex boundary.
.TP
.BR capi (4)
The
.BR capi (4)
driver is an implementation of the Common ISDN API (CAPI), Version 2.0.
.[
capi20
.]
This driver provides
.I STREAMS
access
(both
.IR STREAMS -based
CAPI as well as the
Call Control Interface (CCI),
.BR cci (7))
to
.B Linux
CAPI devices as well as providing Linux CAPI access to
.BR isdn (4),
.BR dass (4)
and
.BR dpnss (4)
devices.
.IP ""
This driver is currently incomplete.
.TP
.BR dass (4)
The
.BR dass (4)
driver is a DASS
.[
dass2
.]
version of the
.BR isdn (4)
driver.
.IP ""
This driver is currently incomplete.
.TP
.BR dpnss (4)
The
.BR dpnss (4)
driver is a DPNSS
.[

.]
version of the
.BR isdn (4)
driver.

.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE@
package also provides the following service interface definitions:
.TP
.BR cci (7)
The
Call Control Interface (CCI),
.BR cci (7),
is a call control interface for use by ISDN, ISUP, H.323, SIPT and BICC,
developed by the OpenSS7 Project.  Because
.BR strisdn (5)
is the first add-on package in the dependency chain to require the Call
Control Interface, it also provides the interface.  This interface is also
used by the
.BR strss7 (5),
.BR sigtran (5)
and
.BR strvoip (5)
add-on packages.
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package includes kernel modules,
.I SVR 4.2 STREAMS
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the
development and execution of
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
protocol stack components and applications for the
.I SVR 4.2 STREAMS
environment.
.PP
This distribution is only currently applicable to
.B Linux
2.4 and 2.6 kernels and was targeted at
.IR ix86 ", " x86_64 ", " ppc " and " ppc64
architectures, but should build and install for other architectures as well.
.PP
This package represents ISDN components that were previously part of the
.BR strss7 (5)
package, but which were separated into this package at the end of 2006.  Although this manual page
documents all commercial components in the
.BR strisdn (5)
package, not all components have been released publicly.

could possibly contain unknown defects.  This is a

release.  Nevertheless, some remaining unknown defects could possibly be
harmful.  Validation testing has been performed by the
.I OpenSS7 Project
and external entities on this software for the set of systems listed in the
release notes.  Nevertheless, the software might still fail to configure or
compile on other systems.  The

recommends that you validate this software for your target system before using
this software.  Use at your own risk.  Remember that there is

This software is
.I production
software.  As such, it is stable on validated systems but might still crash
your kernel in unique circumstances.  Installation of the software on a
non-validated distribution might mangel your header files or Linux
distribution in such a way as to make it unusable and rebooting the system
might not repair the problem.  You could possibly lose all the data on your
system.  Because this software stands a chance of crashing your kernel, the
resulting unstable system could possibly destroy computer hardware or
peripherals making them unusable.  You might void the warranty on any system
on which you run this fotware.

.SH BUGS
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE@
package has been tested with a wide array of production
.B Linux
distributions, kernels, and target architectures, but is considered alpha
grade by
.IR "The OpenSS7 Project" .
At the time of release, the
.B @PACKAGE@
package had no known bugs.  Problems can be reported to
.RB < bugs@openss7.org >.
Please, however, use the included
.B send-pr
script for generating actionable problem reports.  Please see the file

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
Application programming interfaces for ISDN and other modules
and drivers have not been standardized by a formal standards body.  For the
most part, ISDN implementations have used proprietary interfaces for accessing
the various protocol layers of the ISDN stack.
.PP
The
.I OpenSS7 Project
also uses project-specific (but open) interfaces at a number of layers where a standard
is lacking.  Nevertheless, standard service interfaces are used for a number of
layers in the ISDN components and even in the upper level ISDN components.
These standardized service interfaces are based on the
Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.BR cdi (7),
the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
the Transport Provider Interface (TPI),
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
and the Call Control Interface (CCI),
.BR cci (7).
.PP
.I OpenSS7 Project
ISDN components use the same interfaces as are provided for use by SS7/ISDN
components at the same protocol level.  This makes
.I OpenSS7 Project
ISDN components automatically compatible with OpenSS7 SS7
and ISDN components.

.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
In general, there are few conformance specifications to which to test ISDN
components.  Nevertheless, a few exist as follows:

For additional description of conformance and validation test suites and the
standards to which the tests are performed, see the manual page for the
appropriate protocol driver or module.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
The contents of the
.B @PACKAGE@
package were formerly part of the
.BR strss7 (5)
package.  As of
.BR "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" ,
the ISDN components were moved out of the
.BR strss7 (5)
package into this
.BR strisdn (5)
package.  This package now contains all of the ISDN components released by
.IR "The OpenSS7 Project" ,
along with associated documentation.
.PP
In the initial release of the
.BR strisdn (5)
package, only ISDN modules and drivers that have been fully revalidated on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
were initially released.  The remaining components present on the CVS archive and formerly part of the commercial
.BR strss7 (5)
releases, will be publicly released in releases subsequent to
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
as they are revalidated.
.\"

.SH STATUS
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is
.I production
grade on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
for the modules and drivers included in the public release.  Not all OpenSS7
project ISDN modules and drivers have been included in the release
distribution.  The OpenSS7 Project is in the process of revalidating all
package modules and drivers for use on
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
As a result, additional release components will be strapped into the package
once full validation test suites are developed and run against each
component.
.PP
In particular, the following modules and drivers are currently missing from
the public release:
