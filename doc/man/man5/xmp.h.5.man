.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xmp.h>
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.RB < xmp.h >
header file contains common definitions for the access to the Management Communication Service.
.PP
The interface uses part of the C public namespace for its facilities.  All identifiers start with
the letters '\fImp\fP', '\fIMP\fP' or '\fIOMP\fP', and more detail of the conventions used are given
in the following table.  Note that the interface reserves \fIall\fP identifiers starting with the
letters '\fImpP\fP' for Private (i.e\&. internal) use by implementations of the interface.  It also
reserves \fIall\fP identifiers starting with the letters '\fImpX\fP' or '\fIMPX\fP' for
vendor-specific extensions of the interface.  Application programmers should not use any identifier
staring with these letters.
.PP
The OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation API uses similar, though not identical, naming conventions which
are described in XOM.
.[
xom c607
.]
All its identifiers are prefixed by the letters '\fIOM\fP' or '\fIom\fP'.
