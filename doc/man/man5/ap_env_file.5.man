.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual page defines the format of an ACSE/Presentation Library
initalizationa file.
.PP
An
.B ap_env_file
is an ASCII file contianing a list of XAP environment variable assignments.
It is used as input to the
.BR ap_osic (1)
command, which generates a compiled version of the assignments for use as an
environment initialization file by the
.BR ap_init_env (3)
function.  Support of the
.BR ap_osic (1)
command and the initialization of the XAP environment from an input file is
optional, so this mechanism may not be available in all implementations of
XAP.
.PP
Each
.B ap_env_file
file consists of the following types:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Assignment paris of the form:
.RS
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
<attribute-name> = <value>\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.sp
where
.B <attribute-name>
is the name of an XAP library environment attribute and
.B <value>
is a legal value for the attribute.
.IP \(bu
C-style comments (/* ... */) with the syntax and semantifcs defined by ISO C.
.IP \(bu
.B #include
lines with the syntax and semantics defined by the ISO C
preprocessor.
.IP \(bu
.B #define
lines with the syntax and semantics defined by the ISO c preprocessor for
the '#define identifier token-sequence' form.
.PP
An entry may be split across multiple lines by terminating intermediate lines
with a backslash character (\\).  Otherwise each entry must occupy a signle
line.
.PP
An
.B ap_env_file
file may contain assignments for any of the settable XAP Library environment
attribtutes.  The assignment pair may appear in any order provided each pair
begins on a new line.
.PP
As not all attributes are of the same type, the format of
.B <value>
depends upon the particular attribute being initialized.  The table that
follows lists all of the attributes that may be initialized in an
.B ap_env_file
file and the format each requires for the
.B <value>
component of its initialization pair.

Below is a description of the
.B <value>
formats specified in the preceding table.  Note that blanks, newlines,
horizontal and vertical tabs and form feeds in the
.B ap_env_file
file are considered
.I white space
and are ignored except as token separators.
.TP
.B Address
Values in this format must be given as

.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
{ [p_selector], [s_selector], [t_selector], {{n_address}, [,{n_address}]*}}

.fi
.sp
where the components are defined as follows:
.sp
.TP
.I p_selector
A value in the octet string format of any length.
.TP
.I s_selector
A value in the octet string format whose length cannot exceed 16 octets.
.TP
.I t_selector
A value in the octet string format whose length cannot exceed 32 octets.
.TP
.I n_address
One or more network addresses may be specified here in a comma separated list.
Each network address is represented by a value in the octet string format
whose length is less than or equal to 20, followed by an integer constant
declaring the associated network type. When multiple network address
components are included in a presentation address, the specific network
address(es) chosen by the provider and the manner by which it is selected for
initiating or listening to connections is not specified by XAP and is a local
implementation issue.
.RE
.TP
.B Bitmask
Values in this format must be given as one or more items in the integer
constant format OR'ed together (C-style).
.TP
.B Connection\0Identifier
Values in this format must be given as a sequence of 3 values in the octet
string format enclosed in braces and separated by commas.  The 3 elements of
this sequence correspond, in order, to the Calling (or Called) SS-user
reference, Common reference, and Additional reference information components
of the session connecion identifier parameter.
.TP
.B Context\0Definition\0List
Values in this format must eb given as a sequence of comma-separated 3-tuples
enclosed in braces.  Each 3-tuple comprises the following comma-separated
elements:
.sp
.RS
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
a presentation context identifier in integer constant format,
.IP 2.
an abstract syntax name in object identifier format,
.IP 3.
a braced, comma separated sequence of transfer syntax names where each
transfer syntax name is in object identifier format.
.RE
.TP
.B Default\0Context\0Name
Values in this format must be given as a 2-tuple enclosed in braces.  The
first element of the 2-tupe is an abstract syntax name; the second is a
transfer syntax name.  Both elements must be in the object identifier format
and the two elements are separated by a comma.
.TP
.B Integer\0Constant
Values in this format must be given as one of the following:
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
a decimal integer,
.IP \(bu
an octal integer (prefixed by 0),
.IP \(bu
a hexadecimal integer (prefixed by 0x or 0X),
.IP \(bu
a sybolic constant that is either defined by the user in the
.B ap_env_file
file (using
.BR #define ),
or defined in a file included in the
.B ap_env_file
file (using
.BR #include ).
.PP
Note that the constants in the
.B <xap.h>
file are included automatically.  Users are cautioned against redefining any
of the constants in that file.
.RE
.TP
.B Object\0Identifier
Values in this format must be given as a sequence of values in the integer
constant format that are separated by blanks and enclosed in braces.  The
following identifiers of OBJECT IDENTIFIER component values have been assiged
by ISO and CCITT and are recognized by
.BR ap_osic (1):
.sp
.RS
.RS
.BR iso ,
.BR standard ,
.BR registration_authority ,
.BR member_body ,

.BR ccitt ,
.BR recommendation ,
.BR question ,
.BR administration ,
.BR network_operator ,
.BR joint_iso_ccitt ,
.BR asn1 ,
.BR basic_encoding
.RE
.PP
Note that the above identifiers use a "_" (underscore) character as a
separated instead of a "-" (hyphen).  For example, joint-iso-ccitt is defined
as joint_iso_ccitt.  Since the environment file format is "C" structure based,
using a "-" as a separator would constitute an expression and not a
definition.
Also, the user may define other identifier values by using the
.B #define
preprocessor construct.
.RE
.TP
.B Octet\0String
Values in this format must be given as either an even number of hexadecimal
digits or a legal C language string constant enclosed in braces.  Characters
in string constants will be treated as 8-bit values where bit 8 (MSB) is 0 and
the low order 7 bits correspond to the character's ASCII encoding.
.TP
.B Encoded\0String
Values in this format must be given as a single value in the octet string
format.  This octet string must correspond to a valid encoding of an ASN.1
type value.
.TP
.B Quality\0of\0Service

The OpenSS7 XAP Library supports \fINULL\fP bit-strings for the AP_ACSE_AVAIL, AP_ACSE_SEL,
AP_PRES_AVAIL, AP_PRES_SEL, AP_SESS_AVAIL and AP_SESS_SEL environment attributes.  When the
corresponding bit-string is \fINULL\fP, it indicates that either the entire layer is unavailable, or
the entire layer is removed (\fINULL\fP) and service primitives for the layer are mapped directly
onto service primitives for the lower layer.

This is not specified in XAP,
