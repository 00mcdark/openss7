.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The members of the
.B xaddrf
structure are as follows:
.TP
.I sn_id
The subnetwork identifier, selected by the system administrator.  It
identifies the subnetwork required for a conenction request, or on which a
connection indication arrived.  The
.I sn_id
field holds a representation of the one to four byte string subnetwork
identifier as an unsigned long integer.  The X.25 library routine
.BR snidtox25 (3)
can be used to convert the character subnetwork identifier to an unsigned long
integer.
.TP
.I link_id
Holds the link number as 32-bit unsigned integer.  By default
.I link_id
has a value of
.BR 0xff .
WHen
.I link_id
is
.BR 0xff ,
the X.25 provider attempts to match the called address with an entry in a
routing configuration file.  If it cannot find a match, it routes the call
over the lowest numbered WAN link.
.TP
.I aflags
Specifies the options required (or used) by the subnetwork to encode and
interpret addresses.
When there is a valud in the
.I NSAP
field,
.I aflags takes one of the three values listed below.  When the
.I NSAP
field is empty,
.I aflags
has the value zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.I aflags
takes one of the following values:
.RS
.PP
.TS
tab(:);
lblblbss
lilblss.
Symbol:Value:Meaning
_
NSAP_ADDR:0x00:T{
NSAP field contains OSI-encoded NSAP address.
T}
EXT_ADDR:0x01:T{
NSAP field contains non-OSI-encoded extended address.
T}
PVC_LCI:0x02:T{
NSAP field contains a PVC number.

.TE
.RE
.TP
.I DTE_MAC
The DTE address, or LSAP as two BCD digits per byte, right justified, or the
.B PVC_LCI
as three BCD digits with two digits per byte, right justified.
Holds the DTE address, the MAC plus SAP (Medium Access Control plus Service
Access Point) address on the LCI.  This is binary.  The
.BR lsapformat (5)
structure is described separately.
.TP
.I nsap_len
The length in semi-octets of the NSAP as two BCD digits per byte, right
justified.
.TP
.I NSAP
The NSAP or address extension (see
.IR aflags )
as two BCD digits per byte, right justified.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B xaddrf
structure is the primary structure used for defining X.25 addresses for the
Network Layer Interface (NLI),
.BR nli (7).
In call requests and responses, it is necessary to specify the X.25 address
associated with the connection: the called, calling and responding addresses.
The
.B xaddrf
structure is used for these addresses.  The addresing format used by this
structure provides the following information:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
The subnetwork on which outgoing connection requests are to be sent and on
which connection indications arrive.
.IP \(bu
NSAP (Network Service Access Points) and SNPA (Subnetwork Point of
Attachments), or DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) addresses and LSAP (Link
Service Access Points).
.IP \(bu
Options in encoding of addresses (NSAP).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Network Layer Interface (NLI) is a proprietary interface without a formal
standard.  Either the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
or the XTI-X25 interface,
.[
xx25
.]
.BR xti_x25 (3),
should be used in its stead.

.SH FILES
.PP
The
.B xaddrf
structure is defined in the

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B xaddrf
structure is compatible with NLI, and implementations based on NLI such as
.BR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.BR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.BR "HP-UX X.25/9000" ,
.BR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg
.[
solx25pg
.]
describes the first field as the
.I link_id
and it is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
.IR "IRIX SX.25" \(rg
.[
sx25
.]
and
.IR "PT X.25"
.[
ptx25
.]
describe the first field as the
.I sn_id
and it is an unsigned long integer (which is 32-bit on IL32 and 64-bit on
LP64).
To avoid performing data model conversion between user space and kernel
modules,
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
makes the first member of the
.B xaddrf
structure an 32-bit unsigned integer.
.IP \(em
.IR "IRIX SX.25" \(rg
.[
sx25
.]
and
.IR "PT X.25"
.[
ptx25
.]
do not document symbolic constants for the values of the
.I aflags
member.
.IP \(em
NLI is an inherently low level and non-portable interface and should not be
used by portable programs.  Portable programs should use the NPI or XX25
interfaces in its stead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted: only a rough source compatibility.  Any
binary compatibility exhibited is a bug and is scheduled to be removed in the
next release.
.PP
See
.BR NLI (7),
.IR STREAMS (4),
for additional compatiblity considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The NLI is not a formal standard.  The
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implementation of NLI conforms to documentation for Version 3 of the NLI.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The NLI is an interface originally developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now a
division of Emmerson Power).  The NLI interface found its way into may
mainstream UNIX implementations and UNIX-like RTOS sporting STREAMS such as
Windriver's VxWorks.  The NLI was never standardized and remains an inherently
non-portable interface.
