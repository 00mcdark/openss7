.SH NAME
.B wanmapconf
\- Wide Area Network mapping configuration file
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B wanmapconf
file contains information regarding the mapping between remote addresses of
network hosts and underlying interface addresses.  It is loaded into the WAN
driver,
.BR wan (4),
by
.BR wanmap (8),
and is stored in the WAN internal address table.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
Each line should contain a remote address followed by an interface address,
separated by whitespace.  Items are separated by any number of spaces and/or
table characters.  A
.RB ' # '
indicates the beginning of a commend; characters up to the end of the line
are not interpreted by routine that search the file.  The remote address may
be either a destination name of X.121 address.
.PP
The interface address follows the format for the corresponding interface.
.\"
.\"
