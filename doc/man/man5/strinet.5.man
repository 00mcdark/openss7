.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
This is the
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ " ( @PACKAGE@ - @VERSION@ )
package for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[
lfs
.]
.PP
OpenSS7
.I STREAMS
add-on packages are separate add-on packages to the
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
release that provide additional functionality and protocol support not traditionally found on UNIX
systems, or which have traditionally fallen into the domain of value-add system software, or, in
this case, where the functionality was optional or differently handled in a number of implementations.  The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is one of several optional add-on packages that provide enhanced
.I STREAMS
support beyond that provided by the base
.I STREAMS
package.  This package provides support for Internet Protocols based on the
.IR "Transport Provider Interface (TPI)" ,
.BR tpi (7),
not provided by the base
.I STREAMS
package.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package provides
.IR STREAMS (9)
modules and drivers, libraries, programs, initialization scripts, and daemons that
implement and provide
networking protocols based on the transport layer of the OSI
reference model.
.[
x200
.]
.PP
The package currently provides the following
.IR STREAMS (9)
modules and drivers:
.ad l
.IP \(en \w'\(en\(em'u
.B streams_inet.ko
driver
.PD 0
.IP \(en
.B streams_rawip.ko
driver
.IP \(en
.B streams_tcp.ko
driver
.IP \(en
.B streams_udp.ko
driver
.ad b
.PD
.PP
The following are
.I STREAMS
drivers installed by the
.B @PACKAGE@
package:
.TP
.BR inet (4)
OpenSS7 INET
.I STREAMS
driver.
The
.BR inet (4)
driver provides the first generation approach to INET
.I STREAMS
drivers: it uses an in-kernel
.I STREAMS
over
.I Sockets
approach.
.TP
.BR rawip (4)
Raw Internet Protocol
.I STREAMS
driver.
The
.BR rawip (4)
dirver provides a second generation raw IP driver that is implemented entirely
using
.IR STREAMS .
.TP
.BR tcp (4)
Transmission Control Protocol
.I STREAMS
driver.
The
.BR tcp (4)
dirver provides a second generation TCP driver that will be implemented entirely
using
.IR STREAMS .
.TP
.BR udp (4)
User Datagram Protocol
.I STREAMS
driver.
The
.BR udp (4)
dirver provides a second generation UDP driver that is implemented entirely
using
.IR STREAMS .
.PD
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package includes kernel modules,
.I SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
.I STREAMS
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and
development environment for the development and execution of
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
protocol stack components and applications for the
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
environment.
.PP
This distribution is only currently applicable to
.B Linux
2.4 and 2.6 kernels and was targeted at
.IR ix86 ", " x86_64 ", " ppc " and " ppc64
architectures, but should build and install for other architectures as well.
.PP
This package is complete and has been in production use for
.I Linux Fast-STREAMS
for a number of years.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.I Production
releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project
and validated on specific distributions and architectures.
.I Production
release packages do not ship with known defects.  Please rememaber that there
is
.B NO WARRANTY
on public release packages.
.PP
.I Production
packages ship containing a list of validated distributions and architectures.
Full regression testing of any maintenance changes is performed.  Suitability
of software in this category for production use on the specified target
distributions and architectures is at the discretion of the user.  It should
not be necessary to perform validation tests on the set of supported target
systems before considering production use.
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
could possibly contain unknown defects.  This is a
.I production
release.  Nevertheless, some remaining unknown defects could possibly be
harmful.  Validation testing has been performed by the
.I OpenSS7 Project
and external entities on this software for the set of systems listed in the
release notes.  Nevertheless, the software might still fail to configure or
compile on other systems.  The
.I OpenSS7 Project
recommends that you validate this software for your target system before using
this software.  Use at your own risk.  Remember that there is
.BR "NO WARRANTY" .
(See the section
.RI \(lq "NO WARRANTY" \(rq
under the
.RI \(lq "GNU General Public License" \(rq,
in the manual.)
.PP
This software is
.I production
software.  As such, it is stable on validated systems but might still crash
your kernel in unique circumstances.  Installation of the software on a
non-validated distribution might mangle your header files or Linux
distribution in such a way as to make it unusable and rebooting the system
might not repair the problem.  You possibly lose all the data on your system.
Because this software stands a chance of crashing your kernel, the resulting
unstable system could possibly destroy computer hardware or peripherals making
them unusable.  You might void the warranty on any system on which you run
this software.
.B YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

.SH BUGS
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE@
package has been tested with a wide array of production
.B Linux
distributions, kernels, and target architectures, and is considered production grade by
.IR "The OpenSS7 Project" .
At the time of release, the
.B @PACKAGE@
package had no known bugs.  Problems can be reported to
.RB < bugs@openss7.org >.
Please, however, use the included
.B send-pr
script for generating actionable problem reports.
Please see the file
.RI \(lq PROBLEMS \(rq
in the release for problem reporting guidelines.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The

package is compatible with

and systems based on
.I SVR 4.2
such as
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:

provides compatibility with all implementations of the Internet Protocol suite
using the Transport Provider Interface Revision 1.5 or 2.0.0
specifications.
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.IP \(em
These drivers are designed to operate with the XTI/TLI library implementation
provided by the
.BR strxnet (5)
package and is thus compatible with most XTI library implementations as well.

.SH CONFORMANCE

.IR TPI ,
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.IR "XNS 5.2" ,

.IR UNIX95 .
Conformance is tested using the
.BR test-inet_raw (8),
.BR test-inet_tcp "(8), and "
.BR test-inet_udp (8),
test case executables and the
.I @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.B autotest
test suite.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package originally
contained the XTI/TLI library and
.BR timod (4)
and
.BR tirdwr (4)
modules.
The library and the
.BR timod (4)
and
.BR tirdwr (4)
modules were split from the
.BR strinet (5)
package and placed in their own
.BR strxnet (5)
package.  NSL library and Socket library functions were added to the
.BR strxnet (5)
package initially, but subsequently split to separate
.BR strsock (5)
and
.BR strnsl (5)
packages.
What remains in the
.BR strinet (5)
package is the header files, and
.I STREAMS
drivers, also TPI interface header files and documentation.
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is a stable, production grade release.
.\"
.\"
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
.PP
The INET package is a stable production release and is largely in
maintenance mode.  There are, nevertheless, several items remaining to be
done.  See the
.RI \(lq TODO \(rq
file in the release for detailed information on further development.
