The members of the

The type of WAN structure: always \fB\)WAN_PLAIN\fP.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B wan_hdioc
structure is used to provider subnetwork (link) identifier and related
information for use with the
.BR W_ENABLE "(7) and " W_DISABLE (7)
input-output contol commands from the
.IR "Wide Area Network (WAN)" ,
.[
wan revision @PACKAGE_VERSION@ draft @PACKAGE_RELEASE@
.]
.BR wan (7).
.PP
The
.B wan_hdioc
structure, and the corresponding input-output controls, are used primarily by
the
.BR linkstart "(8) and " linkstop (8)
utilities,
but may be used directly by user-space programs.
.PP
There is one shared structure that is used for WAN.
.PP
The members of the
.B wan_hdioc
structure are described as follows:
.TP
.I w_type
Specifies the type of the structure.  For the
.B wan_hdioc
structure, this member is always set to
.BR WAN_PLAIN .
.TP
.I w_spare
Spare bytes for alignment.  These bytes are coded zero (0) by the initiator
and ignored by the responder.
.TP
.I w_snid
The subnetwork (link) ID.

.SH BUGS

structure has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B wan_hdioc
structure is compatible with
.IR "SpiderX25" ,
.[
spiderx25
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SpiderX25" ,
such as
.IR "AIXlink/X.25" ,
.[

.IR "HP-UX" ,

.IR "SBE X.25" ,
.[
sbex25
.]
.IR "RadiSys WAN" ,

with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
is not directly compatible with
.IR "Solstice 9.2" ,
.[
solx25dg
.]
in that this data structure is described as:
.RS
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
struct wan_hdioc {
    uint8_t w_type;      /* Table type = WAN_PLAIN */
    uint8_t w_class[3];  /* spare bytes for alignment */
    uint32_t w_ppa;      /* PPA/Subnetwork ID character */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP
.I w_type
The table type.  This should always be \fB\)WAN_PLAIN\fP.
.PD 0
.TP
.I w_spare
Spare bytes for alignment.
.TP
.I w_ppa
The PPA identifier.
.PD
.PP
Of course, the member \fI\)w_snid\fP is always called \fI\)w_ppa\fP.
This does not directly cause source compatibility issues, just binary
compatibility issues.
.RE
.IP \(em
.IR "Solstice 9.2" ,
.[
solx25dg
.]
specifies that the
.B wan_hdioc
structure is used for the
.BR W_ZEROSTATS (7)
input-output control.  Note that
.IR "Solstice 9.2"
.[
solx25dg
.]
does not specify the
.BR W_ENABLE "(7) nor " W_DISABLE
input-output control commands.

.BR STREAMS (9).
