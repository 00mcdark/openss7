.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B labptune
structure is used to provide LAPB configuration and tuning parameters for use
with the
.BR L_GETTUNE "(7) and " L_SETTUNE (7)
input-output control commands from the
.IR "Logical Link Interface (LLI)" ,
.BR lli (7).
.[
lli revision @PACKAGE_VERSION@ draft @PACKAGE_RELEASE@
.]
.PP
The
.B llc2tune
structure, and the corresponding input-output controls, are used primarily by
the
.BR lltune (8)
utility,
but may be used directly by user-space programs.
.PP
There are separate structures for MLP,
.BR mlptune (5),
and
LLC2,
.BR llc2tune (5).
.\"
.PP
The members of the
.B llc2tune
structure are described as follows:
.TP \w'\ \fIsabm_in_x32\fR\(em'u
.I N2
The maximum number of times that a protocol data unit (PDU) is sent following
the expiry of the acknowledgement timer, the P-bit timer, or the reject
timer.  It also limits the number of times an RR with the P-bit set is sent
when remote busy is true and the busy timer expires.
.TP
.I T1
The time during which the LAPB expects to receive an acknowledgement to an
outstanding I-PDU or an expected response to a sent UI-PDU.  The value is in
units of 0.1 seconds.
.TP
.I Tpf
The time during which the LAPB expects to receive a PDU with the F-bit set to
1 in response to a command with the P-bit set to 1.  The value should be less
than the acknowledgement timer.  The value is in units of 0.1 seconds.
.TP
.I Trej
The time during which the LAPB expects to receive a reply to a sent REJ PDU.
The value is in units of 0.1 seconds.
.TP
.I Tbusy
The time during which the LAPB waits for an indication of the clearance of
busy condition at the other LAPB.  The value is in units of 0.1 seconds.
.TP
.I Tidle
The time during which the LAPB expects to receive a PDU from the other LAPB.
If it expires then the P/F cycle is initiated which may result in link
disconnection.  The value is in units of 0.1 seconds.
.TP
.I ack_delay
The maximum delay in 0.1 second units before transmitting a delayed RR.  This
must be considerably less than the acknowledgement timer value.
.TP
.I notack_max
The maximum number of unacknowledged receive I PDUs before the RR
acknowledging them all must be sent.
.TP
.I tx_window
The number of unacknowledged I PDUs which may be sent.
.TP
.I tx_probe
The potion before the window is closed at which an I PDU is sent with the
P-bit set to solicit an acknowledgement from the receiver.
.TP
.I max_I_len
The maximum size of a LAPB I-frame.  LAPB requires all incoming I-frames
above a certain size to be rejected by a FRMR.  This parameter specifies the
maximum size.  It is constructed as (maximum X.25 data size + X.25 protocol
length + LAPB protocol length).
.TP
.I xid_window
The XID window size (receive window), when the remote window size is unknown
or zero.
.TP
.I xid_Ndup
The duplicate MAC XID count (0 means no test).
.TP
.I xid_Tdup
The duplicate MAC XID time.  The value is in units of 0.1 seconds.

.SH BUGS

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B llc2tune
structure is compatible with
.IR "Spider X.25" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "Spider X.25" ,
such as
.IR "AIXlink/X.25" ,
.[
aixx25
.]
.IR "HP-UX" ,
.[
hpuxdoc
.]
.IR "IRIS SX.25" ,
.[

.IR "Solstice X.25" ,
.[
solx25ag
.]
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
.IR "SBE X.25" ,
.[
sbex25
.]
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "PT X.25"
.[
ptx25
.]
does not support LLC2.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supports LLC2 in support of XOL and porting applications from
.IR "AIXlink/X.25" ,
.IR "Solstice X.25" ,
.IR "HP-UX" \(rq,
.IR "IRIS SX.25" ,
.IR "VxWorks" ,
.IR "pSOS" ,
.IR "SpiderX.25" ,
and many other implementations based on
.IR SpiderX.25"
support LLC2.  Portable X.25 and XOL applications will use
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
instead of
.IR "PT X.25" .
