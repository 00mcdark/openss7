.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Wide Area Network (WAN) interface is a proprietary interface without a
formal standard.  Either the Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.[
cdi revision @PACKAGE_VERSION@ draft @PACKAGE_RELEASE@
.]
.BR cdi (7),
or the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
should be used in its stead.

.SH SEE ALSO

.IR STREAMS (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B wan_mpioc
structure is compatible with WAN, and implementations based on WAN such as
.BR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.BR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.BR "HP-UX X.25/9000" ,
.BR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
WAN is an inherently low level and non-portable interface and should not be
used by portable programs.  Portable programs should use the CDI or DLPI
interfaces in its stead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted: only a rough source compatibility.  Any
binary compatibility exhibited is a bug and is scheduled to be removed in the
next release.
.PP
See
.BR WAN (7),
.IR STREAMS (4),
for additional compatiblity considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The WAN is not a formal standard.  The
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implementation of WAN conforms to documentation for Version 3 of the WAN.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
The WAN is an interface originally developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now a
division of Emmerson Power).  The WAN interface found its way into may
mainstream UNIX implementations and UNIX-like RTOS sporting STREAMS such as
Windriver's VxWorks.  The WAN was never standardized and remains an inherently
non-portable interface.
