.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B A_RELEASE_RSP
primtiive is used in conjunction with
.BR ap_snd (3)
and the XAP Library environment to respond to an association release request.
.PP
Refer to the table in the manual page description for
.BR ap_snd (3)
for more information concerning the effects of sending the
.B A_RELEASE_RSP
primitive and restrictions on its use.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
To send the
.B A_RELEASE_RSP
primitive, the arguments to
.BR ap_snd (3)
must be set as described below:
.TP \w'\fIaperrno_p\fP\(em'u
.I fd
This argument identifies the XAP Library instance being used.
.TP
.I sptype
This argument must be set to
.BR AP_A_RELEASE_RSP .
.TP
.I cdata
The following members of
.I cdata
are used for this primitive:
.RS
.RS 4
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
long udata_length;  /* length of user-information */
long res;           /* result                     */
long rsn;           /* reason for the result      */
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Where this primitive is to be sent using a series of calls to
.BR ap_snd (3)
with the
.B AP_MORE
flag set,
.I cdata->udata_length
should be set to the total number of octets of encoded user data that will be sent with this
primitive.  If the total number of octets of encoded user data is not known this field may be set to
minus one
.RB ( -1 ).
However, in some XAP implementations setting this field to minus one
.RB ( -1 )
may significantly degrade performance as it requires the implementation to buffer data until a
complete SPDU can be transmitted.
.PP
The total number of octets of encoded user data that can be sent with this primitive may be subject
to an implementation dependent resetriction.  Any such restriction will be stated in the CSQ for an
implementation.
.PP
The argument,
.I cdata->res
is used to indicate whether the release request is accepted or rejected.  Legal values for
.I cdata->res
are as follows:
.TP \w'\fBAP_REL_NOTFINISHED\fP\(em'u
.B AP_REL_AFFIRM
Indicates acceptance of the release.
.PD 0
.TP
.B AP_REL_NEGATIVE
Indicates rejection of the release.  Note that this value can only be usedif the Session negotiated
release function unit has been negotiated.
.PD
.PP
The argument,
.I cdata->rsn
must be one of the following:
.TP \w'\fBAP_REL_NOTFINISHED\fP\(em'u
.B AP_REL_NORMAL
Indicates a normal release.
.PD 0
.TP
.B AP_REL_NOTFINISHED
Indicates the user is not finished with the association.
.TP
.B AP_REL_USER_DEF
Indicates a user defined reason.
.TP
.B AP_RSN_NOVAL
No value was supplied for this optional parameter.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.I ubuf
Use of the
.I ubuf
argument is described in the manual page for
.BR ap_snd (3).
.TP
.I flags
The
.I flags
argument is used to control certain aspects of primitive processing as described in the manual page
for
.BR ap_snd (3).
.TP
.I aperrno_p
This must point to a location which will be set to an error code if a failure occurs.

.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
This primitive is originated by the XAP interface client.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
.PP
This primitive is valid in states
.BR AP_WRELrsp_RELind
or
.BR AP_WRELrsp_RELind_init .
.PP
When the current state is
.BR AP_WRELrsp_RELind ,
the next state may be
.BR AP_IDLE " or " AP_DATA_XFER .
When the current state is
.BR AP_WRELrsp_RELind_init ,
the next state is
