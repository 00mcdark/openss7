.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the destination NS user that a network connect
request has been made by the user at the specified source address.
.PP
The specification of NS user data is optional.  The NS user can send any
integral number of octets of data within the range supported by the NS
provider.  The NS user data will only be present if the corresponding
.BR N_EXT_CONN_REQ (7)
had NS user data parameter specified, and their data will be identical.
.PP
Note that this primitive will not be issued by the NS provider unless requested
in the
.BR N_EXT_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.
.\"
.TP
.I DEST_length
Indicates the length of the destination address parameter that conveys an
address identifying the NS user to which the NC is to be established.
.\"
.TP
.I DEST_offset
Is the offset of the destination address from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block.
.\"
.TP
.I SRC_length
The source address parameter conveys the network address ofthe NS user from
which the NC has been requested.  The semantics of the value in the
.BR N_EXT2_CONN_IND
primitive isidentical to the value associated with the stream on which the
.BR N_EXT_CONN_REQ (7)
was issued.
.\"
.TP
.I SRC_offset
Is the offset of the destination address from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block.
.\"
.TP
.I SEQ_number
Identifies the sequence number that can be used by the NS userto associate
this message with the
.BR N_EXT_CONN_RES (7)
or
.BR N_DISCON_REQ (7)
primitive that is to follow.  This value must be unique among the outstanding
.B N_EXT2_CONN_IND
messages.  The use of this field allows the NS user to issue the
.BR N_EXT_CONN_RES (7)
or the
.BR N_DISCON_REQ (7)
messages in any order.
.\"
.TP
.I CONN_flags
Indicates the connection flags that can be a bitwise OR of any of the
following values:
.RS
.\"
.TP
.B REC_CONF_OPT
The receipt confirmation selection parameter indicates the use/availability of
the receipt confirmation service on the NC.  The receiptconfirmation service
must be provided in the network service to be used on the NC.
.\"
.TP
.B EX_DATA_OPT
The expedited data selection parameter indicates the use/availability of the
expedited data transfer service on the NC.  The expedited data transfer service
must be provided by the NS provider for it to be used on the NC.
.RE
.\"
.TP
.I QOS_length
Indicates the length of the QOS parameters values that are negotiated during NC
establishment.  If the destination NS user does not agree to the range of QOS
values specified by the source NS user in the
.BR N_EXT_CONN_REQ (7)
primitive, it will reject the NC establishment by invoking a
.BR N_DISCON_REQ (7)
primitive (the originator parameter in the
.BR N_DISCON_REQ (7)
primitive will indicate NS user initiated release).  If the NS user does
not support or cannot determine the value of a QOS parameter, its value will
be set to
.BR QOS_UNKNOWN .
If the NS user does not specify any QOS parameter values, the length of this
field should be set to zero.
.\"
.TP
.I QOS_offset
Indicates the offset of the QOS parameters from the beginningof the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block.
.\"
.TP
.I FAC_length
Indicates the length of the binary X.25 facilties that apply to the NC being
requested.  If the NS user does not specify any binary X.25 facilities, the
length in this field should be set to zero.
.\"
.TP
.I FAC_offset
Indicates the offset of the binary X.25 facilities from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block.
.\"
.TP
.I LPA_number
Indicates the number of the lower physical appearance on which the incoming call
was received.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in the states
.B NS_IDLE
and
.BR NS_WRES_CIND .
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
In both cases the resulting state is
.B NS_WRES_CIND
(the number of connect indications waiting for user response is incremented by
one).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B N_EXT2_CONN_IND
is a
.IR GCOM -specific
primitive.  It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.B _GCOM_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/npi.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.  Also, it might be necessary to include the
.RB < sys/npiext.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B N_EXT2_CONN_IND
is compatible with
.IR GCOM ,
.[
npiapi
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B N_EXT2_CONN_IND
is a
.IR GCOM -specific
primitive that is not part of the NPI standard.
.[
npi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
It should not be used by portable NPI programs.
.IP \(em
.B N_EXT2_CONN_IND
is provided by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
for source compatibility with NS providers and user written to use with
.IR GCOM ,
.[
npiapi
.]
and for porting NS providers and users from
.I GCOM
to
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
Binary compatibilty is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced may
be removed from the next release.
.PP
See
.IR STREAMS (9)
and
.BR npi (7),
