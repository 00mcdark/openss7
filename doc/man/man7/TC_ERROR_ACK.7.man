.TH TC_ERROR_ACK 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Transaction Component Interface (TCI)"
.SH NAME
.PP
.B TC_ERROR_ACK
\- Error Acknowledgment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of a
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TC_error_ack {
    ulong PRIM_type;
    ulong ERROR_prim;
    ulong TCI_error;
    ulong UNIX_error;
    ulong DIALOG_id;
    ulong INVOKE_id;
} TC_error_ack_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the TC user that a non-fatal error has occurred in the last
TC-user-originated primitive.
.PP
For an overview of the error handling capabilities available to the TC provider see
.BR tci (7).
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive.
Always
.BR TC_ERROR_ACK .
.TP
.I ERROR_prim
identifies the primitive type that caused the error
.TP
.I TCI_error
contains the Transaction Component Interface error code.
.TP
.I UNIX_error
contains the Linux system error code.
This may only be non zero if
.I TCI_error
is equal to
.BR TCSYSERR .
.TP
.I DIALOG_id
is the dialogue identifier for the dialogue upon which the primitive caused an error.
.TP
.I INVOKE_id
is the invoke identifier for the operation for which the primtiive cuase and error.
.SH RULES
.PP
This may only be initiated as an acknowledgment for those primitives that require one.
It also indicates to the TC user that no action was taken on the primitive that caused the error.
