.TH CD_BAD_FRAME_IND 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Communications Device Interface (CDI)"
.SH NAME
.B CD_BAD_FRAME_IND
\- frame with error
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks.
The
.BR M_PROTO (9)
block is structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
    cd_ulong cd_state;
    cd_ulong cd_error;          /* what is wrong with the frame 
                                 */
} cd_bad_frame_ind_t;

/* Error types for CD_BAD_FRAME_IND */
#define CD_FRMTOOLONG   0xFFFF  /* frame overflowed rcv bfr */
#define CD_FRMNONOCTET  0xFFFE  /* frame not octet-aligned */
#define CD_EMPTY_BFR    0xFFFD  /* empty rcv buffer (not used) */
#define CD_BAD_CRC      0xFFFC  /* CRC error */
#define CD_FRM_ABORTED  0xFFFB  /* frame aborted */
#define CD_RCV_OVERRUN  0xFFFA  /* receive overrun */

.SH DESCRIPTION
This provider originated primitives indicates that a frame was received in
error.  The error is indicated along with any data that is retrievable from
frame received in error.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Indicates the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_state
.RS
.TP
.B CD_UNATTACHED
No PPA attached.
.TP
.B CD_UNUSABLE
PPA cannot be used.
.TP
.B CD_DISABLED
PPA attached.
.TP
.B CD_ENABLE_PENDING
Waiting ack of enable req.
.TP
.B CD_ENABLED
Awaiting use.
.TP
.B CD_READ_ACTIVE
Input section enabled; disabled after data arrives.
.TP
.B CD_INPUT_ALLOWED
Input section permanently enabled.
.TP
.B CD_DISABLE_PENDING
Waiting ack of disable req.
.TP
.B CD_OUTPUT_ACTIVE
Output section active only.
.TP
.B CD_XRAY
Xray-ing another ppa.
.RE
.TP
.I cd_error
Indicates the error encountered on the frame.  Amoung other values defined for
a particular device, this error can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_FRMTOOLONG
The frame was too long; it overflowed the receive buffer.  The data that was
successfully received is in the
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks associated with the primitive.
.TP
.B CD_FRMNONOCTET
The frame was not octet-align.  This is a residue error.
The data that was successfully received (not including the residue error bits)
is in the
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks associated with the primitive.
.TP
.B CD_EMPTY_BFR
The receive buffer is empty.  This error is not normally used.
No
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks are included with this error.
.TP
.B CD_BAD_CRC
There was a CRC error in an otherwise correctly received frame.
The data that was successfully received, but which failed CRC calculation,
is in the
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks associated with the primitive.
.TP
.B CD_FRM_ABORTED
The frame was aborted.
Any successfully received octets at the time of the abort are included in the
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks associated with the primitive.
.TP
.B CD_RCV_OVERRUN
There was a receiver overrun in during the reception of the frame.
Any successfully received octets up to the point of the receiver overrun are
included in the
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks associated with the primitive.
.RE
.SS State
After issuing this primitive, the state remains unchanged.
