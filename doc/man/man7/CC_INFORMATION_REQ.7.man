The format of this message is on
.B M_PROTO
message block.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_information_req {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_INFORMATION_REQ */
    ulong cc_user_ref;          /* call reference */

    ulong cc_subn_offset;       /* subsequent number offset */
    ulong cc_opt_length;        /* optional parameter length */

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This message request that the CCS provider include the subsequent number
information in addition to the called party number information previously
supplied with a
.BR CC_SETUP_REQ (7)
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_INFORMATION_REQ .
.TP
.I cc_user_ref
Specifies the user call reference.  It is used by the CCS user to associate
the message with an outstanding
.BR CC_SETUP_REQ (7)
message.
.TP
.I cc_subn_length
Specifies the length of the subsequent called party address parameter that
conveys more of an address identifying the CCS user to which the call is to be
established.  This field will accommodate variable length addresses within a
range supported by the CCS provider.  If no subsequent called party address is
provided by the CCS user, this field must be coded to zero.  The coding of the
subsequent called party address is protocol and provider-specific.
.TP
.I cc_subn_offset
Is the offset of the subsequent called party address from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.TP
.I cc_opt_length
Specifies the length of the optional parameters associated with the alerting
indication.
.TP
.I cc_opt_offset
Specifies the offset of the optional parameters from the start of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is valid in state
.BR CCS_WIND_MORE " and " CCS_WREQ_INFO .
The new state is
.B CCS_WIND_MORE
if the subsequent number still does not contain complete address information or
.B CCS_WIND_PROCEED
if it does.
.\"
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is valid in UNI (both User and Network) and NNI.
.\"
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is originated by the CC User.
.\"
.\"
.SH ACKNOWLEDGMENT
.PP
The CCS provider should generate one of the following acknowledgments upon receipt of this primitive:
.HP
.IR Successful :
Successful completion is indicated via the
.BR CC_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.
.HP
.IR "Unsuccessful (Non-fatal errors)" :
Errors are indicated via the
.BR CC_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The applicable non-fatal errors are defined as follows:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.RB [ CCNOADDR ]
The user did not provide a subsequent called party address field and one was
required by the call type.  The CCS provider could not select a called party
address.
.TP
.RB [ CCSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the UNIX system eror is indicated in the
.BR CC_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.TP
.RB [ CCOUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADCLR ]
The specified call reference was invalid.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADADDR ]
The subsequent called party address was in the incorrect format, or contained
illegal information.  This is used only to handle coding errors of the address
and is not intended to provide for protocol errors.  Protocol errors should be
conveyed in the
.BR CC_CALL_FAILURE_IND " or " CC_RELEASE_IND
primitives.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADOPT ]
The optional parameters were in an incorrect format, or contained illegal
information.
.TP
.RB [ CCACCESS ]
The user did not have proper permissions for the use of the requested address
or options.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADPRIM ]
The primitive is of an incorrect format or an offset exceeds the size of the
.B M_PROTO
block.
