.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Disconnect Request or Indication message primitive, \fBN_DI\fP, is used
by the NS user to reject an incoming connection or disconnect an existing
connection, or by the NS provider to reject an outgoing connection or disconnect
an existing connection.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block, and
contains the \fBxdiscf\fP structure.
The data part of the message consists of zero or one
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks
containing the Clear User Data (CUD) when supplied.
.PP
The X.25 cause and diagnostic octets, \fIcause\fP and \fIdiag\fP, are
presented, as well as the CONS \fIoriginator\fP and \fIreason\fP codes
mapped from the X.25 cause and diagnostic.  A Disconnect Request for a non-CONS
call can specify a non-zero \fIcause\fP code.  This has no effect for a CONS
call.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The Disconnect Request and Disconnect Indication use the
.B xdiscf
structure.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block
containing the
.B xdiscf
structure.
The data part of the message consists of zero or one
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks
containing the Clear User Data (if any).
.\"

_
.TE
.RE
.TP
.I cause
Conveys the X.25 cause octet associated with the disconnect.
.TP
.I diag
Conveys the X.25 diagnostic octet associated with the disconnect.
.TP
.I conn_id
When a Disconnect Request is used to refuse and incoming connection, this field
contains the \fIconn_id\fP from the corresponding Connect Indication message
primitive.
.TP
.I indicated_qos
When non-zero, conveys that facilities and quality of service paraemters are
being indicated.
.TP
.I responder
Conveys the responding address.  This is the local responding address in a
Disconnect Request used to refuse an incoming call, and a remote
responding address in a Disconnect Indication refusing an outgoing call.
.TP
.I deflected
When the \fIcall_deflect\fP field of the associated \fIqos\fP structure is
non-zero, this field conveys the deflected address.  The deflected address is
the address of the remote station to which the call is being deflected.  This is
set by the NS user when deflecting a call with a Disconnect Request refusing an
incoming connection; and by the NS provider when an outgoing call has been
deflected.
.TP
.I qos
Conveys the CONS quality of service parameters and non-OSI facilities associated
with the disconnect.  This is used currently for the charging information when
an existing connection is disconnected, and for the deflection facility when an
incoming or outgoing call is being deflected.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
.PP
This primitive is valid in the data transfer phase; it is also valid in the
incoming or outgoing connecting phase.  The call moves to the disconnect phase.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
This primitive is valid in response to a previously sent Connect Request or
received Connect Indication message primitive; or, to simply request or indicate
disconnection of an existing connection.
.PP
When an existing connection is disconnect with a Disconnect Request by the NS
user, the NS user expects a Disconnect Confirmation to acknowledge the
disconnect.  All other message should be discarded from the Stream until the
Disconnect Confirmation is received.
.PP
When a Disconnect Indication is issued by the NS provider, all messages sent
downstream except Connect Request or Connect Response messages are silently
discarded.
.PP
A disconnect collision can occur, where Disconnect Request and a Disconnect
Indication messages collide.  In this case, the Disconnect Indication messages
is taken as a confirmation and no Disconnect Confirmation message should be
expected by the NS user.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The Disconnect Request message primitive is equivalent to the
.BR N_DISCON_REQ (7)
primitive of the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
.BR npi (7);
the Disconnect Indication,
.BR N_DISCON_IND (7).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Network Layer Interface (NLI) is a proprietary interface without a formal
standard.  Either the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
.BR npi (7),
or the XTI-X25 interface,
.[
xx25
.]
.BR xti_x25 (3),
should be used in its stead.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B N_DI
is compatible with NLI, and implementations based on NLI such as
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "HP-UX X.25/9000" ,
.IR "PT X.25" ,

ptx25

with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
are consistent in their documentation of
.BR N_DI .
.IP \(em
NLI is an inherently low level and non-portable interface and should not be
used by portable programs.  Portable programs should use the NPI or XX25
interfaces in its stead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted: only a rough source compatibility.  Any
binary compatibility exhibited is a bug and is scheduled to be removed in the
next release.
.PP
See
.BR NLI (7),
.IR STREAMS (4),
for additional compatiblity considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The NLI is not a formal standard.  The
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implementation of NLI conforms to documentation for Version 3 of the NLI.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The NLI is an interface originally developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now a
division of Emmerson Power).  The NLI interface found its way into may
mainstream UNIX implementations and UNIX-like RTOS sporting STREAMS such as
Windriver's VxWorks.  The NLI was never standardized and remains an inherently
non-portable interface.
