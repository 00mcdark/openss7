.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an implementation of the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) Message Transfer
Part (MTP) defined in Q.704 and ANSI T1.111.4.
.Nm
provides reliable sequenced or unsequenced delivery of packets over a
connectionless transport between two
.Nm
stream.
.Nm
provides strong assurances that the data arrives in order on a stream, if
requested, and maintains sequencing of packets in the face of most network
failures.  It generates and checks a per-packet checksum to catch transmission
errors.
.Pp
.Nm
provides the following stream types:

.\"This is a stream supportingn the NPI interface.  See
