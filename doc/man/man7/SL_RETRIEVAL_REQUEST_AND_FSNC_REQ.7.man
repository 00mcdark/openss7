.SH NAME
.B SL_RETREIVAL_REQUEST_AND_FSNC_REQ, sl_retrieval_req_and_fsnc_t
\- retrieval request and FSNC request primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The retrieval request and FSNC request service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
    sl_ulong sl_fsnc;
} sl_retrieval_req_and_fsnc_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The retrieval request and FSNC request service primitive is originated by the
SLS user when it wishes to update the retransmission buffer with the last known
acknowledged message (FSNC).  The last known acknowledged message is acquired
by the SLS user with the sequence changeover procedure of the message transfer
part.  The primitive requests that the SLS provider update the retransmission
buffer and then deliver the contents of the updated retransmission buffer and
transmit buffers to the SLS user.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The retrieval request and FSNC request service primitive contains the following
parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Specifies the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_RETRIEVAL_REQUEST_AND_FSNC_REQ .
.TP
.I sl_fsnc
Specifies the value of the FSNC (forward sequence number confirmed).  This is
the last known message to be acknowledge by the remote SLS provider.  The
format of the FSNC is provider-specific, but is typically a 7-bit or 12-bit
sequence number.
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only valid in management state
.B LMI_ENABLED
and is valid in
link state
.BR SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE .
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new state remains unchanged.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS User.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
The retrieval request and FSNC request service primitive request the SLS
provider to acknowledge the result of the retrieval action as follows:
.IP \(en \w'\(en\(em'u
.B Successful retrieval:
When successful, the SLS provider indicates the updated contents of the
retransmission buffer and the contents of the transmission buffer using the
.BR SL_RETRIEVED_MESSAGE_IND (7)
primitive followed by a
.BR SL_RETRIEVAL_COMPLETE_IND (7)
primitive.  The state remains unchanged.
.IP \(en
.B Unsuccessful retrieval:
When unsuccessful, the SLS provider indicates failure to retrieve the contents
of the buffers with the
.BR SL_RETRIEVAL_NOT_POSSIBLE_IND (7)
primitive.
.IP \(en
.B Non-fatal errors:
When a non-fatal error occurs, the SLS provider indicates the error using the
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive containing the error and the reason.  The state remains unchanged.
.PP
When the management stat is
.B LMI_ENABLED
and the link state is other than
.BR SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE ,
the SLS provider should respond with
.BR SL_RETRIEVAL_NOT_POSSIBLE_IND (7)
instead of generating a non-fatal error.
.\"
.SS Errors
.PP
Most SLS providers are always successful in retrieving the updated contents of
the retransmission buffer and transmission buffer.  Applicable reasons for
failing to retrieve the updated buffer contents are as follows:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
Hardware failure.
.IP 2.
The signalling link is in the incorrect link state (e.g. the in-service
state).
.IP 3.
The specified value of FSNC does not match and is not adjacent to a message
contained in the retransmission buffer.
.PP
.B Non-Fatal Errors:
applicable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.TP \w'\fBLMI_LAN_COLLISIONS\fR\(em'u
.B LMI_UNSPEC
Unknown or unspecified.
.PD 0
.TP
.B LMI_DISC
Disconnected.
.TP
.B LMI_EVENT
Protocol-specific event occurred.
.TP
.B LMI_FATALERR
Device has become unusable.
.TP
.B LMI_OUTSTATE
Primitive was issued from invalid state.
.TP
.B LMI_PROTOSHORT
.BR M_PROTO (9)
block too short.
.TP
.B LMI_SYSERR
UNIX system error.
.TP
.B LMI_DEVERR
Start of device-specific error codes.
