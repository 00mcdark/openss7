.SH NAME
.PP
.B TC_CANCEL_REQ
\- Operation Cancellation Request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TC_cancel_req {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TC_CANCEL_REQ */
    ulong DIALOG_id;          /* Dialog Identifier */
    ulong INVOKE_id;          /* Invoke identifier */
} TC_cancel_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive cancels an operation.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
is the primitive type.
Always
.BR TC_CANCEL_REQ .
.TP
.I DIALOG_id
is the dialogue identifier to which the component will belong.
This must be the same as the
.I DIALOG_id
from the corresponding
.BR TC_INVOKE_REQ
primitive.
.TP
.I INVOKE_id
is the TC user assigned invocation identifier for this operation.
This must be the same as the
.I INVOKE_id
from the corresponding
.BR TC_INVOKE_REQ
primitive.
.SH RULES
.PP
The
.I DIALOG_id
and
.I INVOKE_id
is used by the TC provider to correlate the cancellation to the invocation.
The
.I DIALOG_id
and
.I INVOKE_id
must be the same as those from the corresponding
.BR TC_INVOKE_REQ (7)
primitive.
.PP
Component handling request primitives are issued before the corresponding Dialogue handling
primitives that transmit the accumulated components.  See
.BR tci (7)
for more detail.
.PP
This primitive does not require any acknowledgement.
If a non-fatal error occurs, it is the responsibility of the TC provider to report it using the
.BR TR_ERROR_ACK (7),
.BR TR_NOTICE_IND (7),
or
.BR TR_ABORT_IND (7)
primitives.
Fatal errors are indicated using a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message type which results in the failure of all operating system service routines on the
.IR stream .
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The allowable fatal errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.BR "" [ EPROTO ]
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
.RS
.IP \- 3
The transaction component interface was found to be in an incorrect state.
.RE
.SH MODES
.PP
Operation class 1 or 2.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
TC user.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B <ss7/tc.h>
\- the transaction component interface header file.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR tci (7),
.BR M_PROTO (9),
.BR TC_CANCEL_IND (7),
.BR TC_INVOKE_REQ (7),
.BR TC_ERROR_ACK (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transaction Component Interface first appeared in OpenSS7.
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
This interface conforms to TCI Revision 0.9.2, Draft 1.
