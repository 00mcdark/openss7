.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_BEGIN_IND
\- Association Begin Indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks if any user data is associated with the primitive.
The format of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TR_begin_ind {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_BEGIN_IND */
    ulong TRANS_id;           /* Transaction id */
    ulong ASSOC_flags;        /* Association flags */
    ulong DEST_length;        /* Destination address length */
    ulong DEST_offset;        /* Destination address offset */
    ulong ORIG_length;        /* Originating address length */
    ulong ORIG_offset;        /* Originating address offset */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* Options structure length */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* Options structure offset */
} TR_begin_ind_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the transaction user that an assocation begin request to the user has
been made by the user at the specified originating address.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
Always
.BR TR_BEGIN_IND .
.TP
.I TRANS_id
is the transaction identifier assigned by the transaction provider to this transaction association.
Transaction identifiers provided by the transaction provider always have the high bit set to 1 and
are different from -1.
The begin indication is always the first message to which the transaction provider attaches any
newly assigned transaction identifier.
.TP
.I ASSOC_flags
are the association options flags for the indication.
.TP
.I DEST_length
is the length of the destination address.
The destination address is indicated where it is different from the bound address associated with
the
.I stream
upon which the indication is issued, or when the
.I stream
is bound to more than one address (e.g. a list of application contexts) and the destination address
is more specific than the binding criteria and equivalent information is not contained in the
originating address.
.TP
.I DEST_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block) where the destination address begins.
.TP
.I ORIG_length
is the length of the originating address
.TP
.I ORIG_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block) where the originating address begins.
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the requested options associated with the primitive.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block) of the requested options associated with the primitive.
.PP
The proper alignment of the destination address, originating address, and options in the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is not guaranteed.
.SH MODES
.PP
Only connection-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
transaction provider.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
<ss7/tr.h>
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR TR_BEGIN_RES (7),
.BR TR_ABORT_REQ (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transaction Interface first appeared in OpenSS7.
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
This interface conforms to TRI Revision 0.9.2, Draft 1.
