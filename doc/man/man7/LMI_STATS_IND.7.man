.SH NAME
.B LMI_STATS_IND, lmi_stats_ind_t
\- statistics indication primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The statistics indication service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    lmi_long lmi_primitive;
    lmi_ulong lmi_interval;
    lmi_ulong lmi_timestamp;
} lmi_stats_ind_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
Following this structure within the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is the provider-specific statistics.
