.SS State
This primitive is valid in any state where a local acknowledgment is pending
in response to one of the following primitives:
.BR CD_ABORT_OUTPUT_REQ (7),
.BR CD_ALLOW_INPUT_REQ (7),
.BR CD_ATTACH_REQ (7),
.BR CD_DETACH_REQ (7),
.BR CD_DISABLE_REQ (7),
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7),
.BR CD_HALT_INPUT_REQ (7),
