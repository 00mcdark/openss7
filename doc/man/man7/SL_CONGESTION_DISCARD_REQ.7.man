.SH NAME
.B SL_CONGESTION_DISCARD_REQ, sl_cong_discard_req_t
\- congestion discard request primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The congestion discard request service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
} sl_cong_discard_req_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The congestion discard request service primitive is used by the SLS user to
specify receive congestion discard.
.PP
Normally an SLS user will first signal receive congestion onset with the
.BR SL_CONGESTION_ACCEPT_REQ (7)
primitive before signalling receive congestion discard with this
.BR SL_CONGESTION_DISCARD_REQ (7)
primitive.  The congestion discard service primitive requests that the SLS
provider discard all new undelivered message signal units and not acknowledge
them to the remote SLS provider.  The SLS provider will also generate receive
congestion indications to the remote SLS provider (i.e. will periodically
generate SIB).
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The congestion discard request service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Specifies the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_CONGESTION_DISCARD_REQ .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is valid only in
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state.  It is valid in
.B SL_STATE_IN_SERVICE
link state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The link and management state remains the same.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS User.
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The SLS user should observe the following rules when issuing the congestion
discard request service primitive:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The SLS user should not generate a congestion discard request unless a
congestion accept request was previously issued.
.IP \(em
The SLS user should not generate a congestion discard request unless a
congestion accept request was previously issued _and_ a message signal unit
has been delivered since the congestion accept request was issued.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
The congestion discard request service primitive does not require receipt
acknowledgement.
.IP \(en \w'\(en\(em'u
.B Successful:
When successful, this primitive does not require acknowledgement.  The state
remains the same.
.IP \(en
.B Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):
When unsuccessful, the SLS provider negatively acknowledges the primitive
using the
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive containing the error and reason.  The state remains the same.
.PP
Note that if the SLS provider is in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
state, but the link is not in the
.B SL_STATE_IN_SERVICE
state, the primitive should be ignored and no non-fatal error generated.
.\"
.SS Errors
.PP
.B Non-Fatal Errors:
applicable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.TP \w'\fBLMI_LAN_COLLISIONS\fR\(em'u
.B LMI_UNSPEC
Unknown or unspecified.
.PD 0
.TP
.B LMI_EVENT
Protocol-specific event occurred.
.TP
.B LMI_FATALERR
Device has become unusable.
.TP
.B LMI_OUTSTATE
Primitive was issued from invalid state.
.TP
.B LMI_PROTOSHORT
.BR M_PROTO (9)
block too short.
.TP
.B LMI_SYSERR
UNIX system error.
.TP
.B LMI_DEVERR
Start of device-specific error codes.
