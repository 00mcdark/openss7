.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_connect_ind {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_CONNECT_IND */
    ulong cc_call_ref;          /* call reference */
    ulong cc_flags;             /* connect flags */
    ulong cc_opt_length;        /* optional parameter length */
    ulong cc_opt_offset;        /* optional parameter offset */
} CC_connect_ind_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates that the called CCS user has connected to the call.
Upon receving this primitive the CCS user operating in UNI (Network) mode
should connect the calling CCS user to the call and acknowledge connection of
the calling CCS user by responding with the
.BR CC_SETUP_COMPLETE_REQ (7)
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_CONNECT_IND .
.TP
.I cc_call_ref
Indicates the call reference.  The call reference is used by the CCS provider
to identify the call.  The call reference is the same value which was
indicated in the corresponding
.BR CC_SETUP_CON (7)
primitive for the outgoing call.
.TP
.I cc_flags
Indicates the connect flags associated with the primitive.  Connect flags are
protocol specific (see Addendum).
.TP
.I cc_opt_length
Indicates the length of the optional parameters associated with the connect
indication.  If no optional parameters are associated with the connect
indication, then this parameter is coded zero by the CCS provider.
.TP
.I cc_opt_offset
Indicates the offset of the optional parameters from the start of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
