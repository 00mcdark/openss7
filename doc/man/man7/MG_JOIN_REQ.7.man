.TH MG_JOIN_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Media Gateway Interface (MGI)"
.SH NAME
.B MG_JOIN_REQ, MG_join_req, MG_join_req_t
\- join a communications session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This primitive is one
.B M_PROTO
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MG_join_req {
    ulong mg_primitive;         /* always MG_JOIN_REQ */
    ulong mg_se_id;             /* session to join (0 to create) */
    ulong mg_tp_id;             /* joined termination (0 for new) */
    ulong mg_channel_length;    /* channel ids that make up termination */
    ulong mg_channel_offset;    /* channel ids that make up termination */
} MG_join_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Requests that the specified channels be joined to the specified session with
newly created termination point with id specified by the caller
.RI ( mg_tp_id " non-zero)"
or assigned by the provider
.RI ( mg_tp_id " zero)."
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
This primitive has the following parameters:
.TP
.I mg_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR MG_JOIN_REQ .
.TP
.I mg_se_id
specifies the communications session to join or create.  When zero (0), it
specifies that the MG is to create a new communications session and return the
session id in the
.BR MG_JOIN_CON (7)
primitive.  When non-zero, and the communications session already exists, the
specified communications session will be joined.  When non-zero, and the
communications session does not exist, a communications session will be
created and assigned the specified id.
.TP
.I mg_tp_id
specifies the termination point within the communications session to join or
create.  WHen zero (0), it specifies that the MG is to pick an unused termination
point to the communications session and return the termination point id in the
.BR MG_JOIN_CON (7)
primitive.  When non-zero, and the termination point is not in use, the
sepcified termination point will be joined.
.TP
.I mg_channel_length
specifies the length of the channel identifiers that make up the termination
point.  This may be, for example, one channel identifier in a single channel
call, or multiple channel identifiers in a multi-rate call.
.TP
.I mg_channel_offset
specifies the offset, from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block, of the channel identifiers that make up the termination
point.
.SH RULES
.PP
.IP \(em 4
If the specified session id is zero then a new session will be created.
.IP \(em
If the specified session id exists, the existing session will be joined.
.IP \(em
If the specified session id is non-zero but does not exist, one will be
created with the specified id.
.IP \(em
If the specified termination point id is zero, then unused termination point
will be selected in the communications session.
.IP \(em
If the specified termination point id is non-zero, and unused in the
communications session, the session will be joined at the specified
termination point.
.IP \(em
All channels that make up the termination point must be successfully enabled
before this primitive will be confirmed.
.PP
Note that some termination points within some types of communications sessions
have special meaning.  For example, termination point (1) could be the
controllIng participant in a voice conference.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
.PP
.HP
.B Successful:
This primtive is confirmed with the
.BR MG_JOIN_CON (7)
primitive.
.HP
.B Unsuccessful:
It is refused with the
.BR MG_ERROR_ACK (7)
or
.BR MG_LEAVE_IND (7)
primitive.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
Media gateway controller.
