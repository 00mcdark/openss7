.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the TC user any relevant protocol-dependent parameters.
It should be initiated in response to the
.BR TC_INFO_REQ (7)
primitive described above.
The format of this message is one
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
This indicates the primitive type.
.TP
.I TSDU_size
A value greater than zero specifies the maximum size of a transaction service data unit (TSDU); a
value of zero specifies that the TC provider does not support the concept of TSDU, although
it does support the sending of a data stream with no logical boundaries preserved across an
association; a value of -1 specifies that there is no limit on the size of a TSDU; and a value of -2
specifies that the transfer of normal data is not supported by the TC provider.
.TP
.I ETSDU_size
A value greater than zero specifies the maximum size of an expedited transaction service data unit
(ETSDU); a value of zero specifies that the TC provider does not support the concept of
ETSDU, although it does support the sending of an expedited data stream with no logical boundaries
preserved across an assocation; a value of -1 specifies that there is no limit on the size of an
ETSDU; and a value of -2 specifies that the transfer of expedited data is not supported by the
TC provider.
.TP
.I CDATA_size
A value greater than or equal to zero specifies the maximum amount of data that may be associated
with association establishment primitives; and a value of -2 specifies that the TC provider
does not allow data to be sent with association establishment primitives.
.TP
.I DDATA_size
A value greater than or equal to zero specifies the maximum amount of data that may be associated
with the association termination primitives; and a value of -2 specifies that the TC provider does not
allow data to be sent with the association termination primitives.
.TP
.I ADDR_size
A value greater than or equal to zero indicates the maximum size of a transaction protocol address;
and a value of -2 specifies that the TC provider does not provide TC user access to
transaction protocol addresses.
.TP
.I OPT_size
A value greater than or equal to zero indicates the maximum number of bytes of protocol-specific
options supported by the TC provider; and a value of -2 specifies that the TC provider does
not support TC user-settable options.
.TP
.I TIDU_size
This is the amount of TC user data that may be present in a single
.BR TC_CONT_REQ (7)
primitive.
This is the size of the transaction protocol interface data unit, and should not exceed the tunable
system limit, if non-zero, for the size of a
.IR STREAMS (4)
message.
.TP
.I SERV_type
This field specifies the service type supported by the TC provider, and is a bitwize OR of
zero or more of the following:
.RS
.TP 14
.B TC_OPCLASS1
The TC provider service is operation class 1.
.TP
.B TC_OPCLASS2
The TC provider service is operation class 2.
.TP
.B TC_OPCLASS3
The TC provider service is operation class 3.
.TP
.B TC_OPCLASS4
The TC provider service is operation class 4.
.RE
.TP
.I CURRENT_state
This is the current state of the TC provider.
.TP
.I PROVIDER_flag
This field specifies additional properties specific to the TC provider and may alter the
way the TC user communicates.
The following flags may be set by the TC provider:
.RS
.TP 14
.B SENDZERO
This flag indicates that the TC provider supports the sending of zero-length TSDUs.
.TP
.B XPG4_1
This flag indicates that the TC provider supports XPG4 semantics.
.RE
.TP
.I TCI_version
is the version of the interface.
.SH RULES
.PP
The following rules apply when the type of service is
.BR TC_CLTS :
.IP - 3
The ETSDU_size, CDATA_size and DDATA_size fields should be -2.
.IP -
The TSDU_size should equal the TIDU_size.
.SH MODES
.PP
Operation classes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
TC provider.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B <ss7/tc.h>
\- the transaction component interface header file.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR tci (7),
.BR M_PCPROTO (9),
.BR TC_CONT_REQ (7),
.BR TC_INFO_REQ (7),
.BR TC_ADDR_REQ (7),
.BR TC_ADDR_ACK (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transaction Component Interface first appeared in OpenSS7.
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
This interface conforms to TCI Revision 0.9.2, Draft 1.
