.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This man page describes the STREAMS interface which is used to manage and
configure SS7 modules and drivers conforming to the \fIOpenSS7\fR Local
Management Interface (LMI) specification.
.PP
LMI is the common interface to \fIOpenSS7\fR modules and drivers configured by
the SS7 Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8) using \fBstreamio\fR(7)
\fBI_PUSH\fR and \fBI_LINK\fR ioctls.  This interface is also available for
the development of special purposes management entities (e.g. SNMP, TMN) for
management of the \fIOpenSS7\fR stack.  All SS7 drivers, modules and
multiplexors in the \fIOpenSS7\fR stack provide for LMI management.
.PP
The LMI consists of two subcomponents:
.TP
.I "LOCAL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE"
LMI provides a local management interface which utilizes \fBM_PROTO\fR and
\fBM_PCPROTO\fR messages which can be exchanged with the interface using
\fBputmsg\fR(2s) and \fBgetmsg\fR(2s) system calls on the stream head once the
interface is opened.  The local management interface controls local management
(STREAMS configuration functions) which are normally used by the SS7
Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8) on the driver interface or the control
channel of a multiplexor before pushing a module on the stream head or linking
a stream under the multiplexor.  The local management interface is described
in detail in the the section "LOCAL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE".
.TP
.I "PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE"
LMI provides a protocol management interface which utilizes \fBM_PROTO\fR and
\fBM_PCPROTO\fR messages which can be exchanged with \fBputmsg\fR(2s) and
\fBgetmsg\fR(2s) system calls on the stream head or control stream once the
interface is opened, or \fBM_CTL\fR messages between modules.  The protoocl
management interface supports general and layer-specific configuration, state
inquiry, event and statistics control (SNMP functions) which are normally used
by the SS7 Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8) on the driver interface or
multiplexor control channel before or after the SS7 protocol stack has been
configured.
.TP
.I "INPUT OUTPUT CONTROL INTERFACE"
LMI provides a control interface which utilizes \fBioctl\fR(2s) transparent
calls, pass-through calls, or \fBI_STR\fR ioctl calls using \fBstreamio\fR(7)
from a stream head or a multiplexor control stream.  The control interface
provides for the control of layer-specific and device-specific aspects which
are outside the scope of the SS7 protocol proper, such as interface
configuration and is normally used by the SS7 Configuration Daemon
\fBss7d\fR(8) or upstream modules during stack operation.
.\"
.SH "LOCAL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE"
.SS "PPA STYLE"
.PP
From the local management view, most low-level LMI providers can support two
style for Point of Physical Address (PPA) selection.  These sytles are as
follows:
.TP
.B LMI_STYLE1
A \fIStyle 1\fR driver is a driver whose Point of Physical Address (PPA) is
associated with the stream at open time.  These drivers do not really
do anything in response to the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7),
but still require the
primitive to move the interface from the \fBLMI_UNATTACHED\fR state to the
\fBLMI_DISABLED\fR state.  \fIStyle 1\fR drivers do not require PPA addresses.
.TP
.B LMI_STYLE2
A \fIStyle 2\fR driver is a driver whose Point of Physical Appearance (PPA)
must be attached to the stream after open.  These drivers open in the
\fBLMI_UNATTACHED\fR state and must be attached with a
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
local management primitive to associate them with a PPA before they can be
enabled for use.  \fIStyle 2\fR drivers require a PPA (Physical Point of
Attachment) address to indicate the physical transmission channel to which the
stream is to be attached.  The PPA Address is an opaque address which is
meaningful only to a specific driver implementation.
.\"
.SS "LOCAL MANAGEMENT STATES"
.PP
From the perspective of local management, the LMI provider can be in a number
of management states.  Some local management primitives are applicable only in
specific states.  The LMI provider can be moved through the states with local
management primitives.
.PP
The management states of the LMI provider are as follows:
.TP
.B LMI_UNATTACHED
The LMI driver or module is not attached to a PPA.  This state is only
meaningful to \fIStyle 2\fR drivers which must be explicitly attached to a
specific transmission channel.  Both \fIStype 1\fR and \fIStyle 2\fR drivers
open in this state.
.TP
.B LMI_UNUSABLE
The LMI driver or module is unusable.  This state occurs when the STREAMS
module or driver is no longer able to perform local management actions on the
LMI provider.  This may be due to the failure, removal, or failure to
communicate with, some component in the system.  The LMI provider cannot be
moved to this state with a local management primitive: this state only results
from internal events.
.TP
.B LMI_DISABLED
The LMI driver or module is attached but has not yet been enabled for use.
The driver must be enabled with a
.BR LMI_ENABLE_REQ (7)
local management primitive before data or protocol primtives may be exchanged
with the driver or module.
.TP
.B LMI_ENABLE_PENDING
The LMI driver or module has accepted a
.BR LMI_ENABLE_REQ (7)
request on the interface, but the provider must wait until some event occurs
before the provider can be considered to be enabled.  The provider will
respond with a
.BR LMI_ENABLE_CON (7)
confirmation once the enabling is successful, or a
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
if unsuccessful.
.PP
Most drivers use the
.BR LMI_ENABLE_REQ (7)
primitive and this state to peform initialization on the device and
preparations necessary for data exchange such as assignment and activation of
interrupt service routines.  Because this initialization may entail
communications with independent interface processors, a pending state is
provided.
.TP
.B LMI_ENABLED
The LMI driver or module is enabled and ready for use (to provide protocol
services).
.TP
.B LMI_DISABLE_PENDING
The LMI driver or module has accepted a
.BR LMI_DISABLE_REQ (7)
request on the
interface, but the provider must wait until some event occurs before the
provider can be considered disabled.  The provider will respond with a
.BR LMI_DISABLE_CON (7)
confirmation once the disabling is successful, or a
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
if unsuccessful.
.PP
Most drivers use the
.BR LMI_DISABLE_REQ (7)
primitive and this state to perform
deactivation of the device and actions necessary to shut down data exchange
such as removal and deactivation of interrupt service routines.  Because this
deactivation may entail communications with independent interface processors,
a pending state is provided.
.\"
.SS "LOCAL MANAGEMENT PRIMITIVES"
.PP
Local management primitives can be exchanged with the device driver as
\fBM_PROTO\fR or \fBM_PCPROTO\fR primitives using the \fBputmsg\fR(2s) or
\fBgetmsg\fR(2s) system calls on the stream head after opening the device.
This interface is normally used only by the SS7 Configuration Daemon
\fBss7d\fR(8) during STREAMS configuration, or by the upstream protocol
modules during \fBstreamio\fR(7) \fBI_PUSH\fR and \fBI_POP\fR operations.  It
is possible, however, for a user-level program to use this interface directly
on an open driver or module stream head for special purposes and testing.
.PP
Only \fBM_PROTO\fR local management primitives will be deferred during
congestion or overload of the driver or module.  Local management primitives
sent as \fBM_PCPROTO\fR will be discarded and return a
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
in response should it not be possible to execute them immediately.
.PP
Local management primitives provided by the LMI are as follows:
.PP
.BR LMI_INFO_REQ "(7), " LMI_INFO_ACK "(7), " LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
.PP
Invoked by the LMI user to request and return information about the LMI
provider which is of interest to local configuration management.  These
requests are normally performed by the SS7 Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8)
on the stream head.
.TP
.BR LMI_INFO_REQ (7)
.BR LMI_INFO_REQ (7)
uses a \fBlmi_info_req_t\fR structure which contains the
request primitive, \fIlmi_primitive\fR, as its only member
.TP
.BR LMI_INFO_ACK (7)
.BR LMI_INFO_ACK (7)

The style of the driver which may be one of the following:
.RS
.TP
.B LMI_STYLE1
A \fIStyle 1\fR device which is implicitly associated with a transmission
channel at the time that the device is opened.  These devices do not require a
PPA address in the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7).
.TP
.B LMI_STYLE2
A \fIStyle 2\fR device which is explicitly associated with a transmission
channel identified by a \fIlmi_ppa_addr\fR in an
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
local management primitive after opening.  These devices open in the
\fBLMI_UNATTACHED\fR state.
.RE
.TP
.I lmi_ppa_addr
The PPA address that a \fIStyle 2\fR device is attached to.  If the device is
a \fIStyle 1\fR device or an unattached \fIStyle 2\fR device, this member will

.TP
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
containing the error number in \fIlmi_errno\fR and an
error explanation in \fIlmi_reason\fR will be returned by the LMI provider in
the rare event that an error occurs while attempting to retreive the
information requested by a
.BR LMI_INFO_REQ (7).
.PP
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ "(7), " LMI_OK_ACK "(7), " LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
.PP
Invoked by the LMI user to attach a \fIStyle 2\fR LMI driver or module to a
PPA using a PPA Address.  This primitive is normally used by the SS7
Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8) when assembling the SS7 protocol stack.
The PPA address is obtained by the daemon from configuration files.
.TP
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
Request that the LMI driver or module attach to the PPA address specified in
the request.  The
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive is only valid from the \fBLMI_UNATTACHED\fR state for a \fIStyle
1\fR or \fIStyle 2\fR interface.
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
uses the \fBlmi_attach_req_t\fR structure as follows:
.RS
.sp
.nf
typedef struct {
    lmi_ulong   lmi_primitive;  /* LMI_ATTACH_REQ */
    lmi_ulong   lmi_ppa[0];

\fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCGCONFIG\fR, \fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCSCONFIG\fR
Used to get or set the configuration variables associated with the protocol
for a specific LMI driver or module.  There are no common configuration
fields.  See the specific driver man page for details.
.TP
\fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCTCONFIG\fR, \fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCCCONFIG\fR
Used to test and commit a configuration using SNMP setup/commit semantics for
a specific LMI driver or module.  There are no common configuration fields.
See the specific driver man page for details.
.TP
\fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCGSTATEM\fR
Get state machine state variables, flags, timer-values and other protocol
state machine attributes for a particular protocol driver or module.  There
are no common state machine fields.  See the specific driver man page for
details.
.TP
\fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCCMRESET\fR
Perform a master reset on the state machine.  This returns the state machine
to Power-On conditions.  This control returns the same information as a
\fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCGSTATEM\fR call.  There are no common state machine fields.
See the specific driver man page for details.
.TP
\fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCGSTATSP\fR, \fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCSSTATSP\fR
Used to get or set the statistics collection interval for the collection of
statistics from the LMI driver or module.  The three common fields form a
common header for all statistics period information and are contains in the
\fBlmi_sta_t\fR structure as follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf
typedef struct lmi_sta {
    lmi_ulong   object_id;  /* object id for stats      */
    lmi_ulong   colperiod;  /* collection period        */
    lmi_ulong   timestamp;  /* timestamp end of period  */
} lmi_sta_t;
.fi
.TP
.I object_id
Contains the object id of the statistics.
.TP
.I colperiod
Contains the collection period which is being set for specified statistics.
The collection period is in jiffies (1/HZ seconds) and indicates the
aggregation period for specified statistics.
.TP
.I timestamp
Contains a timestamp (secconds since epoch) which indicates the time boundary
at which at least on collection period occurred in the past.  This value can be
used to determine the system clock time at which the next collection interval
is to occur.
.RE
.TP
\fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCGSTATS\fR, \fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCSSTATS\fR
Gets or sets statistics which have been collected for the LMI driver or module
in the current (or just previous but not notified) collection interval.  The
common field of all statistics structures is the \fIheader\fR field which
contains the timestamp of the collection interval for which the current
statistics apply.
.TP
\fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCGNOTIFY\fR, \fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCSNOTIFY\fR, \fIxxx\fR\fB_IOCCNOTIFY\fR
Gets, sets or clears notifications from the LMI driver or module.  There are
no common notification fileds.  See the specific driver man page for more
details.
