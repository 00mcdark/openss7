.TH TR_BEGIN_RES 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Transaction Interface (TRI)"
.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_BEGIN_RES
\- Connection Response
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks if any user data is specified by the transaction user.
The format of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TR_begin_res {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_BEGIN_RES */
    ulong TRANS_id;           /* Transaction id */
    ulong ASSOC_flags;        /* Association flags */
    ulong ORIG_length;        /* Originating address length */
    ulong ORIG_offset;        /* Originating address offset */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* Options structure length */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* Options structure offset */
} TR_begin_res_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive is sent by a transaction user to the transaction provider on a listening transaction
endpoint (hereafter, for brevity, referred to as the listener) on which the transaction user
received a
.BR TR_BEGIN_IND (7).
This primitive requests that the transaction provider should accept the connection indication
identified by
.IR TRANS_id .
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
Always
.BR TR_BEGIN_RES .
.
.TP
.I TRANS_id
is the transaction identifier that uniquely identifies this transaction association.
This must be the same identifier that was received by the transaction user in the corresponding
.BR TR_BEGIN_IND (7)
to which this message is responding.
.
.TP
.I ASSOC_flags
is the responding association options flags.
.
.TP
.I ORIG_length
is the length of the responding protocol address.
.
.TP
.I ORIG_offset
is the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the responding protocol address begins.
.
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the responding options.
.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the responding options begin.
.
.PP
The proper alignment of the options in the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is not guaranteed.
The options in the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block are, however, aligned the same as they were received from the transaction user.
.SH RULES
.PP
.PP
This primitive requires the transaction provider to generate one of the following acknowledgements
on receipt of the primitive, and the transaction user wait for the acknowledgement before issuing
any other primitives:
.SS Successful
Correct acknowledgement of the primitive is indicated via the
.BR TR_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SS Non-fatal errors
These errors will be indicated via the
.BR TR_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.RB [ TRACCES ]
This indicates that the user did not have proper permissions for the use of the options or
responding address.
.TP
.RB [ TRBADADDR ]
The specified responding protocol address was in an incorrect format or contained illegal
information.
.TP
.RB [ TRBADDATA ]
The amount of user data specified was invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TRBADOPT ]
This indicates that the options were in an incorrect format, or they contained invalid information.
.TP
.RB [ TRBADID ]
The transaction identifier specified in the primitive was incorrect or invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TRNOTSUPPORT ]
This primitive is not supported by the transaction provider.
.TP
.RB [ TROUTSTATE ]
The primitive would place the transaction interface out of state.
.TP
.RB [ TRSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in the primitive.
.SH MODES
.PP
Only connection-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
