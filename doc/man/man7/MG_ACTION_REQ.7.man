.TH MG_ACTION_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Media Gateway Interface (MGI)"
.SH NAME
.B MG_ACTION_REQ, MG_action_req, MG_action_req_t
\- action request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive is one
.B M_PROTO
message block, followed by zero ore more
.B M_DATA
message blocks.  The
.B M_PROTO
message block is structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MG_action_req {
    ulong mg_primitive;         /* always MG_ACTION_REQ */
    ulong mg_action;            /* requested action */
    ulong mg_se_id;             /* session id */
    ulong mg_tp_id;             /* termination id to perform action */
    ulong mg_duration;          /* duration in milliseconds */
    ulong mg_flags;             /* option flags */
} MG_action_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Requests that the action of the requested type be performed against the
specified session and termination point for the requested duration and with
the requested options.
.PP
When more data is indicated using the
.B MG_MORE_DATA
flag, it indicates that subsequent
.B MG_ACTION_REQ
primitives contain more data for the associated pattern.  The data is encoded
according to the media format of the requesting stream.
When the requested duration is zero, the action will continue until its normal
termination, or until subsequently aborted.
.PP
Actions on terminations which are currently connected in a communications
session will be mixed with the media received from the communications session
and any other actions which are currently being performed on the termination.
Actions on terminations which are currently disconnected from a communications
session will be be mixed with the media from other actions on the termination
point.
.PP
Some actions can only be performed on disconnected termination points (e.g.,
.BR MG_ACTION_LOOPBACK ,
.BR MG_ACTION_TEST_SILENT ).
Some actions replace all other actions on the termination point (e.g.,
.BR MG_ACTION_LOOPBACK ,
.BR MG_ACTION_TEST_SILENT ).
Some actions performed on a termination point will be performed on individual
channels that make up the termination point (e.g.
.BR MG_ACTION_LOOPBACK ).
.SH PARAMETERS
