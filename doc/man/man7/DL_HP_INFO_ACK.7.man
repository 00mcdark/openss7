.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B DL_HP_INFO_ACK
primitive is issued by the DLS Provider in response to a
.BR DL_HP_INFO_REQ (7)
primitive from the DLS User.  It conveys information on the state of the
connection on a DLPI Stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_HP_INFO_ACK .
.TP
.I dl_mem_fails
number of memory allocations that failed.
.TP
.I dl_queue_fails
number of times that the DLS provider was unable to forward a message because
the outbound queue was full.
.TP
.I dl_ack_to
length of the ACK timeout in tenths of a second.  The ACK timeout determines
the length of time that LLC Type 2 will ait for an acknowledgement of any
outstanding I PDUs or for a response to a U PDU before attempting to force a
response.
.[
iso/iec 8802-2 : 1998
.]
.[
iso8208
.]
.TP
.I dl_p_to
length of the P timeout in tenths of a second.  The P timeout determines the
length of time that LLC Type 2, after sending a command with the P bit set to
1, will wait for a response with the F bit set to 1 before attempting to force
a response.
.[
iso/iec 8802-2 : 1998
.]
.[
iso8208
.]
.TP
.I dl_rej_to
length fo the REJ timeout in tenths of a second.  The REJ timeout determines
the length of the time that LLC Type 2 will wait for a response to a REJ PDU
before attempting to force a response.
.[
iso/iec 8802-2 : 1998
.]
.[
iso8208
.]
.TP
.I dl_busy_to
length of the BUSY timeout in tenths of a second.  The BUSY timeout determines
the length of time that LLC Type 2 will wait for an indication that a remote
busy condition has been cleared before attempting to force a response.
.[
iso/iec 8802-2 : 1998
.]
.[
iso8208
.]
.TP
.I dl_send_ack_to
length of the SEND_ACK timeout in tenths of a second.  The SEND_ACK timeout
determines the maximum length of time that LLC Type 2 will delay
acknowledgement of I PDUs if it has not received
.[

.]
.[
iso8208
.]
.I dl_send_ack_threshold
I PDUs.
.TP
.I dl_ack_to_cnt
a count of the number of time that the ACK timer has expired.
.TP
.I dl_p_to_cnt
a count of the number of times that the P timer has expired.
.TP
.I dl_rej_to_cnt
a count of the number of times that the REJ timer has expired.
.TP
.I dl_busy_to_cnt
a count of the number of times that the BUSY timer has expired.
.TP
.I dl_local_win
the size of the local receive window in packets.

.TP
.I dl_i_pkts_in;
a count of the number of I PDUs received correctly.
.TP
.I dl_i_pkts_oos;
a count of the number of I PDUs received out of sequence.
.TP
.I dl_i_pkts_in_drop;
a count of the number of I PDUs received correctly, but dropped due to lack of
resources.
.TP
.I dl_i_pkts_out;
a count of the number of I PDUs acknowledged by the remote system.
.TP
.I dl_i_pkts_retrans;
a count of the number of I PDUs re-transmitted.
.TP
.I dl_s_pkts_in
a count of the number of S PDUs received.
.TP
.I dl_s_pkts_out
a count of the number of S PDUs transmitted.
.TP
.I dl_u_pkts_in
a count of the number of U PDUs received.
.TP
.I dl_u_pkts_out
a count of the number of U PDUs transmitted.
.TP
.I dl_bad_pkts
a count of the number of PDUs received with bad control fields.
.TP
.I dl_retry_cnt
a count of the most recent number of times that LLC TYpe 2 has attempted for
force a response from the remote due to a timer expiration.  This value is
reset to zero (0) when a response is received.
.TP

a high water mark of the count
.IR dl_retry_cnt ,
representing the highest count that
.I dl_retry_cnt
has acheived.
