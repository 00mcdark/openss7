.\"
.\"
.SH MODE
This primitive is valid in
any
mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
The message is valid in any state other than

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B DL_SRTABLE_ACK
is a
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
primitive.  It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.BR _UW7_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file to expose the declarations and structures associated with this primitive.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < sys/scodlpi.h >
and
.RB < sys/sr.h>
header files to expose the declarations and structures associated with this primitive.
