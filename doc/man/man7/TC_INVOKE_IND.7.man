.SH NAME
.PP
.B TC_INVOKE_IND
\- Operation Invocation Indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
messae blocks if any operation parameters are indicated by the TC provider.
The format of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TC_invoke_ind {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TC_INVOKE_IND */
    ulong DIALOG_id;          /* Dialog identifier */
    ulong OP_class;           /* Application operation class */
    ulong INVOKE_id;          /* Invoke Identifier */
    ulong LINKED_id;          /* Linked Invoke Identifier */
    ulong OPERATION;          /* Requested operation to invoke */
    ulong MORE_flag;          /* Not last */
} TC_invoke_ind_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive invokes an operation following a dialogue handling message.
.PP
The primitive has a mechanism for specifying whether this is the last group of parameters associated
with the operation.  Multiple
.B TC_INVOKE_IND
primitives that make up the same operation are the same in all respects except for the
.IR MORE_flag .
The
.I MORE_flag
on the last
.B TC_INVOKE_IND
is set to non-zero to indicate that the primitive is the last of a sequence of primitives making up
the same operation.
Not all TC providers provide this mechanism.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
is the primitive type.
Always
.BR TC_INVOKE_IND .
.TP
.I DIALOG_id
is the dialogue identifier to which the component belongs.
Dialogue identifier is ignored for operations class 4
.BR "" ( TC_UNI_IND (7))
operations.
.TP
.I OP_class
is the application operations class.
The application operations class can be one of the following:
.RS
.TP 16
.B TC_OPCLASS1
TC operations class 1.
.TP
.B TC_OPCLASS2
TC operations class 2.
.TP
.B TC_OPCLASS3
TC operations class 3.
.TP
.B TC_OPCLASS4
TC operations class 4.
.RE
.TP
.I INVOKE_id
is the TC provider assigned invocation identifier for this operation.
.TP
.I LINKED_id
is a linked operation invocation identifier if this operation is a child of an invoked operation.
.TP
.I OPERATION
is the operation code.  Operation codes are TC provider specific.
.TP
.I MORE_flag
is a flag indicating if this is the last invoke in the operation.  When this field is non-zero, it
indicates that this is the last sequence of parameters in the invoked operation.
.SH RULES
.PP
Component handling indication primitives are issued after the corresponding Dialogue handling
primitives that indication reception of the following components.  See
.BR tci (7)
for more detail.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
TC provider.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B <ss7/tc.h>

.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transaction Component Interface first appeared in OpenSS7.
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
