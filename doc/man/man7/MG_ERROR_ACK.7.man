.SH NAME
.B MG_ERROR_ACK, MG_error_ack, MG_error_ack_t
\- error acknowledgement
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive is one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MG_error_ack {
    ulong mg_primitive;         /* always MG_INFO_REQ */
    ulong mg_error_primitive;   /* primitive in error */
    ulong mg_error_type;        /* MG interface error type */
    ulong mg_unix_error;        /* UNIX error */
} MG_error_ack_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For primitive that require a local acknowledgement,
.B MG_ERROR_ACK
provides negative acknolwedgement on the receipt of the primitive.
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive has the following parameters:
.TP
.I mg_primitive
always MG_INFO_REQ */
.TP
.I mg_error_primitive
indicates the primitive that was received in error.  This field can be one of
the following values:
.sp
.TS
tab(:);
lbl.
MG_INFO_REQ\fR(7):information request
MG_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR(7):options management request
MG_ATTACH_REQ\fR(7):attach channel request
MG_DETACH_REQ\fR(7):detach channel request
MG_JOIN_REQ\fR(7):join communications session request
MG_ACTION_REQ\fR(7):action request
MG_ABORT_REQ\fR(7):abort action request

.\"MG_DATA_REQ\fR(7):
MG_DISCON_REQ\fR(7):disconnect termination point request
MG_LEAVE_REQ\fR(7):leave communications session request
MG_NOTIFY_REQ\fR(7):notifications request
.TE
.TP
.I mg_error_type
indicates the MGI error number. See
.IR \*(lqERRORS\*(rq ,
below.
.TP
.I mg_unix_error
UNIX error */
indicates the
.BR UNIX \(rg
error number.  When
.I mg_error_type
is
.BR MGSYSERR ,
this field contians the
.BR Linux \(rg
.IR errno (3).
Otherwise, this field is ignored by the MGC and coded zero (0) by the MG.
.SH ERRORS
The error type,
.IR mg_error_type ,
can be one of the following values:
.TP 16
.B MGSYSERR
indicates that a
.BR Linux \(rg
system error occured and the
.BR Linux \(rg
system
.IR errno (3)
is in the primitive.
.TP
.B MGOUTSTATE
indicates that the primitive in error would have placed the interface out of
state.
.TP
.B MGBADPRIM
indicates that the primitive was misformattted or unrecognized.
.TP
.B MGNOTSUPP
indicates that the primitive was known, but not supported.
.TP
.B MGBADID
indicates that an identifier in the primitive was invalid.
.TP
.B MGBADOPTTYPE
indicates that the option type specified in the primitive was inivalid.
.TP
.B MGBADOPT
indicates that the options have a bad format or invalid options.
.TP
.B MGBADFLAG
indicates that a flag in the primitive was invalid.
.TP
.B MGIDBUSY
indicatest that the object specified in the primitive by identifier was
busy.
.TP
.B MGBADACT
indicates that the action number was in error.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Media gateway.
