.SH NAME
.B N_FLOW_REQ, N_flow_req_t
\- flow control request
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block.
The structure of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
typedef struct {
    np_ulong PRIM_type;  /* always N_FLOW_REQ */
    np_ulong FLOW_incr;  /* flow control increment */
} N_flow_res_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests that the NS provider establish or remove flow control.
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.
Always
.BR N_FLOW_REQ .
.\"
.TP
.I FLOW_incr
Flow increment can be a positive integer value or one of the following symbolic
names:
.RS
.TP
.B NP_FC_ZERO
Specifies that the level is to be set to zero (0).
.TP
.B NP_FC_INFINITE
Specifies that the level is to be set to an infinite value.
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in any state.
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
The new state rmains unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B N_FLOW_REQ
is a
.IR GCOM -specific
primitive.  It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.B _GCOM_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/npi.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.  Also, it might be necessary to include the
.RB < sys/npiext.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B N_FLOW_REQ
is compatible with
.IR GCOM ,
.[
npiapi

.B N_FLOW_REQ
is a
.IR GCOM -specific
primitive that is not part of the NPI standard.
.[
npi revision 2.0.0

It should not be used by portable NPI programs.
.IP \(em
.B N_FLOW_REQ
is provided by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
for source compatibility with NS providers and user written to use with
.IR GCOM ,
.[
npiapi
.]
and for porting NS providers and users from
.I GCOM
to

Binary compatibilty is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced may
be removed from the next release.
