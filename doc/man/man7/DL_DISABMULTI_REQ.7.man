.SH INTERFACE
Data Link Provider Interface, DLPI.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0

.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block, which contains the following structure:
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
#include <sys/dlpi.h>

typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_addr_length;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_addr_offset;
} dl_disabmulti_req_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B DL_DISABMULTI_REQ
requests the DLS Provider to disable specific multicast addresses on a per
Stream basis.
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_DISABMULTI_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_addr_length
conveys the length of the physical address
.TP
.I dl_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the multicast address begins
.\"
.\"
.SH MODE
This primitive is valid in
any
mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
This message is valid in any state in which a local acknowledgement is not
pending with the exception of
.BR DL_UNATTACH .
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
If the disable request is successful, a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS user.  If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting state is unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
Address information was invalid or in an incorrect format.
.TP
.B DL_NOTENAB
Address specified is not enabled.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
