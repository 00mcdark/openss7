.SH NAME
.PP
.B TC_UNI_REQ
\- Unidirectional Request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks where each
.BR M_DATA (9)
message block contains zero or more bytes of data.
The format of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TC_uni_req {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TC_UNI_REQ */
    ulong SRC_length;         /* Source address length */
    ulong SRC_offset;         /* Source address offset */
    ulong DEST_length;        /* Destination address length */
    ulong DEST_offset;        /* Destination address offset */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* Options associated with the primitive */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* Options associated wtih the primitive */
    ulong DIALOG_id;          /* Dialog Identifier */
} TC_uni_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests that the TC provider send the specified unidirectional to the
specified destination.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
Always
.BR TC_UNI_REQ .
.TP
.I SRC_length
is the length of the source address
.TP
.I SRC_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block) where the source address begins.
.TP
.I DEST_length
is the length of the destination address
.TP
.I DEST_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block) where the destination address begins.
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the requested options associated with the primitive.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block) of the requested options associated with the primitive.
.TP
.I DIALOG_id
is the dialogue identifier.
.PP
The proper alignment of the destination address, source address and options in the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is not guaranteed.
The destination address and options in the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block are, however, aligned the same as they were received from the TC user.
.PP
This primitive does not require any acknowledgment.
If a non-fatal error occurs, it is the responsibility of the TC provider to report it using
the
.BR TC_NOTICE_IND (7)
indication.
Fatal errors are indicated using a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message type which results in the failure of all operating system service routines on the stream. 
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The allowable fatal errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.RB [ EPROTO ]
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
.RS
.IP - 3
The transaction service interface was found to be in an incorrect state.
.IP -
The amount of TC user data associated with the primitive defines an transaction service
data unit larger than that allowed by the TC provider.
.RE
.SH MODES
.PP
Operation class 4.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
TC user.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B <ss7/tc.h>
\- the transaction component interface header file.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR tci (7),
.BR M_PROTO (9),
.BR M_DATA (9),
.BR M_ERROR (9),
.BR TC_UNI_IND (7),
.BR TC_NOTICE_IND (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transaction Component Interface first appeared in OpenSS7.
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
This interface conforms to TCI Revision 0.9.2, Draft 1.
