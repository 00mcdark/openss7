.SH NAME
.B SL_IN_SERVICE_IND, sl_in_service_ind_t
\- in service indication primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The in-service indication service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
} sl_in_service_ind_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The in-service indication service primitive is issued by the SLS provider to
indicate to the SLS user that a previously invoked link start has successfully
aligned and brought the signalling link into service.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The in-service indication service primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Indicates the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_IN_SERVICE_IND .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only issued in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state.  This primitive is only issued in the
.B SL_STATE_ALIGNED_READY
state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new link state is
.BR SL_STATE_IN_SERVICE .
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS Provider.
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The following rules are observed by the SLS provider when issuing the
in-service indication primitive:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The primitive is only issued in response to a
.BR SL_START_REQ (7)
primitive that was issued from the
.B SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE
state.
.IP \(em
The primitive is only issued once the signalling link has achieved the
.B SL_STATE_IN_SERVICE
state.
