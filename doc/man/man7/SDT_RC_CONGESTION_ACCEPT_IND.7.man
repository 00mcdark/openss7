.SH NAME
.B SDT_RC_CONGESTION_ACCEPT_IND, sdt_rc_congestion_accept_ind_t
\- congestion accept indication primitive
\"
\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The RC congestion accept indication service primtive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sdt_long sdt_primitive;
} sdt_rc_congestion_accept_ind_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The RC convestion accept indication service primitive is indicated by the SDTS
provider when it is experiencing receive congestion but signal units continue
to be delivered by the SDTS provider.  This primitive is an indication from a
provider-specific function in the SDTS provider to the Reception Control (RC)
function in the SDTS user.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The RC congestion accept indication service primtive contains the following
parameters:
.TP
.I sdt_primitive
Indicates the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SDT_RC_CONGESTION_ACCEPT_IND .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only issued when the signalling terminal is in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state and the DAEDR function is in the
.B IN-SERVICE
state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The receive congestion state is moved to
.BR CONGESTION-ACCEPT .
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SDTS Provider.
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The SDTS provider observes the following rules when issuing the RC congestion
accept service primitive:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
This primitive is only issued when the signalling terminal is in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state, the DAEDR function is in the
.B IN-SERVICE
state, and the SDTS provider has detected receive congestion but is not
discarding signal units.
.IP \(em
Not all SDTS providers have a fully functional receive congestion function.
Some SDTS providers may never generate this primitive.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
This primitive does not require a response from the SDTS user.
