.TH MG_ATTACH_ACK 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Media Gateway Interface (MGI)"
.SH NAME
.B MG_ATTACH_ACK, MG_attach_ack, MG_attach_ack_t
\- attach acknowledgement
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive is one
.BR M_PCPROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MG_attach_ack {
    ulong mg_primitive;         /* always MG_ATTACH_ACK */
    ulong mg_mx_id;             /* multiplex id (or 0 for requesting stream) */
    ulong mg_mx_slot;           /* multiplex slot number */
    ulong mg_ch_id;             /* channel id assignment */
} MG_attach_ack_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Acknowledges an
.BR MG_ATTACH_REQ (7).
Returns the channel id.
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive has the following parameters:
.TP
.I mg_primitive
indicates the primitive.  Always
.BR MG_ATTACH_ACK .
.TP
.I mg_mx_id
indicates the multiplex id to which the attach was performed.  When this value
is zero (0), it indicates that the multiplex attached is the requesting stream.
.TP
.I mg_mx_slot
indicates the multiplex slot number that was attached.
.TP
.I mg_ch_id
indicates the channel identifier assignment made to the attached multiplex and
slot.  This channel id can be used to refer to the attached media stream in
subsequent primitives.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Media gateway.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR MG_ATTACH_REQ (7).
