.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B AP_RO_UNBIND_RSP
primitive is used with
.BR ap_snd (3)
and the XAP-ROSE
.[
xap-rose
.]
environment to respond to an association release request of an association
using ROSE
.[
x219
.]
.[
x229
.]
services.
.PP
The ROPM maps the
.B AP_RO_UNBIND_RSP
primitive to the
.BR A_RELEASE_RSP (7)
service directly.  The effects and restrictions of sending the
.BR AP_RO_UNBIND_RSP
primitive are identical to the
.BR A_RELEASE_RSP (7)
primitive.
.PP
Refer to the table on the
.BR ap_snd (3)
manual page under the
.B A_RELEASE_RSP
section, or the
.BR A_RELEASE_RSP (7)
manual page, for these effects and restrictions.
.PP
To send the
.B AP_RO_UNBIND_RSP
primitive, the argument to
.BR ap_snd (3)
must be set as described below:
.TP \w'\fIaperrno_p\fR\(em'u
.I fd
This integer value refers to the descriptor returned from a previous
.BR ap_open (3)
call.  It identifies the library instance that supports the association.
.TP
.I sptype
This argument must be set to
.BR AP_RO_UNBIND_RSP .
.TP
.I cdata
The following members of the
.I cdata
structure are used for this primitive:
.RS
.RS 4
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
long res;          /* result                     */
long rsn;          /* reason for the result      */
long udata_length; /* length of user-information */
long pci;          /* Presentation Context Id    */
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
.I cdata->res
argument must be set to
.BR AP_REL_AFFIRM .
.P
The
.I cdata->rsn
argument must be one of the following:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
.B AP_REL_NORMAL
.br
Shows a normal release.
.IP \(bu
.B AP_REL_NOTFINISHED
.br
Shows the rejection of the release because the user is not finished with the
association.
.PP
The
.I cdata->udata_length
argument must be set to the number of octets of encoded user-information that
will be sent with this primitive if the primitive is issued as more than one
.BR ap_snd (3)
invocation.  If the primitive is issued as a single
.BR ap_snd (3)
invocation, this field will be ignored.
.PP
The
.I cdata->pci
argument must be set to a value representing the presentation context id of a
valid abstract syntax contained in the environment attribute
.BR AP_RO_PCI_LIST .
The ROSE PDU will be encoded within a presentation data value identified by
this
.IR cdata->pci .
.PP
The
.I cdata->res
and
.I cdata->rsn
arguments should be set the same as they are for an
.BR A_RELEASE_RSP (7).
Reference this primitive in the XAP CAE specification
.[
xap c303
.]
for the correct settings.
.RE
.TP
.I ubuf
Use of the
.I ubuf
argument is described on the
.BR ap_snd (3)
manual page.
.TP
.I flags
This argument is used to control certain aspects of primitive processing as
described in the manual page for
.BR ap_snd (3)
in the referenced XAP specification.
.[

.I aperrno_p

occurs.

.SH ERRORS
.PP
Refer to the
.BR ap_snd (3)
manual page.
.PP
In addition to the errors listed in the
.BR ap_snd (3)
manual page, the following error code has the defined additional meaning for
XAP-ROSE primitives:
.TP \w'[\fBAP_RO_BAD_PCI\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ AP_BADCD_RES ]
The value of
.I cdata->res
is not valid.
.TP
.RB [ AP_BADCD_RSN ]
THe value of
.I cdata->rsn
is not valid.
.TP
.RB [ AP_RO_BAD_PCI ]
The PCI is not in the
.BR AP_RO_PCI_LIST .
.TP
.RB [ AP_BADPRIM ]
For
.B XAP-ROSE
primitives, this error code may be returned if the identified instance is not
an
.B XAP-ROSE
instance\(emthat is, the service provider selected in the call to
.BR ap_open (3)
does not support a ROSE service provider, or the
.B AP_ROSE_MODE
flag has not been set in the
.B AP_MODE_SEL
environment attribute.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B AP_RO_UNBIND_RSP
must be used instead of
