.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_ERROR_ACK
\- Error Acknowledgment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of a
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TR_error_ack {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always T_ERROR_ACK */
    ulong ERROR_prim;         /* primitive in error */
    ulong TRPI_error;         /* TRPI error code */
    ulong UNIX_error;         /* UNIX error code */
    ulong TRANS_id;           /* Transaction id */
} TR_error_ack_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the transaction user that a non-fatal error has occurred in the last
transaction-user-originated primitive.
.PP
For an overview of the error handling capabilities available to the transaction provider see
.BR tri (7).
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive.
.TP
.I ERROR_prim
identifies the primitive type that caused the error
.TP
.I TRPI_error
contains the transaction Level Interface error code.
.TP
.I UNIX_error
contains the Linux system error code.
This may only be non zero if
.I TRPI_error
is equal to
.BR TRSYSERR .
.TP
.I TRANS_id
is the transaction identifier for the transaction upon which the primitive caused an error.
.SH RULES
.PP
This may only be initiated as an acknowledgment for those primitives that require one.
It also indicates to the user that no action was taken on the primitive that caused the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The list of Transaction Interface error codes follows:
.TP 16
.BR "" [ TRBADADDR ]
Incorrect address format/illegal address information.
.TP
.BR "" [ TRBADOPT ]
Options in incorrect format or contain illegal information.

.TP
.BR "" [ TRBADQOSPARAM ]
QOS values specified are outside the range supported by the TR provider.
.TP
.BR "" [ TRBADQOSTYPE ]
QOS structure type specified is not supported by the TR provider.
.TP
.BR "" [ TRBADTOKEN ]
Token used is not associated with an open stream.
.TP
.BR "" [ TRNOPROTOID ]
Protocol id could not be allocated.
.SH MODES
.PP
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
Transaction provider.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
<ss7/tr.h>
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
