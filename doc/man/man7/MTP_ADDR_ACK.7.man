.TH MTP_ADDR_ACK 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "MTP Interface (MTPI)"
.SH NAME
.B MTP_ADDR_ACK
\- Protocol Address Acknowledgement
.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consist of one
.BR M_PCPROTO
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MTP_addr_ack {
    mtp_ulong mtp_primitive;    /* always MTP_ADDR_ACK */
    mtp_ulong mtp_loc_length;   /* length of local MTP address */
    mtp_ulong mtp_loc_offset;   /* offset of local MTP address */
    mtp_ulong mtp_rem_length;   /* length of remote MTP address */
    mtp_ulong mtp_rem_offset;   /* offset of remote MTP address */
} MTP_addr_ack_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the MTP User any bound or connected MTP-SAP
addresses.  It should be initiated in response to the
.BR MTP_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive.
.SS PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mtp_primitive
Indicates the primitive type.
.TP
.I mtp_loc_length
Indicates the length of the local (bound) address.
.TP
.I mtp_loc_offset
Indicates the offset of the local (bound) address from the beginning of the
message block.
.TP
.I mtp_rem_length
Indicates the length of the remote (connected) address.
.TP
.I mtp_rem_offset
Indicates the offset of the remote (connected) address from the beginning of
the message block.
.SS RULES
.IP \(em 4
If no local address is bound, the \fImtp_loc_length\fR and \fImtp_rem_length\fR fields will be coded zero (0).
.IP \(em
If no remote address is connected, the \fImtp_rem_length\fR field will be coded zero (0).
.SS STATE
This primtiive is valid
when no local acknowledgement is pending and
in any state other than
.BR MTP_UNUSABLE .
The state remains unchanged.
.SS ORIGINATOR
This primitive is originated by the MTP Provider.
.SS MODES
This primitive is valid in all modes.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR MTP_ADDR_REQ (7).
.SH VERSIONS
The Message Transfer Part (MTP) Interface (MTPI) is unique to
.BR OpenSS7 .
This is Version 2 of the interface.
