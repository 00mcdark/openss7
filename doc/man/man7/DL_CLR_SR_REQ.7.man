.SH INTERFACE
Data Link Provider Interface, DLPI,
.[

.]
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific.
.[

.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9(
message block, which contains the following structure:
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
#define _UW7_SOURCE
#include <sys/dlpi.h>
#include <sys/scodlpi.h>
#include <sys/sr.h>

typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
} dl_attach_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_CLR_SR_REQ
requests that the DLS provider clear all entries from the source routing table.
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The
.B dl_clr_sr_req_t
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_CLR_SR_REQ .
.\"
.\"
.SH MODE
This primitive is valid in
any
mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
The message is valid in any state other than
.BR DL_UNATTACHED ,
but only when local acknowledgement of a request or response primitive is not
pending for the requesting Stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state
remains unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
If the attach request is successful,
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS user.
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting state is unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
One of the following errors may be returned in the
.B DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive:
.TP
.B DL_ACCESS
The DLS user did not have proper permission to use the primitive.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_BADPRIM
The primitive is not known to the DLS provider.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
The primitive is known to, but not supported by, the DLS provider.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in
the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
See
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
for a description of specific Linux error codes applicable to DLPI.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B DL_CLR_SR_REQ
is a
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
primitive.  It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.BR _UW7_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file to expose the declarations and structures associated with this primitive.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < sys/scodlpi.h >
and
.RB < sys/sr.h>
header files to expose the declarations and structures associated with this primitive.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B DL_CLR_SR_REQ
is compatible with
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B DL_CLR_SR_REQ
is a
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
primitive that is not part of the DLPI standard.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
It should not be used by portable DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
documents the primitive types to be
.B ulong
rather than
.BR t_uscalar_t .
This is likely an error that is consistent with versions of the DLPI before Revision 2.0.0.
Under
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
all primitives are of type
.BR dl_ulong ,
which is a 32-bit unsigned integer value on all architectures.
The DLPI standard uses
.BR t_uscalar_t ,
which is at least a 32-bit unsigned integer.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
does not support the
.B DL_UNATTACHED
state.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
does not document any DLPI errors other than
.BR DL_NOTSUPPORTED .
.IP \(em
.B DL_CLR_SR_REQ
is provided by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
for source compatibility with DLS Providers and Users written for use with
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
and for porting DLS Providers and Users from
.IR UnixWare \(rg
to
.IR Linux \(rg.
Binary compatibility is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced may be
removed from the next release.
