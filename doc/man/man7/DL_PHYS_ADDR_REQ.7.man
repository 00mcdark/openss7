.TH DL_PHYS_ADDR_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)"
.SH NAME
.B DL_PHYS_ADDR_REQ (dl_phys_addr_req_t)
\- this primitive requests the DLS provider to return either the default
(factory) or the current value of the physical address associated with the
stream depending upon the value of the address type selected in the request.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
Data Link Provider Interface, DLPI.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block containing the structure shown below:
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
#include <sys/dlpi.h>

typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_addr_type;
} dl_phys_addr_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_PHYS_ADDR_REQ
requests the DLS provider to return either the default
(factory) or the current value of the physical address associated with the
stream depending upon the value of the address type selected in the request.
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_PHYS_ADDR_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_addr_type
conveys the type of address requested - factory physical address or
current physical address:
.RS
.TP \w'\fBDL_FACT_PHYS_ADDR\fP\(em'u
.B DL_FACT_PHYS_ADDR
factory physical address
.PD 0
.TP
.B DL_CURR_PHYS_ADDR
current physical address.
.PD
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH MODE
This primitive is valid in
any
mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
The message is valid in any attached state in which a local
acknowledgement is not pending.  For a style 2 provider, this would be after
a PPA is attached using the
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ (7).
For a Style 1 provider, the PPA is implicitly attached after the stream is
opened.
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
The provider responds to the request with a
.BR DL_PHYS_ADDR_ACK (7)
if the request is supported.  Otherwise, a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
Primitive is known, but not supported by the DLS Provider.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B DL_PHYS_ADDR_REQ
primitive is compatible with implementations based on DLPI Revision 2,
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2

such as
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixdlpi
.]
.IR HP-UX \(rg,

soldoc11
.]
.IR Solstice \(rg,
.[
solx25pg

.BR dlpi_ioctl (4),
.BR STREAMS (9),
for additional compatibility information.
