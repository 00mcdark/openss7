.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B TPI-TCAP
provides a stream supporting the Transport Provider Interface,
.RB tpi (7),
to the Transport Capabilities Application Part (TCAP).
This
.IR STREAMS (4)
interface provides the
.BR tcap (4)
or
.BR tua (4)
protocol service interface using the T-primitives of the
.BR tpi (7).
This interface is intended solely for use by user programs, libraries such as
.BR xnet (3),
.BR xti (3)
and
.BR sockets (3),
or protocol modules requiring the
.BR tpi (7)
interface such as
.BR timod (4),
.BR sockmod (4)
and
.BR socksys (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH "ADDRESS FORMATS"
.PP
The
.B TPI-TCAP
uses the same address as SCCP.  See
.BR tpi_sccp (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.B TPI-TCAP
provides options at the
.B T_SS7_TCAP
option level as described in the sections which follow.  Of the
.B T_SS7_TCAP
level protocol options,
.BR T_TCAP_OPCLASS
is of end-to-end significance.
.\"
.\"
.PP
In addition,
.B TPI-TCAP
supports options at the following levels:

.SS T_INFO_REQ
.PP
This primitive is interpreted as described in
.BR T_INFO_REQ (7).
.\"
.\"
.SS T_INFO_ACK
.PP
This primitive is interpreted as described in
.BR T_INFO_ACK (7),
with the following notes:
.\"
.\"
.PP
The fields in the
.BR T_INFO_ACK (7)
message are populated by the TCAP provider as follows:
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I TSDU_size
The transport service data unit represents the maximum size of a TC-CONTINUE
primitive in TCAP considering the use of TCAP segmentation.  This is the
maximum size of a TCAP message regardless of segmentation.  Therefore, TCAP
conforming transport service providers will return
.B T_INFINITE
for this field.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I ETSDU_size
TCAP has no concept of expedited transport data units.  TCAP conforming
transport service providers will return
.B T_INVALID
for this field.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I CDATA_size
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I DDATA_size
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I ADDR_size
The address is a
.B sockaddr_sccp
structure with the size of a
.B sockaddr
structure.  This field should always return the size of a
.B sockaddr
structure or greater.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I OPT_size
This field is interpreted as described in
.BR T_INFO_ACK (7).
Care should be taken that the TCAP conforming transport service provider does
not return too large a value: this value is used for reserving buffers using
.BR t_alloc (3)
in
.BR xti (3).
Therefore, this value should not be greater than the sum of the sizes of all
of the options described under
.IR \*(lqOPTIONS\*(rq ,
above, plus the size of the
.B t_opthdr
structure for each option listed.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I TIDU_size
The transport interface data unit size is the maximum size of data that can be
transferred accross the TPI interface for the given stream.  For TCAP, this is
the maximum amount of payload that can fit into a CONTINUE or CONVERSATION
message.  This is because
.B TPI-TCAP
cannot (or would prefer not to) break down components.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I SERV_type
The service type is one of the following:
.\"
.\"
.RS
.TP
.B T_CLTS
The connectionless service type is only returned for TCAP operation class 4.
.TP
.B T_COTS
The connection oriented service type is returned for application TCAP
operation classes 1, 2 and 3.
.TP
.B T_COTS_ORD
The connection oriented with orderly release service type is returned for
private TCAP operation classes 1, 2 and 3.

The length and offset from the beginning of the primitive message block of the

perform a \*(lqwildcard\*(rq bind.  For such a bind, the TCAP provider
observes the following rules:
.\"
.\"
.RS
.IP \(em 4
If an application context has been specified for the stream with
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7),
the TCAP provider will bind the stream as a default destination for
connectionless classes or default listener for connection oriented classes on
the specified application context.
.\"
.\"

If no application context has been provided, the TCAP provider will
bind the stream to the default destination for connectionless classes or as
the default listener for connection oriented classes.
.\"
.\"

A stream bound to the default destination will receive all connectionless
packets that have no other bind match.  A stream bound as a default listener
will receive all connection indications that have no other stream listening.
Onlly one stream may be bound as a default destination and one stream bound as
a default listener.
.RE
.\"

The TCAP operations class 4 protocol is a connectionless protocol and will not
accept a non-zero number in the
