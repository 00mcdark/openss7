.SH NAME
.B SDT_LSC_LINK_FAILURE_IND, sdt_lsc_link_failure_ind_t
\- link failure indication primitive
\"
\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The link failure indication service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sdt_long sdt_primitive;
} sdt_lsc_link_failure_ind_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This SDTS provider originated primitive is issued by the SDTS provider while
the SUERM/EIM service is active to indicate that the error rate monitor has
detected errors that exceed the configured threshold and that the link should
be failed for execessive errors.  This primitive is an indication from the
SUERM/EIM function in the SDTS provider to the Link State Control (LSC)
function in the SDTS user.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The link failure service primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I sdt_primitive
Indicates the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SDT_LSC_LINK_FAILURE_IND .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive will only be issued when the signalling terminal is in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state and the SUERM/EIM is in the
.B IN-SERVICE
state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new state for the SUERM is the
.B IDLE
state.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SDTS Provider.
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The following rules apply to the link failure indication service primitive:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The SDTS provider will only issue an
.BR SDT_LSC_LINK_FAILURE_IND (7)
primitive
while the SUERM or EIM is in the
.B IN-SERVICE
state and the monitored error
rate exceeds the operating threshold configured for the error monitor.  After
issuing the primitive, the SUERM is placed in the
.B IDLE
state.
.IP \(em
Not all STDS providers have a fully functional SUERM/EIM.  Some providers may
never issue this primitive.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
This primitive does not require a response from the SDTS user.
