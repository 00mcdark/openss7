.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This man page describes the STREAMS interface which is used to configure and
exchanged data with an SS7 Device (DEVI) for all SS7 devices conforming to the
\fIOpenSS7\fR Device Interface (DEVI) specification.
.PP
DEVI drivers implement this interface in addition to the \fBsdli\fR(7) or
\fBsdti\fR(7) interface at the driver level.  These are driver specific ioctls
which are used to configure a wide ranges of devices.
.PP
The DEVI interface consists of only a control interface which is utilizes
\fBioctl\fR(2s) tranparent calls or an \fBI_STR\fR ioctl from \fBstreamio\fR(7)
from a stream head to the driver.  Devices may also be controlled from the
stream head of a \fBslsi\fR(7) or \fBmtpi\fR(7) stream head using
\fBioctl\fR(2s) or \fBI_STR\fR ioctl from \fBstreamio\fR(7).  This later method
uses a pass-along ioctl which passes the device control through the
multiplexor to a specified device. (See \fBslsi\fR(7) and \fBmtpi\fR(7).)

The control interface controls specific
aspects of the device driver which are outside the scope of the SS7 protocol.
These controls are normally used by the SS7 Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8)
on the driver interface or multiplexor control channel before or after the
protocol stack has been assembled.  This control interface is described below.

IOCTLs are used to affect the operation of the SS7 device.  A common set of
IOCTLs are available for all SS7 devices as follows:
.TP
.B DEV_IOCGIFTYPE, DEV_IOCSIFTYPE
Gets or sets the value of the interface type.  The interface type is the type
of interface to which the stream device is connected (attached).

.B DEV_IOCGGRPTYPE, DEV_IOCSGRPTYPE
Gets or sets the value of the interface group type.  The interface group type
is the type of the group of communications channels, to a channel of which the
stream is attached.  Interface groups are only meaningful (or required) for
\fIStyle 2\fR drivers which must be explicitly attached to a channel within
the group.  \fIStyle 1\fR drivers (with implicit attachment at open) should be
specified as \fBDEV_GTYPE_NONE\fR.

.B DEV_IOCGIFMODE, DEV_IOCSIFMODE
Gets or sets the interface mode.  Most interfaces can be in one of two modes
depending on the side of the interface to which the device is attached.

.B DEV_IOCGIFCODING, DEV_IOCSIFCODING
Gets or sets the interface bit coding.  Most interfaces can apply one of
several bit line coding.  Some interface and interface group types do not
permit bit codings to be changed.  Not all bit codings are permitted on all
interface types.  Interface types which have implicit bit codings should be
set to either the appropriate coding or to \fBDEV_CODING_NONE\fR.

.B DEV_IOCCDISCTX, DEV_IOCCCONNTX
Diconnects or connects the transmit path.  This is specifically to assist with
Q.781 conformance testing of Level 2 implementations.  One of the conformance
tests in the suite requires that the Tx path be disconnected and reconnected
at several points in the test.  This control is provided to peform that
function in an automated fashion rather than having to physically disconnect
the link.
.TP
.B Private IOCTLs
Specific device driver implementations may require additional IOCTLs which are
used to configure that particular device.  For more information on a
particular device IOCTLs, see the appropriate man page for the device.

.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
.PP
When an IOCTL is successful, it returns 0.  When it is unsuccessful, it
returns -1 and \fIerrno\fR is appropriately set.  When unsuccessful, no
changes will have been made to device parameters or variables.
.SS "Errors"
.PP
Any of the errors which are returned by \fBioctl\fR(2s) or \fBstreamio\fR(7)
\fBI_STR\fR can be returned.  In addition, the following errors may be
returned as a result of the failure of the control operation:
.TP 12
.RB [ EOPNOTSUPP ]
The operation is not supported.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The value which \fIarg\fR points to is not within the valid range.
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
The point \fIarg\fR points outside of the valid address space of the calling
user.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
The calling process does not have the permission or the capabilities to
perform the requested operation.
