.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
or
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, that contains the following structure:
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
#include <sys/dlpi.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B DL_HP_SET_P_TO_REQ
primitive request the DLP Provider set the P timeout to the value specified in
tenths of a second.
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_HP_SET_P_TO_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_p_to
specifies the new value fo the P timeout in tenths of a second.  The P timeout
determines the length of time that LLC Type 2, after sending a command with
the P bit set to 1, will wait for a response with the F bit set to 1 before
attempting to force a response.

.SH MODE
This primitive is valid in
.B DL_CODLS
mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
.PP
The message is valid in state
.BR DL_IDLE ,
.BR DL_DATAXFER ,
.BR DL_OUTCON_PENDING ,
.BR DL_INCON_PENDING ,
.BR DL_USER_RESET_PENDING ,
.BR DL_PROV_RESET_PENDING ,
and when a local acknowledgement is not pending.

.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
.PP
The resulting state remains the same.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
If the request is successful,
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
is issued to the DLS user.
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting state is unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.TP 16
.B DL_ACCESS
The DLS user did not have proper permission to make the request.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.TP
.B DL_BADPRIM
The DLS provider does not recognize the
.B DL_HP_SET_P_TO_REQ
primitive.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
The DLS provider recognizes the
.B DL_HP_SET_P_TO_REQ
primitive, but does not support the primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B DL_HP_SET_P_TO_REQ
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
primitive.  It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.BR _HPUX_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.  Also, it might be necessary to include the
.RB < sys/dlpi_ext.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B DL_HP_SET_P_TO_REQ
is compatible with

.B DL_HP_SET_P_TO_REQ
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
pirmitive that is not part of the DLPI standard.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
It should not be used by portable DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
.B DL_HP_SET_P_TO_REQ
is provided by

for source compatibility with DLS Providers and Users written for use with
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
and for porting DLS Providers and Users from

to
.IR Linux \(rg.
Binary compatibility is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced may be
removed from the next release.
