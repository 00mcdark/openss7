.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests the DLS Provider to enable promiscuous mode on a
per Stream basis, either at the physical level or at the SAP level.
.PP
The DL Provider will route all received messages on the media to the DLS
User until either a
.BR DL_DETACH_REQ (7)
or a
.BR DL_PROMISCOFF_REQ (7)
is received or the
Stream is closed.
.PP
The DLS User uses the supported primitives
.RB ( DL_ATTACH_REQ "(7), " DL_BIND_REQ "(7), " DL_ENABMULTI_REQ "(7), " DL_PROMISCON_REQ )
to define a set of enabled physical and SAP address components on a per Stream
basis.  It is invalid for a DLS Provider to even send upstream a data message
for which the DLS User on that Stream has not requested.  The burden is on the
provider to enforce by any means that it chooses, the isolation of SAP and
physical address space effects on a per-Stream basis.
.PP
When the DLS user requests promiscuous mode at the physical level
.RB ( DL_PROMISC_PHYS ),
the DLS user receives a copy of every packet on the wire for all SAPs.  This has
the same effect (for the local Stream) as though the DLS user could set a
wildcard physical address with the
.BR DL_SET_PHYS_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive.
.PP
When the DLS user requests promiscuous mode at the SAP level
.RB ( DL_PROMISC_SAP ),
the DLS user receives a copy of every packet on the wire directed to that user
(physical address, broadcast address or enabled multicast address) that matches
any SAP for that interface.  This has the same effect as though the DLS user
could bind to a wildcard SAP with the
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive.
.PP
When the DLS user requests promiscuous mode for all multicast addresses
.RB ( DL_PROMISC_MULTI ),
the DLS user receives all packets on the wire that have either a multicast or
group destination address, including broadcast addresses.  This has the same
effect as though the DLS user could enable a wildcard multicast address with the
.BR DL_ENABMULTI_REQ (7)
primitive.

.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
documentation

indicates that only one promiscuous mode can be enabled on a given Stream at any
point in time.  This does not appear to be consistent with the DLPI standard
that places no such restriction on promiscuous modes.  For example, setting
promiscuous mode at the SAP level
.RB ( DL_PROMISC_SAP )
and for multicast addresses
.RB ( DL_PROMISC_MULTI )
makes sense, whereas setting promiscuous mode at the physical level
.RB ( DL_PROMISC_PHYS )
obviously temporarily overrides any setting of other promiscuous modes.
.RS
.PP
For maximum compatibility with DLPI implementations that support multiple
promiscuous modes,
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
also supports multiple promiscuous modes.  This is compatible with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
in that
.IR HP-UX \(rg
drivers, modules and applications do not expect to be able to set multiple
promiscuous modes.  Care should be taken, however, when porting
.IR HP-UX \(rg
drivers, modules and applications that they do not rely upon error
acknowledgements should an attempt be made to set multiple promiscuous modes on
a Stream.
.PP
Portable DLPI drivers, modules and applications will not attempt to set more
than one promiscuous mode on a given Stream.
.RE
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg
documentation

indicates that should the DLS user issue a duplicate request (that is,
attempts to enable at a
.I dl_level
that is already enabled), the DLS provider issues a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
primitive, ignores the duplicate request and does not generate a non-fatal
error.
.RS
.PP
For compatibility when porting
.IR AIX \(rg
drivers, modules and applications to
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" ,
and because there is no DLPI error condition for this case,
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
ignores duplicate requests in the same fashion as
.IR AIX \(rg.
Care should be taken when porting drivers, modules and applications from other
DLPI implementations that they do not rely upon an error being returned in
response to an attempt to set a promiscuous mode repeatedly without first
clearing the mode setting.
.PP
Portable DLPI drivers, modules and applications will not attempt to multiply set
a promiscous mode without first clearing that mode with either
.BR DL_PROMISCOFF_REQ (7)
or
.BR DL_DETACH_REQ (7).

Nowhere is there documentation that provides support for promiscuous modes on
connection-oriented mode or acknowledged connectionless mode DLS providers.
The DLPI specification appears to be consistent with this behavior (as there is
a special \(lqconnection management stream\(rg that can accept connection
indications for a default DLSAP).
.RS
.PP
In support of porting
.IR AIX \(rg
and
.IR Solstice \(rg " X.25
drivers, modules and applications to
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" ,
this primitive is not supported for solely connection-oriented mode or
acknowledged connectionless mode Streams.
.PP
Portable DLPI drivers, modules and applications will not issue this primitive on
a Stream with a DLS provider that supports only a connection-orented nor
acknowledged connectionless mode.  (Note that for
.IR AIX \(rg
compatibility,
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supports multiplex data link service modes on a single Stream.)
