.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The PVC Attach message primitive is used by the NS user when requesting an
attachment of the Stream to a PVC.  The NS provider uses the PVC Attach message
primitive to acknolwedge a previous PVC Attach message primitive issued by the
NS user.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block
containing the
.B pvcattf
structure.
There is no data part
.RB ( M_DATA (9)
message blocks) associated with this message primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The PVC Attach uses the
.B pvcattf
structure.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block
containing the
.B pvcattf
structure.
There is no data part
.RB ( M_DATA (9)
message blocks) associated with this message primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The
.B pvcattf
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I xl_type
Always \fBXL_CTL\fP.
.TP
.I xl_command
Always \fBN_PVC_ATTACH\fP, for PVC Attach.
.TP
.I lci
Conveys the logical channel identifier (LCI) of the PVC.
.TP
.I link_id
Conveys the link identifier for the PVC.  This is a Solstice X.25 specific
field.
.RS
.PP
The \fIlink_id\fP and \fIsn_id\fP fields are equivalent, with a slightly
different name and format for Solstice X.25.
.RE
.TP
.I sn_id
Conveys the subnetwork identifier for the PVC.  This is the non-Solstice X.25
specific field.
.RS
.PP
This field is sometimes specified as a
.BR "unsigned long" .
It has been declared as an
.B uint32_t
to support compatibility of 32-bit applications
running over a 64-bit kernel.
.RE
.TP
.I reqackservice
When non-zero, conveys that the receipt confirmation service is requested by the
use of the D-bit.  This field can have one of the following values:
.RS
.PP
.TS
tab(:);
lnls
lbnls.
Constant:Value:Description
_
-:0:No receipt confirmation.
RC_CONF_DTE:1:Confirmation by the remote terminal.
RC_CONF_APP:2:Confirmation by the remote application.
_
.TE
.PP
In the case of receipt confirmation by the remote station, no acknowledgements
are expected or given over the X.25 NLI service interface.  For receipt
confirmation by the remote application, there is a one-to-one correspondence
between D-bit data and acknolwedgements passing in opposite directions.  One
data acknowledgement is received or sent for each D-bit data packet sent or
received over the X.25 NLI service interface.
.RE
.TP
.I reqnsdulimit
When non-zero, conveys that an NSDU concantenation limit is asserted and the
\fInsdulimit\fP field is valid.
.TP
.I nsdulimit
When non-zero, conveys the packet concatenation limit for NSDUs when the
\fIreqnsdulimit\fP field is also non-zero.
.TP
.I result_code
When the PVC Attach message primitive is used by the NS provider to acknowledge
a previous PVC Attach message primitive issued by the NS user, this field is
non-zero when an error has been encountered that prevents the attachment of the
PVC.
.RS
.PP
This field can have one of the following values:
.PP
.TS
tab(:);
lnls
lbnls.
Constant:Value:Description
_
PVC_SUCCESS:0:Operation was successful.
PVC_NOSUCHSUBNET:1:Subnetwork not configured.
PVC_CFGERROR:2:LCI not in range, no PVCs.
PVC_NODBELEMENTS:3: No database available.
PVC_PARERROR:4:Error in request parameters.
PVC_BUSY:6:PVC in non-attach state.
PVC_CONGESTION:7:Resources unavailable.
PVC_WRONGSTATE:8: State wrong for function.
PVC_NOPERMISSION:9:Inadequate permissions.
PVC_LINKDOWN:10:The link has gone down.
PVC_RMTERROR:11:No reponse from remote.
PVC_USRERROR:12:User interface error detected.
PVC_INTERROR:13:Internal error.
PVC_NOATTACH:14:Not attached yet.
PVC_WAIT:15:Wait code, not to user.

.SH STATE
.PP
This message primitive is valid in the disconnected phase.

.\"
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
When an NS user issues a PVC Attach, the NS user expects a PVC Attach message
primitive from the NS provider in response.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The PVC Attach message primitive is equivalent to the
.BR N_CONN_REQ (7)
and
.BR N_CONN_CON (7)
of the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0

.BR npi (7).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Network Layer Interface (NLI) is a proprietary interface without a formal
standard.  Either the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
or the XTI-X25 interface,
.[
xx25
.]
.BR xti_x25 (3),
should be used in its stead.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B N_PVC_ATTACH
is compatible with NLI, and implementations based on NLI such as
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "HP-UX X.25/9000" ,
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
are consistent in their documentation of
.BR N_PVC_ATTACH .
.IP \(em
NLI is an inherently low level and non-portable interface and should not be
used by portable programs.  Portable programs should use the NPI or XX25
interfaces in its stead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted: only a rough source compatibility.  Any
binary compatibility exhibited is a bug and is scheduled to be removed in the
next release.
.PP
See
.BR NLI (7),
.IR STREAMS (4),
for additional compatiblity considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The NLI is not a formal standard.  The
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implementation of NLI conforms to documentation for Version 3 of the NLI.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The NLI is an interface originally developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now a
division of Emmerson Power).  The NLI interface found its way into may
mainstream UNIX implementations and UNIX-like RTOS sporting STREAMS such as
Windriver's VxWorks.  The NLI was never standardized and remains an inherently
non-portable interface.
