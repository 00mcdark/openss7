.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B AP_RO_RESULT_REQ
primitive is used with the
.BR ap_snd (3)
and the XAP-ROSE environment to show the
.B AP_RO_RESULT
service to the remote host.  This service is in response to a successfully
performed ROSE
.[
x219
.]
.[
x229
.]
operation on behalf of the remote application.
.TP \w'\fIaperrno_p\fP\(em'u
.I fd
This integer value refers to the file descriptor returned from a previous
.BR ap_open (3)
call.  It identifies the library instance that supports the association.
.TP
.I sptype
This argument must be set to
.BR AP_RO_RESULT_REQ .
.TP
.I cdata
The following members of the
.I cdata
structure are used for this primitive:
.RS
.RS 4
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
long udata_length;
long pci;
long invoke_id;
long type;
union {
    unsigned long local;
    ap_objid_t global;
} value;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
.I cdata->pci
argument must be set to a value representing the presentation context id of a
valid abstract syntax contained in the environment variable
.IR ap_ro_pci_list .
The ROSE PDU will be encoded within a presentation data value identified by the
pci.
.PP
The
.I cdata->type
argument signals whether the optional fields of operation and result are sent
and the form they take.
.PP
If
.I type
is set to
.BR NORESULT ,
the optional operation-value and result sequence will not be present in the
ROSE APDU.  This means that no user data may be supplied; any attempt to
provide data results in the error
.RB [ AP_BADDATA ]
being returned.  If
.I type
is set to
.BR AP_RO_LOCAL ,
the operation value is in local format and is contained as an
.B unsigned long
in
.IR cdata->value.local .
If
.I type is
.BR AP_RO_GLOBAL ,
the operation value is in global format.
.PP
In global format, the operation value must be contained in the
.B ap_objid_t
structure
.IR cdata->value.global .
This global operation value should be encoded to
ISO 8825, Basic Encoding Rules (BER),
.[
iso 8825-2
.]
as an object identifier.
.PP
Where this primitive is to be sent using a series of calls to
.BR ap_snd (3),
with the
.B AP_MORE
flag set,
the
.I cdata->udata_length
element should be set to the total number of octets of encoded data,
(representing the
.I result
parameter of the remote operation result) that will be sent with this
primitive.  If the total number of octets of encoded data is not known, this
field may be set to minus one
.RB ( -1 ).
The way in which this element is used and its possible effect on performance is
described in the manual page of the
.BR P_DATA_REQ (7)
primitive in the referenced XAP specification.
.[
xap c303
.]
.PP
The structure
.I cdata
is defined in the header file
.RB < xap_rose.h >.
.RE
.TP
.I ubuf
This function argument is used to pass a data value that represents the
.I result
parameter of the remote operation result.  The data value is in encoded form:
.I cdata->pci
identifies the presentation context used to encode it.  This presentation
context identifies both the abstract syntax (that defines the type of value
encoded), and the transfer syntax (that defines how it was encoded).  Use of
the
.I ubuf
argument is described in the
.BR ap_snd (3)
manual page in the referenced XAP specification.
.[
xap c303
.]
.TP
.I flags
The
.I flags
argument is used to control certain aspects of primitive processing as
described in the manual page for
.BR ap_snd (3)
in the referenced XAP specification.
.[
xap c303
.]
.TP
.I aperrno_p
This must point to a location which will be set to an error code if a failure
occurs.

Refer to the

manual page.
.PP
In addition to the errors listed in the
.BR ap_snd (3)
manual page, the following error code has the defined additional meaning for
XAP-ROSE primitives:
.TP \w'[\fBAP_RO_BADCD_TYPE\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ AP_RO_BAD_PCI ]
The PCI is not in the
.BR AP_RO_PCI_LIST .

.RB [ AP_BADPRIM ]
For
.B XAP-ROSE
primitives, this error code may be returned if the identified instance is not
an
.B XAP-ROSE
instance\(emthat is, the service provider selected in the call to
.BR ap_open (3)
does not support a ROSE service provider, or the
.B AP_ROSE_MODE
flag has not been set in the
.B AP_MODE_SEL
environment attribute.
.TP
.RB [ AP_RO_BADCD_TYPE ]
