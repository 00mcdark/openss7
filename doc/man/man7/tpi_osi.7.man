.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B TPI-OSI
provides a stream supporting the Transport Provider Interface
.BR tpi (7),
to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI),
.[
x200
.]
Transport Services.
.[
x214
.]
This
.IR STREAMS (4)
interface provides the
.BR tp (4)
protocol service interface using the T-primitives of the
.BR tpi (7).
This interface is intended solely for use by user programs or protocol
modules requiring the common
.BR tpi (7)
interface, such as the
.BR xti (3)
and
.BR sockets (3)
libraries.
.\"
.SH ADDRESS FORMATS
.PP
Addressing varies according to whether oen is using the TPI above OSI
Trannsport,
.[
x214
.]
.[
x224
.]
.[

.]
above RFC 1006,

or above CLNP.
.[

.\"
.SS Transport Layer Addressing
.PP
The TSAP, that identifies the transport provider, can be coded in
hexadecimal or as a character string.  A TSAP is formed from the TSEL
followed by the NSAP.  The TSEL in the address is preceded by a 1 octet TSEL
length, and the NSAP in the address is preceded by a 1 octet NSAP length.
.\"
.SS RFC 1006 Addressing
.PP
Addressing for RFC 1006
.[
rfc1006
.]
applications is formatted in the same way as that for transport layer
applications, described above.  When using the
.BR T_CONN_REQ (7)
primitive, the NSAP is replaced by a 4 octet IP address.  When using the
.BR T_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive, the NSAP takes the value \(lq\)rk6\(rq\).
.\"
.SS CLNP Addressing
.PP
The NSAP, that identifies the network provider, can be coded in hexadecimal
or as a character string.  An NSAP is formed from the NSAP preceded by a 1
octet NSAP length.

Specifies the target residual error rate as an \fI\)OPT_RATIO\fP, or
\fB\)-log10(ratio)\fP. Legal
values are all negative numbers and zero.

Specifies the minimum acceptable (maximum) residual error rate as an
\fI\)OPT_RATIO\fP, or \fB\)-log10(ratio)\fP.
Legal values are all negative numbers and zero.

A request for this option is an \fI\)absolute requirement\fP.
.RE

.B T_TCL_PROTECTION
Specifies the protection provided for the unit data.
This option is formatted as a \fB\)t_uscalar_t\fP.
The legal values are \fB\)T_NOPROTECT\fP (no protection feature),
\fB\)T_PASSIVEPROTECT\fP (protection against passive monitoring) or
\fB\)T_ACTIVEPROTECT\fP (protection against modification, replay, addition or
deletion).  Both \fB\)T_PASSIVEPROTECT\fP and \fB\)T_ACTIVEPROTECT\fP may be
set simultaneously using a logical OR, but are exclusive with
\fB\)T_NOPROTECT\fP.
When the \fB\)T_ACTIVEPROTECT\fP or \fB\)T_PASSIVEPROTECT\fP flags are set,
the user may indicate that this is an \fI\)absolute requirement\fP by also
setting the \fB\)T_ABSREQ\fP flag.
.TP
.B T_TCL_PRIORITY
Specifies the priority of the unit data.
This option is formatted as a \fB\)t_uscalar_t\fP.
The legal values are \fB\)T_PRITOP\fP (higher level), \fB\)T_PRIHIGH\fP (high level), \fB\)T_PRIMID\fP (medium level), \fB\)T_PRILOW\fP (low level), \fB\)T_PRIDFLT\fP (lower level).
A request for this option is an \fI\)absolute requirement\fP.
The number of priority levels is not defined by ISO 8072:1996.

It is not included in the ISO transport service definition ISO

but is an additional offer by TPI  Transport users wishing to be truly
ISO-compliant should thus not adhere to it.
.TP
.B T_TCL_CHECKSUM
This option allows disabling/enabling of the checksum computation.  The legal
values are \fB\)T_YES\fP (checksum enabled) and \fB\)T_NO\fP (checksum
disabled).  If this option is provided in
.BR T_UNITDATA_IND (7),
its value indicates whether or not a checksum was present in the received
datagram.  The advisability of turning off checksum check is controversial.
A request for this option is an \fI\)absolute requirement\fP.
