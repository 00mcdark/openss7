.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B AP_RO_UNBIND_IND
primitive is used with
.BR ap_rcv (3)
and the XAP-ROSE environment to show the remote service user wants to release
the association that uses ROSE
.[
x219
.]
.[
x229
.]
services.
.PP
The ROPM maps the
.BR AP_RO_UNBIND_IND
primitive from the
.BR A_RELEASE_IND (7)
service directly.  The effects and restrictions of receiving the
.BR AP_RO_UNBIND_IND
primitive are identical to the
.BR A_RELEASE_IND (7)
primitive.
.PP
Refer to the table on the
.BR ap_snd (3)
manual page under the
.B A_RELEASE_IND
section, or the
.BR A_RELEASE_IND (7)
manual page, for these effects and restrictions.
.PP
When issuing
.BR ap_rcv (3),
the arguments must be set as described on the
.BR ap_rcv (3)
manual page.  On return, the
.BR ap_rcv (3)
arguments will be set as described below:
.TP \w'\fIapperno_p\fP\(em'u
.I fd
This integer value refers to the descriptor returned from a previous
.BR ap_open (3)
call.  It identifies the library instance that supports the association.
.TP
.I sptype
The value pointed to by this argument will be set to
.BR AP_RO_UNBIND_IND .
.TP
.I cdata
The following members of the
.I cdata
structure are used for this primitive:
.RS
.RS 4
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
long rsn;          /* reason for release         */
long udata_length; /* length of user information */
long pci;          /* Presentation Context Id    */
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
.I cdata->rsn
arument will be set to
.BR AP_REL_NORMAL .
.PP
The
.I cdata->udata_length
argument will be set to show the total number of octets of encoded user
information that were received with this primitive.
.PP
The
.I cdata->pci
argument will be set to the value of the presentation context id encoded within
the presentation data value that contained the ROSE PDU.  If no user
information was received, the value of
.I cdata->pci
will be undefined.
.RE
.TP
.I ubuf
Use of the
.I ubuf
argument is described on the
.BR ap_rcv (3)
manual page.
.TP
.I flags
This argument is used to control certain aspects of primitive processing as
described in the manual page for
.BR ap_rcv (3)
in the referenced XAP specification.
