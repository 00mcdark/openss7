.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B P_ACTRESUME_REQ
primitive is used in conjunction with
.BR ap_snd (3)
and the XAP Library environment to provide the user with access to the S-ACTIVITY-RESUME session
service.
.[
x215
.]
The S-ACTIVITY-RESUME session service allows the user to indicate that a previously interrupted
activity is resumed.
.PP
Refer to the table in the manual page description for
.BR ap_snd (3)
for information concerning the effects of sending the
.B P_ACTRESUME_REQ
primitive and restrictions on its use.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
To send a
.B P_ACTRESUME_REQ
primitive, the arguments to
.BR ap_snd (3)
must be set as described below:
.TP \w'\fIaperrno_p\fP\(em'u
.I fd
This argument identifies the APLI/XAP Library instance being used.
.TP
.I sptype
This argument must be set to
.BR AP_P_ACTRESUME_REQ .
.TP
.I cdata
The following members of
.I cdata
are used for this primitive:
.RS
.RS 4
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
long udata_length;             /* length of user-data field */
ap_octet_string_t act_id;      /* activity identifier       */
ap_octet_string_t old_act_id;  /* old activity identifier   */
long sync_p_sn;                /* synchronization point     */
ap_old_conn_id_t *old_conn_id; /* old session connection    */
unsigned long tokens;          /* requested tokens          */
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Where this primitive is to be sent using a series of calls to
.BR ap_snd (3)
with the
.B AP_MORE
flag set,
.I cdata->udata_length
should be set to the total number of octets of encoded user data that will be
sent with this primitive.  If the total number of octets of encoded user-data
is not known this field may be set to minus one
.RB ( -1 ).
However, in some XAP implementations, setting this field to minus one
.RB ( -1 )
may significantly degrade performance as it requires the implementation to
buffer data until a complete SPDU can be transmitted.
.PP
The total number of octets of encoded user-data that can be sent with this
primitive may be subject to an implementation dependent restriction.  Any such
restriction will be stated in the CSQ for an implementation.
.PP
.I cdata->act_id
is an
.B ap_octet_string_t
structure.
.I cdata->act_id.data
points to a buffer that contains to six (6) octets of information used as the new identifier for
this activity.
.I cdata->act_id.length
specifies the length of the octet string (must be less that or equal to six (6)).
.PP
.I cdata->old_act_id
is also an
.B ap_octet_string_t
structure and is subject to the same restrictions described above.  This argument is the original
identifier for the activity that is being resumed.
.PP
.I cdata->sync_p_sn
must be an integer between zero (0) and 999,998.
.PP
.I cdata->old_conn_id
is a pointer to an
.B ap_old_conn_id_t
structure which is defined as
.RS 4
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
typedef struct {
  ap_octet_string_t *clg_user_ref;  /* Calling SS-user reference */
  ap_octet_string_t *cld_user_ref;  /* Called  SS-user reference */
  ap_octet_string_t *comm_ref;      /* Common Reference          */
  ap_octet_string_t *addtl_ref;     /* Additional Reference      */
} ap_old_conn_id_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This argument is used to identify the session connection in which the activity being resumed was
originally started.  The four members of this structure correspond to the calling SS-user reference,
called SS-user reference, common reference and additional refereence components of the old session
connection identifier parameter of the S-ACTIVITY-RESUME request primitive.  If no session
connection identifier is to be sent,
.I cdata->old_conn_id
must be set to
.BR NULL .
.PP
Each of the members of the
.B ap_old_conn_id_t
structure are of type
.B ap_octet_string_t
(see above).  The
.I clg_user_ref
and the
.I cld_user_ref
members must be no longer than sixty-four (64) octets.  The
.I comm_ref
member must be no longer than sixty-four (64) octets.  The
.I addtl_ref
member must be no longer than route (4) octets.  The absence of a particular member of a connection
identifier may be indicated either by setting the corresponding field to
.BR NULL ,
or by specifying a zero-length
.BR ap_octet_string_t .
.PP
.I cdata->tokens
identies the token(s) requested.  Tokens are identified by OR'ing together one or more of the
following values:
.TP \w'\fBAP_SYNCMINOR_TOK\fP\(em'u
.B AP_DATA_TOK
Data token.
.PD 0
.TP
.B AP_MAJACT_TOK
Synchronize-major/activity token.
.TP
.B AP_SYNCMINOR_TOK
Synchronize-minor token.
.TP
.B AP_RELEASE_TOK
Release token.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.I ubuf
Use of the
.I ubuf
argument is described in the manual page for
.BR ap_snd (3).
.TP
.I flags
The
.I flags
argument is used to control certain aspects of primitive processing as defined
in the manual page for
.BR ap_snd (3).
.RS
.PP
When issuing the
.B P_ACTRESUME_REQ
primitive via multiple
.BR ap_snd (3)
calls (using the
.B AP_MORE
bit feature), one or more octets of data must be sent on the final
.BR ap_snd (3)
call of the sequence.

occurs.
