.BI "int " mg_stream " = open(" mg_device ", " flags );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Media Gateway Interface,
.BR MGI ,
specifies a
.IR STREAMS (4)-based
kernel-level instantiation of a Media Gateway Control interface definition
compatible with SGCP, MGCP, MEGACO H.248.1, ITU-T H.245, and other media
control and switching protocols.  The Media Gateway Interface (MGI) enables
the user of a media gateway service to access and use any variety of
conforming media gateway control service providers without specific knowledge
of the provider's protocol.  The service interface is designed to support any
media gateway control service providers, and does not address issues
concerning media gateway circuit management, protocol performance, and
performance analysis tools.  The specification assumes that the reader is
familiar with the ITU-T state machines and media gateway control interface
(e.g. H.248.1), and
.IR STREAMS (4).
.PP
.B MGI
specifies an interface that supports the services provided by the Media
Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP),
.BR mgcp (4),
ITU-T H.248.1 Media Gateway Control (MEGACO),
.BR h248 (4),
and local media switching using the Media Gateway drivers,
.BR mg (4).
See
.BR MG (4)
for a description of appropriate drivers and auxiliary modules.
These specifications are targeted for use by developers and testers of
protocol modules that require media gateway control service.
.SS "The Media Gateway Control Layer"
.PP
The Media Gateway Control Layer provides the means to manage the connection
and disconnection of channels (or termination points) within multi-party
communications sessions.  It is a local control protocol in the sense that
there are no remote peers entities.  Communications is between the local user
entity and the local provider entity only.
.SS "Model of the MGI"
.PP
The MGI defines the services provided by the media gateway control layer to
media gateway controller at the boundary between the media gateway control
layer and the media gateway controller entity.
The interface consists of a set of primitives defined as
.IR STREAMS (4)
messages that provides access to the media gateway control layer services, and
are transferred between the MGC (MGS user) entity and the MG (MGS provider)
entity.  These primitives are of two types; ones that originate from the MGC,
and others that originate from the MG.  The primitives that originate from the
MGC make requests to the MG, or respond to an indication of an event of the
MG.  The primitives that originate from the MG ar either confirmation of a
request or are indications to the MGC that the event has occured.
.PP
The MGI allows the MG to be configured with any media gateway controller
(such as ISDN or H.225.0 call control) that also conforms to the MGI.
A media gateway controller can also be a user program (such as the
.B OpenSwitch
call framework) that conforms to the MGI and accesses the MG via
.BR putmsg (2)
and
.BR getmsg (2)
system call.s
.TP
.B "MGI Services"
The features of the MGI are defined in terms of services provided by the MG,
and the individual primitives that may flow between the MGC and the MG.
.TP
.B "Local Management"
The MGI specification also defines a set of local management functions.  These
services have significance only to the local stream.
.PP
Tables 1, 2 and 3 summarizes the MGI service primitives by their state and
service.
