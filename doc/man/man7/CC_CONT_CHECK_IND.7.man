.SH NAME
.B CC_CONT_CHECK_IND
\- continuity check indication
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_cont_check_ind {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_CONT_CHECK_IND */
    ulong cc_call_ref;          /* call reference */
    ulong cc_addr_length;       /* adress length */
    ulong cc_addr_offset;       /* adress offset */
} CC_cont_check_ind_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the CCS user that a continuity check is being
requested by the CCS user peer on the specified call control address(es)
(signalling interface and circuit identifiers).  Upon receipt of this
primitive, the CCS user should establish a loop back device on the specified
channel and issues the
.BR CC_CONT_TEST_REQ (7)
primitive confirming the loop back.
The CCS user should then wait for the
.BR CC_CONT_REPORT_IND (7)
indicating the
success or failure of the continuity check.
.\"
.\"
.PP
This primitive is only delivered to listening streams listening on the
specified call control addresses or to a stream bound as a default listener in
the same manner as the
.BR CC_SETUP_IND (7).
(A continuity test indication is treated
as a special form of call setup.)
.\"
.\"
.PP
This primitive is only issued to CCS users that successfully bound using the
.BR CC_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive with flag
.B CC_TEST
set and a non-zero number of setup
indications was provided in the
.BR CC_BIND_REQ (7)
and returned in the
.BR CC_BIND_ACK (7).
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_CONT_CHECK_IND .
.TP
.I cc_call_ref
Identifies the call reference that can be used by the CCS user to associate
this message with the
.BR CC_CONT_TEST_REQ "(7) or " CC_RELEASE_REQ (7)
primitive that is to follow.  This value must be unique among the outstanding
.B CC_CONT_CHECK_IND
messages.
.TP
.I cc_addr_length
Indicates the length of the call control address (circuit identifier) upon
which a continuity check is indicated.
.TP
.I cc_addr_offset
Indicates the offset of the requesting address from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.\"
.\"
.\".SS Rules
