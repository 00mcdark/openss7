.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_ADDR_ACK
\- Protocol Address Acknowledgement
.
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s+1\
typedef struct TR_addr_ack {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_ADDR_ACK */
    ulong LOCADDR_length;     /* local address length */
    ulong LOCADDR_offset;     /* local address offset */
    ulong REMADDR_length;     /* remote address length */
    ulong REMADDR_offset;     /* remote address offset */
} TR_addr_ack_t;
\fR\s-1
.fi
.
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the transaction user the local and remote protocol addresses currently
associated with the transaction endpoint or association.
.
.
.
.SS Parameters
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type: always
.BR TR_ADDR_ACK .
.
.TP
.I LOCADDR_length
Indicates the length of the protocol address that was bound to the
.IR stream .
.
.TP
.I LOCADDR_offset
Indicates the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block where the protocol address begins.
.
.TP
.I REMADDR_length
Indicates the length of the protocol address of the remote ASE.
.
.TP
.I REMADDR_offset
Indicates the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block where the protocol address begins.
.
.PP
The proper alignment of the addresses in the
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block is not guaranteed. 
.
.
.
.SS Modes
.PP
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.
.
.
.SS Originator
.PP
Transaction provider.
.
.
.SS "Valid State"
.PP
This primitive is issued in response to a
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive and is valid in any state where a response is pending to a
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7).
.
.
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new state remains unchanged.
.
.
.
.SS Rules
.PP
The following rules apply:
.
.IP \(em 4
If the requested transaction identifier was -1 in the corresponding
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive, and the transaction endpoint is not bound to a local address,
(i.e. it is in the
.B TRS_UNINIT
or
.B TRS_UNBND
state)
the
.I LOCADDR_length
and
.I LOCADDR_offset
fields must be set to 0.
.
.IP \(em
If the requested transaction exists as identifed in the corresponding
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive,
.I LOCADDR_length
and
.I LOCADDR_offset
fields will be populated to reflect the local association address for the specified transaction.
.
.IP \(em
If the requested transaction identifier was -1 in the corresponding
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive, the
.I REMADDR_length
and
.I REMADDR_offset
fields must be set to 0.
.
.IP \(em
If the requested transaction exists as identified in the corresponding
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive,
.I REMADDR_length
and
.I REMADDR_offset
fields will be populated to reflect the remote association address for the specified transaction.
.
