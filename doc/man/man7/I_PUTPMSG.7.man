.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B I_PUTPMSG
provides an
.BR ioctl (2s)
emulation of the
.BR putmsg (2)
and
.BR putpmsg (2s)
system calls.
.B I_PUTPMSG
is emulated in this way due to the
.B Linux
kernel's failure to provide any means to implement standard system calls.
.PP
Under the emulation,
.I fd
is the same as the
.I fd
argument to
.BR putmsg (2)
or
.BR putpmsg 92s);
.I arg
points to a structure containing the remaining arguments for
.BR putmsg (2)
and
.BR putpmsg (2s).
.I cmd
is always
.BR I_PUTPMSG .
.PP
See
.BR putmsg (2)
and
.BR putpmsg (2s)
for the purpose and function of the arguments.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B I_PUTPMSG
input-ouput control is not intended to be invoked directly with the
.BR ioctl (2s)
interface by the user, but rather via the
.BR putmsg (2)
and
.BR putpmsg (2s)
library calls.
.PP
See
.BR putmsg (2)
and
.BR putpmsg (2s)
for details ont he operation of the the system call this
.BR ioctl (2s)
emulates, and usage information.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success, the
.B I_PUTPMSG
.BR ioctl (2s)
command returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
upon failure, minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When the
.B I_PUTPMSG
.BR ioctl (2s)
command fails, it returns minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to one of the following errors:
.TP \w'[EWOULDBLOCK]\(em'u
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
The stream head is set for non-blocking operation and
.BR putpmsg ()
would block: that is, the message is being sent with
.I flags
set to
.B MSG_BAND
and the corresponding
.I band
is flow controlled.

.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I fd
refers to a stream that is linked under a
.I STREAMS

resources were insufficient to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSTR ]
.I fd
refers to a device that has no stream associated with it.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
A
.B M_HANGUP
message arrived at the stream head for the specified
.IR fd .
.TP
.RB [ ERANGE ]
The
.I len
of the data part of the message is outside the range
.I q_minpsz
to
.I q_maxpsz
inclusive for the topmost
.I STREAMS
module or driver under the stream head, or,
the
.I len
of the control or data part is larger than the maximum sized control or data
message for the
.I STREAMS
subsystem.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSYS ]
The
.BR putpmsg ()
system call is not supported on your system.  The occurs when
.I STREAMS
is not
loaded or you have linked the wrong library.
.PP
Other errors may be returned by
.BR putpmsg ().
If the protocol module sends an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message to the stream head, the error returned on all subsequent write
operations, including
.BR putpmsg (),
is specified in the
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message by the protocol module.  Which errors are returned under what
conditions form part of the necessary documentation of the protocol module.

(This error is not normally returned to user level programs.)
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I fd

linked under a multiplexing driver, all
.BR ioctl (2s)

.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message) from the module or driver.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
a message block could not be allocated during the operation and the operation
is not permitted to block.
Under some circumstances, an
.BR ioctl (2s)
command will block awaiting the availability of message blocks, regardless of the setting of
.BR O_NDELAY " or " O_NONBLOCK .

message can be returned in
.IR errno (3).

procedures, as is the case for
.BR I_PUSH (7),
.BR I_POP (7),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
or
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
an error number returned by the module or driver
.BR qopen "(9) or " qclose (9)
procedure can also be returned in
.IR errno (3).

message from the module or driver in response to an

message issued for an
