.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B AP_RO_REJECTP_IND
primitive is used with 
.BR ap_rcv (3)
and XAP-ROSE environment to indicate the ROSE provider has detected a problem
with a previous request.  This request can also be identified by the returned
invoke id.
.TP \w'\fIaperrno_p\fP\(em'u
.I fd
This integer value refers to the descriptor returned from a previous
.BR ap_open (3)
call.  It identifies the library instance that supports the association.
.TP
.I sptype
The value pointed to will be set to
.BR AP_RO_REJECTP_IND .

.I cdata->pci
The
.I cdata->pci
argument will be set to the value of the presentation context id encoded within
the presentation data value which contained the ROSE PDU.
.TP
.IR cdata->type
A reject code will inclode two parts, a
.IR type ,
and a
.IR rsn .
.I type
will be
.BR AP_RO_GENERAL_TYPE .
Values for both
.IR type " and " rsn
are defined in the header file
.RB < xap_rose.h >.

\fIrsn\fP == \fBAP_RO_RETURN_PARM\fP.  Returned parameter information will never
be present for other reject reasons.

The returned parameter information, if present, will contain the structure
pointed to by the
