.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests that the CCS provider make a call to the specified
destination.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_SETUP_REQ .
.TP
.I cc_user_ref
Specifies a reference number known to the CCS user that uniquely identifies
the current setup request.  When this value is non-zero, it permits the CCS
User to have multiple outstanding setup requests pending on the same stream.
Responses made by the CCS provider to the
.B CC_SETUP_REQ
primitive will contain this CCS user call attempt reference.
.TP
.I cc_call_type
Specifies the type of call to be set up.  Call types supported are dependent
upon the CCS provider and protocol, see
.IR \*(lqNOTES\*(rq ", below, "
for call types for specific protocols.
.TP
.I cc_call_flags
Specifies a bit field of call options.  Call flags supported are dependent
upon the CCS provider and protocol, see
.IR \*(lqNOTES\*(rq ", below, "
call flags for specific protocols.
.TP
.I cc_cdpn_length
Specifies the length of the called party number parameter that conveys an
address identifying the CCS user to which the call is to be established.  This
field will accommodate variable length numbers within a range supported by the
CCS provider.  If no called party number is provided by the CCS user, this
field must be coded to zero.  The coding of the called party number is
protocol and provider-specific.
.TP
.I cc_cdpn_offset
Is the offset of the called party number from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.TP
.I cc_opt_length
Specifies the length of optional parameters to be conveyed in the call setup.
This field will accomodate variable length addresses within a range supported
by the CCS provider.  If no optional parameters are provided by the CCS user,
this field must be coded to zero.  The format of optional parameters are
protocol and provider-specific, see
.IR \*(lqNOTES\*(rq ", below, "
the format of optional parameters for specific protocols.
.TP
.I cc_opt_offset
Specifies the offset of the optional parameters from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.TP
.I cc_addr_length
Specifies the length of the call control address parameter that conveys the
call control address (circuit, circuit group) of the CCS user entity to which
the call is to be established.  The semantics of the values in the
.B CC_SETUP_REQ
is identical to the values in the
.BR CC_BIND_REQ .
.TP
.I cc_addr_offset
Specifies the offset of the call control address from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The following rules apply to the setup of calls to the specified addresses:
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em 4
If the
.I cc_cdpn_length
field in the
.B CC_SETUP_REQ
primitive is zero, then the CCS provider is to
select a called party number for the call.  If the CCS provider cannot select
a called party number for the call, the CCS provider responds with a
.BR CC_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive with error
.RB [ CCNOADDR ].
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
If the
.I cc_cdpn_length
field in the
.B CC_SETUP_REQ
primitive is non-zero, the CCS provider is to setup
the call to the specified number.  If the CCS provider cannot setup a call of
the specified call type to the specified number the call will fail and the CCS
provider will return a
.BR CC_ERROR_ACK (7)
with the appropriate error value (e.g.,
.RB [ CCBADADDR ]).
.\"
.\"
.PP
The following rules apply to the call control addresses (trunk groups and
circuit identifiers):
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em 4
If the CCS user does not specify a call control address (i.e.
.I cc_addr_length
is set to zero), then the CCS provider may attempt to assign a call control
address, assign it a call reference and associate it with the stream for the
duration of the call.
.\"
.\"
.PP
The following rules apply to the CCS user call attempt reference:
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em 4
If the CCS user does not specify a call attempt reference (i.e. the
.I cc_user_ref
is set to zero), then the CCS provider can only support one outstanding
outgoing call attempt for the stream.
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
If the CCS user wishes to setup multiple outgoing calls on the same stream,
the CCS user associates a user call reference with each of the setup requests
so that the indication, confirmation and acknolwedgement primitives can be
associated with the specific call setup request.
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
If the CCS user specifies a call
attempt reference, all replies made by the CCS provider to this
.B CC_SETUP_REQ
primitive will contain the CCS user specified call attempt reference until
either the call fails or is released, or after the CCS provider sends a
.BR CC_SETUP_CON (7)
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
User call references are only necessary if multiple outgoing calls are to be
setup at the same time.
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
User call references only need by valid until a setup confirmation,  call
reattempt indication, release indication or call failure indication has been
received in response to the setup request.  A setup confirmation will contain
a CCS provider call reference which can be used to distinguish the call from
other calls to the CCS provider after setup confirmation.
.\"
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is valid in state
.BR CCS_IDLE .
The new state depends upon the information provided in the
.B CC_SETUP_REQ
message as follows:
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em 4
If the setup request specifies that a continuity check was performed on a
previous circuit, the new state is
.B CCS_WREQ_CCREP
(awaiting report of the result of continuity test performed on the previous
circuit).
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
If the setup request specifies that a continuity check is required on the
circuit, the new state is
.B CCS_WIND_CTEST
(awaiting indication of remote loop back on the circuit).
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
If the setup request specifies that no continuity test is required on this or
a previous circuit and that the called party number contains partial
information, the new state is
.B CCS_WIND_MORE
(awaiting the indication that more information is required).
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
If the setup request specifies that no continuity test is required on this or
a previous circuit and that the called party number contains complete
information, the new state is
.B CCS_WCON_SREQ
(awaiting confirmation of the setup request).
.\"
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is valid in all modes.
.\"
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is originated by the CC User.
.\"
.\"
.SH ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
.PP
The following acknowledgments are valid for this primitive:
.HP
.IR "Successful Call Establishment" :
This is indicated via the
.BR CC_SETUP_CON (7)
primitive.  This results in the Call Establishment state.  For
.B CC_SETUP_REQ
primitives where
.B ISUP_NCI_CONT_CHECK_REQUIRED
is set, or where the CCS provider otherwise determines that a continuity check
is required on the circuit, success is still indicated via the
.BR CC_SETUP_CON (7)
primitive.  In this case, the
.BR CC_SETUP_CON (7)
primitive is not sent by the CCS provider unless the continuity check is
successful.  For
.B CCS_SETUP primitives where
.B ISUP_NCI_CONT_CHECK_PREVIOUS
is set, the
.BR CC_SETUP_CON (7)
primitive is not sent by the CCS provider until the CCS user sends a
.BR CC_CONT_REPORT_REQ (7)
primitive indicating that continuity check on the previous circuit has been
successful.  Receipt of the
.BR CC_SETUP_CON (7)
primitive always results in the Call Establishment state.
.HP
.IR "Unsuccessful Call Establishment" :
This is indicated via the
.BR CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND "(7), " CC_CALL_FAILURE_IND "(7) or " CC_RELEASE_IND (7)
primitives.  For example, a call may be rejected because either the called CCS
user cannot be reached, or the CCS provider and/or the called CCS user did not
agree on the specified call type or options.  This results in the Idle state.
Where the
.BR CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND "(7) or " CC_RELEASE_IND (7)
primitives are sent before the
.BR CC_SETUP_CON (7)
primitive, the
.BR CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND "(7) or " CC_RELEASE_IND (7)
primitives will contain the CCS user specified call attempt reference.
.HP
.IR "Non-fatal errors" :
These are indicated via the CC_ERROR_ACK primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The applicable non-fatal errors are defined as follows:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.RB [ CCSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the UNIX system eror is indicated in the
.BR CC_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.TP
.RB [ CCOUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADADDR ]
The call control address as specified in the primitive was in an incorrect
format, or the address contained illegal information.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADDIGS ]
The called party number was in the incorrect format, or contained illegal
information.  This is used only to handle coding errors of the number and is
not intended to provide for protocol errors.  Protocol errors should be
conveyed in the
.BR CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND "(7), " CC_CALL_FAILURE_IND "(7) or " CC_RELEASE_IND (7)
primitives.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADOPT ]
The optional parameters were in an incorrect format, or contained illegal
information.
.TP
.RB [ CCNOADDR ]
The user did not provide a called party number field and one was required by
the call type.  The CCS provider could not select a called party number.
.TP
.RB [ CCADDRBUSY ]
The CCS provider could not use the specified address because the specified
address is already in use.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADCLR ]
The call reference specified in the primitive was incorrect or illegal (not
unique).
.TP
.RB [ CCBADPRIM ]
The primitive was of an incorrect format (i.e. too small, or an offset is out
of range).
.TP
.RB [ CCACCESS ]
The user did not have proper permissions for the use of the requested address
or options.
