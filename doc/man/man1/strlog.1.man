.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B strlog
is a shell script interface to the
.IR STREAMS -based
logger,
.BR strlog (4).
.B strlog
accepts messages on the command line
.RI ( message )
or from
.I file
using the
.B -f
option, and delivers those messages to the
.I STREAMS
logger,
.BR strlog (4).
The
.BR -M " and " -S
options can be used to set the
.I STREAMS
module identifier,
.IR mid ,
and unit identifier,
.IR sid .
These identifiers, once set, are applicable to all messages logged.
The
.B -p
option can be used to set the logging
.I facility
and
.I level
as described below.
The priority, once set, is applicable to all messages logged.
.PP
Normally,
.B strlog
generates a message and passes it to the
.I STREAMS
logger,
using the
.BR putmsg (2)
interface to the log driver,
.BR strlog (4).
Using the
.B -s
option, the user can request that the message be formatted and logged to standard error,
.IR stderr ,
as well as the
.I STREAMS
logger.
.PP
The
.BR -t ", " -i ", " -u " and " -d
options are provided for compatibility with
.BR logger (1),
and are ignored.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB-M\fR, \fB--mid\fR \fImid\fR
Specifies the module identifier,
.IR mid ,
to be included in the
.I STREAMS
log.  If this option is not present, the
.I mid
defaults to zero
.RB ( 0 ).
The value of
.IR mid ,
specified last with this option (or by default) applies to all messages specified on the command
line, contained in
.IR file ,
or read from
.IR stdin .
.TP
\fB-S\fR, \fB--sid\fR \fIsid\fR
Specifies the unit identifier,
.IR sid ,
to be included in the
.I STREAMS
log.  If this option is not present, the
.I sid
defaults to zero
.RB ( 0 ).
The value of
.IR sid ,
specified last with this option (or by default) applies to all messages specified on the command
line, contained in
.IR file ,
or read from
.IR stdin .
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--priority\fR \fIpriority\fR
Specify the concatenated system log facility and level for the log message.
.I priority
can either be specified as a numeric value, or as a symbolic name using a dot notation:
.IR facility . level .
If this option is not specified,
.I priority
defaults to
.BR user . info .
The value of
.IR priority ,
specified last with this option (or by default) applies to all messages specified on the command
line, contained in
.IR file ,
or read from
.IR stdin .
.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--file\fR \fIfile\fR
Provided for compatibility with
.BR logger (1);
when this option is specified, any
.I message
arguments are ingored and logger input is taken from
.IR file .
If
.I file
is
.RB \(lq - \(rq,
then
.I stdin
is read instead of a file.
Each line of input read from
.I file
is treated as a separate
.I message
and a separate invocation of
.BR strlog .
That is, each line of the input is formatted and passed to the
.I STREAMS
logger in the same fashion as though each line of input were specified as the
.I message
string argument to a separate
.B strlog
command.
The
.IR mid ", " sid " and " priority
specified on the command line (or arrived at by default) are applied to each line of the input.
.TP
\fB-s\fR, \fB--stderr\fR
Provided for compatibility with
.BR logger (1);
this option causes the output to also be written to
.IR stderr ,
in a format similar to that provided by the
.I STREAMS
.BR strace (8)
and
.BR strerr (8)
loggers.
See
.BR strace (8)
and
.BR strerr (8)
for a description of those formats.
.TP
\fB-t\fR, \fB--tag\fR \fItag\fR
Provided for compatibility with
.BR logger (1);
this option is ignored.
.TP
\fB-i\fR, \fB--id\fR
Provided for compatibility with
.BR logger (1);
this option is ignored.
.TP
\fB-u\fR, \fB--socket\fR \fIdevice\fR
Provided for compatibility with
.BR logger (1);
this option is ignored.
.TP
\fB-d\fR, \fB--datagram\fR
Provided for compatibility with
.BR logger (1);
this option is ignored.
.TP
\fB-D\fR, \fB--debug\fR [\fIlevel\fR]
Increases or sets to \fIlevel\fR the debug verbosity, typically for debugging purposes.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR [\fIlevel\fR]
Increases or sets to \fIlevel\fR the output verbosity, typically for diagnostic purposes.
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Suppresses normal output.
(Equivalent to
.BR --verbose = 0 .)
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR, \fB-?\fR, \fB--?\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B strlog
prints usage information and then exits.  No additional option scanning or other actions are
performed.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B strlog
prints version information and then exits.  No additional option scanning or other actions are
performed.
.TP
\fB-C\fR, \fB--copying\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B strlog
prints version information and then exits.  No additional option scanning or other actions are
performed.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
\fR[\fImessage\fR \fI...\fR]
Zero or more message strings to be logged, concatentated together with a single space between them.
If no
.I message
argument is specified, and option
.B -f
is not given, then the message strings will be read from
.IR stdin .
See the description under the
.B -f
option, above.

.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B strlog
command is intended to be used with the
.IR STREAMS -based
logger.  See
.BR strlog (4).
This is most useful for trace messages associated with
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules, of which there are no counterpart in the
.B Linux
.IR BSD -based
system loggers.  Trace messages are filtered by the
.I STREAMS
logger,
.BR strlog (4)
and are collected in files using the system trace utility,
.BR strace (8).
Processes that wish to generate trace messages to the
.I STREAMS
logger should use this
.B strlog
utility.
Processes that wish to generate error messages to the
.I STREAMS
logger can use this
.B strlog
utility or the
.B Linux
.IR BSD -based
.BR logger (1)
utility.
.PP
The
.B strlog
utility is also useful for testing the
.IR STREAMS -based
logger,
.BR strlog (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
.B strlog
returns a zero
.RB ( 0 )
exit status on success, and a positive, non-zero
.RB ( >0 )
exit status on failure.
When
.B strlog
fails, it prints a diagnostic message on standard error,
.IR stderr ,
and exits with an exit status of one
.RB ( 1 )
if an internal failure occured, and an exit status of two
.RB ( 2 )
if there was an error in option syntax.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The following environment variables affect the execution of

.TP
.B LANG
Provide a default value for the i18n variables that are unset or null.  See
.BR locale (1).
.TP
.B LC_ALL
If set to a non-emtpy string, override the values of all other i18n variables.
.TP
.B LC_CTYPE
Determine the local for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
.TP
.B LC_MESSAGES
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error,
.IR stderr .
(This means diagnostic messages from
.B strlog
to the user or application, not diagnostic messages that the user is sending to the
.I STREAMS
logger.)
.TP
.B NLSPATH
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
.BR LC_MESSAGES .
