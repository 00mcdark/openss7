.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B perftest
and
.B perftestn
perform benchmark performances tests on a
.BR pipe (4).
The purpose of the
.B perftest
performance benchmark is to perform comparison tests between
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
implementations.
The purpose of the
.B perftestn
performance benchmark is to perform comparison tests between
.B Linux
native
.BR pipe (4)s
and
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)s.
.I @PACKAGE_TITLE@
also provides a
.B benchmark
test script that performs a number of benchmark runs and summarizes the results.  These performance
benchmark programs can be used for development, performance tuning and optimization, and validation
testing.
See the
.I @PACKAGE_TITLE@ Installation and Reference Manual
for more information on how to invoke the
.B autotest
test suites.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.BR perftest " and " perftestn
options fall into several categories as detailed in the subsections below.  If
.BR perftest " or " perftestn
are executed without any options, they will execute the default benchmark test and report the progress
and results of the test.
.SS Command Options
.PP
These command options determine whether a benchmark is run or whether an informative function is
performed instead.  If none of these command options are specified, then it is assumed that the
benchmark is to be executed.
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
When this option is encountered,
print usage information to
.I stdout
and exit.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.
.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
When this option is encountered,
print version information to
.I stdout
and exit.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.
.TP
\fB-C\fP, \fB--copying\fP
When this option is encountered,
print copying information to
.I stdout
and exit.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.
.SS General Options
.PP
The following options are applicable to all command options.  For other than test case command
options, these general options must appear ahead of the command option.
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Specifies that the caller is interested only in the return code and error diagnostics and that
normal output should be suppressed.
The default verbosity level if this option is not specified is
.RB ( 1 ).
This option is equivalent to
.BR --verbose=0 .
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR [\fILEVEL\fR]
Increases or sets the verbosity level.  When this option is given without the
.I LEVEL
argument, it specifies that the verbosity level should be increased by one.  If the
.I LEVEL
argument is specified, the verbosity level is set to that integer value.  This option can be
repeated.
The default verbosity level if this option is not specified is
.RB ( 1 ).
For example,
.B -vvvv
is equivalent to
.BR --verbose=5 .
.SS Test Options
.PP
The following options are only applicable if a benchmark run is in effect.
That is, these options are only effective if the benchmark run is executed and are used to modify
the manner in which benchmark is executed or results reported.
.TP
\fB--hiwat\fP[=]\fIHIWAT\fP
By default the read high water mark on the Stream head is
.RI { STRHIGH }
which is typically 5120 bytes.  This option sets the Stream head read-side
high water mark to
.IR HIWAT .
.IP ""
This option is only applicable to STREAMS-based pipes and FIFOs and is only
supported by
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.TP
\fB--lowat\fP[=]\fILOWAT\fP
By default the read low water mark on the Stream head is
.RI { STRLOW }
which is typically 1024 bytes.  This option sets the Stream head read-side
low water mark to
.IR LOWAT .
.IP ""
This option is only applicable to STREAMS-based pipes and FIFOs and is only
supported by
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.TP
\fB-M\fP, \fB--mread\fP
Normally read notification on the Stream head is disabled.  This option
enables read notifications on the Stream head.
This option is only applicable to STREAMS-based pipes and FIFOs and is only
supported by
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.TP
\fB-w\fP, \fB--readfill\fP
Normally pipes and FIFOs have read mode set to normal (byte-mode).  This
option sets the Stream head to read-fill mode (the reader always blocks
awaiting a full buffer regardless of the blocking setting of the file
descriptor).
.IP ""
This option is only applicable to STREAMS-based pipes and FIFOs and is only
supported by
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.TP
\fB-R\fP, \fB--niceread\fP
When performing asynchronous testing, the read child will be set nice 19.
.TP
\fB-S\fP, \fB--nicesend\fP
When performing asynchronous testing, the write child will be set nice 19.
.TP
\fB-F\fP, \fB--full\fP
Normally the same number of bytes written per write operation will also be
specified to the read operation.  This option causes the read operation to
request a full
.IR { PIPE_BUF }
read.
.TP
\fB-H\fP, \fB--hold\fP
This option is only applicable to STREAMS-based pipes and FIFOs and is only
supported by
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.TP
\fB-a\fP, \fB--async\fP
By default, the benchmark testing will use a single process to write to the write-side of the
.I pipe
and read from the read-side of the
.I pipe
in a synchronous fashion.  Synchronous testing provides more predictable and repeatable results.
When the
.B -a
option is specified,
.BR perftest " and " perftestn
will spawn two child processes, one which writes to the write-side of the
.I pipe
and one which reads from the read-side of the pipe.  Although higher throughputs are acheivable
using asyncrhonous processes in this fashion, it is sometimes more a test of the
.B Linux
scheduler than the underlying
.I pipe
implementation.
.TP
\fB-f\fP, \fB--fifo\fP
Use a STREAMS-based FIFO for testing instead of a STREAMS-based pipe.
.TP
\fB-m\fP, \fB--module\fP[=]\fIMODNAME\fP
Specifies the name of a module to push on the write-side of the pipe.  The default is
.RB \(lq pipemod \(rq.
Other useful choices are
.RB \(lq nullmod \(rq
and
.RB \(lq srvmod \(rq.
.TP
\fB-p\fP, \fB--push\fP[=][\fICOUNT\fP]
Specifies the number of instances of
.I MODNAME
(as specified with the
.B -m
option) to push on the write-side of the
.IR pipe .
If
.I COUNT
is not given, the number of instances is incremented.
If
.I COUNT
is specified, the number of instances is set to
.IR COUNT .
The default number of instances is zero
.RB ( 0 ),
i.e, do not push any modules.
.TP
\fB-b\fP, \fB--blocking\fP
Normally the test is peformed with non-blocking operation on both sides of the
.IR pipe .
When non-blocking operation is used in syncrhonous mode, writes are performed to the write-side of
the
.I pipe
until
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
is returned and then reads are performed from the read-side of the
.I pipe
until
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
is returned and so on.  When the
.B -b
option is specified, blocking operation is used, and a single blocking write is performed to the
write-side of the
.I pipe
and then a single blocking read is performed from the read-side of the
.IR pipe .
Non-blocking synchronous operation has the effect that queues are filled with writes until flow
control exists before being emptied with reads.  Blocking synchronous operation has the effect that
a single message is passed from module to module to be read by the other end, and queues are left empty.
These two effects can be used to test the message passing performance of a chain of modules or the
queuing, enabling and back-enabling performance of a chain of modules.
.TP
\fB-s\fP, \fB--size\fP[=][\fIMSGSIZE\fP]
Specifies the message size,
.IR MSGSIZE ,
for each read and write.  The default is
.BR 64 bytes.
.TP
\fB-r\fP, \fB--readwrite\fP
By default, the benchmark tests are performed using
.BR getpmsg (2s)
and
.BR putpmsg (2s).
When the
.B -r
option is specified,
.BR read (2s)
and
.BR write (2s)
will be used instead.  (Note that this is the default for
.B Linux
native
.I pipe
testing, which does not support the
.BR getpmsg (2s)
or
.BR putpmsg (2s)
system calls.)
.TP
\fB-t\fP, \fB--time\fP[=][\fIREPORT\fP]
Specifies the reporting interval.  The default is
.B 1
second.
.TP
\fB-i\fP, \fB--iterations\fP[=]\fIITERATIONS\fP
Normally the program will continue to operate, reporting each interval, until
terminated by the controlling terminal.  This option causes the program to
terminate after
.IR ITERATIONS .
