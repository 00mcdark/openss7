.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B m2uasconf
is a configuration utility for the M2UA-AS multiplexing driver,
.BR m2ua-as (4).
Its purpose is to open SCTP Streams, link them under the M2UA-AS driver, and configure them using
M2UA-AS driver input-output controls.
.PP
The
.B m2uasconf
utility is intended to be run at system startup from a System V init script, or when reconfiguration
of the M2UA-AS driver is necessary.  The utility can also be used to display the configuration of
the M2UA-AS driver at any time.  Once configuration of the M2UA-AS multiplexing driver is complete,
application programs (SL-Users) can open, attach, enable and use Signalling Link streams opened on
the driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B M2UAASCONF
provides the following command-line options:
.SS "Command Options"
.PP
One of the following mutually exclusive command options must be specified.  If no command options
are specified,
.B M2UAASCONF
will behave as though the
.B -l
option was specified and list the full configuration for the M2UA-AS driver.
.TP
[[\fB-l\fR, \fB--list\fR] [\fISGID\fR [\fI...\fR]]]
List the configuration information associated with a specified set of SGs, or list the configuration
information fo all SGs (if no arguments are specified).  The information is displayed in the same
format as contained in the
.BR m2uaasconf
configuration file.  This option can be used to obtain information about specific M2UA-AS SGs, as
well as providing the ability to regenerate the M2UA-AS entries in the
.BR m2uaasconf
configuration file.
.RS
.PP
Arguments consist of a whitespace separated list of SG identifiers.  Each SG identifier can consist
of a number (specifying the local integer SG identifier) or an ASCII string (specifying the global
SG Common Language Equipment Identifier).  When arguments are specified, the configuration
associated with the SG identified by each argument is listed.  When no arguments are specified, the
configuration for all SGs are listed.
.PP
The output format is one line per SG or Key entry and is consistent with the file format described
under
.RI \(lq "FILE FORMAT" \(rq,
below.
The
.B -o
option can be used to regenerate the configuration file.
.RE
.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fB--add\fR {[\fBsg\fR]|\fBkey\fR} \fISGID\fR \fIarguments\fR \fI...\fR
Add an SG or Key configuration entry.  The format of the arguments are the same as for the
.B sg
or
.B key
entry in the configuraion file.
The argument format is consistent with the file format described under
.RI \(lq "FILE FORMAT" \(rq,
below.
The entry must not overlap with an existing entry or an error will result.
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--cha\fR {[\fBsg\fR]|\fBkey\fR} \fISGID\fR \fIarguments\fR \fI...\fR
Change an SG or Key configuration entry.  The format of the arguments are the same as for the
.B sg
or
.B key
entry in the configuration file.
The argument format is consistent with the file format described uder
.RI \(lq "FILE FORMAT" \(rq,
below.
The entry must uniquely identify an existing entry to alter or an error will result.
.TP
\fB-d\fR, \fB--del\fR {[\fBsg\fR]|\fBkey\fR} \fISGID\fR [\fIarguments\fR \fI...\fR]
Remove an SG or Key configuration entry.  The format of the arguments are the same as for the
.B sg
or
.B key
entry in the configuration file; however, only a sufficient number of arguments necessary to
uniquely identify the entry are necessary.  Therefore, an SG entry can be deleted by specifying only
the
.IR sgid .
Additional arguments are normally necessary to uniquely identify a Key entry for deletion.
If the entry does not exist or cannot be uniquely identified, an error will result.
.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--file\fR [\fIFILENAME\fR]
Create SG and Key configuration entries using the configuration file,
.IR FILENAME ,
or, if
.I FILENAME
is not specified, the default configuration file.  The default configuration file depends on the
Linux distribution, but is normally
.BR /etc/sysconf/m2uaasconf .
Entries in the file are processed line by line and are added to the configuration as though the
.B --add
option were specified with the entry line fields as arguments.
.RS
.PP
See
.RI \(lq "FILE FORMAT" \(rq,
below, for a description of the configuration file format.
.RE
.PP
The following command options are common to all OpenSS7 project command line utilities:
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR, \fB-H\fR, \fB-?\fR, \fB--?\fR
When this option is encountered, print usage information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
When this option is encountered, print version information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
\fB-C\fR, \fB--copying\fR
When this option is encountered, print copying information to
.I stdout
and exit.

When the
\fB-f\fP, \fB--file\fP [\fIFILENAME\fP]
option is specified, the supplied file contains M2UA-AS configuration entries as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Each line in the file contains one entry or comment per line.
.IP \(bu
Each entry consists of a number of fields separated by whitespace.
.IP \(bu
Any field that begins with an octothorpe character,
.RB ` # ',
is a comment that continues to the end of the line.
.IP \(bu
Any line containing only a comment (beginning with optional whitespace followed by an octothorpe
character,
.RB ` # ')
is ignored.
.IP \(bu
Blank lines are ignored.
.PP
Each line containing an M2UA-AS configuration entry consists of either a
.B sg
entry or a
.B key
entry.
An
.B sg
entry begins with the string
.RB \(lq sg \(rq
in the first field.
A
.B key
entry begins with the string
.RB \(lq key \(rq
in the first field.
.SS SG Configuration Entries
.PP
Each line containing an M2UA-AS SG configuration entry consists of the following fields:
.ad l
.HP \w'\fBsg\fR\ 'u
.B sg
.RI < sgid >
.RI < aspid >
.RI < local-endpoint >
.RI < remote-endpoint >
.RI < streams >
.RI < version >
.RI < options >
.ad b
.PP
Where,
.TP
.I sgid
is an SG identifier that is an integer number locally identifying an ASP-SG relation (i.e. SCTP
association), or a Common Language Equipment Identifier used to globally identify the remote SG.
When both an integer and CLEI SG identifier are specified, they are separated by a comma with no
intervening withspace.
.TP
.I aspid
is an ASP Identifier that will be used in the ASP Up request to the SG.  If this field is specified
as a single dash,
.RB ( - ),
then no ASP Identifier will be used in the ASP Up request to the SG.
This field may also contain a Common Language Equipment Identifier used to globally identify the
ASP.  When both an integer and CLEI ASP identifier are specified, they are separated by a common
with no intervening whitespace.
.TP
.I local-endpoint
is the local endpoint address to which the SCTP association is bound to communicate with the remote
SG.  This can take the form:
{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}[\fB,\fR{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}][\fB:\fR{\fIport\fR|\fIservice\fR}].
The special hostname consisting of a single star,
.RB ( * ),
can be used to indicate a wildcard address.  When the wildcard address is used, only one
.IR hostname " or " ipaddress
can occur in the address.  If the
.IR port " or " service
is not specified, then a dynamic port number will be allocated.  If the
.I service
is specified as
.RB \(lq m2ua ,\(rq
then the M2UA registered (well-known) port number will be used.
.TP
.I remote-endpoint
is the remote endpoint address to which the SCTP association is connected to communicate with the
remote SG.  This can take the form:
{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}[\fB,\fR{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}][\fB:\fR{\fIport\fR|\fIservice\fR}].
If the
.IR port " or " service
is not specified, the M2UA registered (well-known) port number will be used.
.TP
.I streams
is the number of SCTP data streams that will be requested on connection with this SG.
.TP
.I version
is the version of the M2UA protocol that is supported by this SG.  The field can be a single dash
.RB ( - ),
indicating that the default is to be used; otherwise, one of the following values.
.RS
.TP
.B rfc3331
the SG supports Version 1 of the M2UA protocol as specified in RFC 3331.
.[
rfc3331
.]
.TP
.B ts102141
the SG supports Version 1 of the M2UA protocol as specified in RFC 3331 and modified by ETSI TS 102
141.
.[
ts 102 141

.RE
.TP
.I options
is a list of comma-separated SG options, with no embedded whitespace.  Which defined options are
valid might depend upon the setting of
.IR version ,
above.  Options that are undefined or unsupported for a given
.I version
are ignored.  When no options are specified, this filed contains a single dash
.RB ( - ).
The following options are defined:
.RS
.TP
.B dynamic
When included in the options, this keyword specifies that the SG requires dynamic configuration
(registration).  If this option is not included, the SG requires static configuration (no
registration).

The
.B m2uaasconf
utility, reads this configuration file and performs the following steps for each entry in the file:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The
.B m2uaasconf
utility opens an SCTP association by opening the
.B /dev/sctp_t
device, or the device specified with the
.B -s
option.
.IP 2.
The
.B m2uaasconf
utility opens a stream on the M2UA-AS driver using the
.B /dev/m2ua-as
device, or the device specified by the
.B -e
option, and links the SCTP stream under the M2UA-AS multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
input-output control.
The
.B m2uaasconf
utility can then close the file descriptor for the SCTP stream.
.IP 3.
The
.B m2uaasconf
utility uses the
.B M2UA_AS_IOCSCONFIG
input-output control to associated the lower multiplex SCTP stream with an ASP-SG relation.  The
input-output control takes the information provided in the configuration file line entry, and the
multiplexer identifier returned from the
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
input-output control operation.  The M2UA-AS driver, in response to the
.B M2UA_AS_IOCSCONFIG
input-output control, complets the ASP-SG relation information as part of the lower multiplex stream
private structure.  The M2UA-AS driver also binds and connects the SCTP association and attempts to
bring the ASP to the ASP Up state with the remote SG.
.IP 4.
Steps 1 thorugh 3, above, are repeated for each entry in the configuration file.
.IP 5.
The utility can also open and attach signalling links streams and link them under the SL-MUX
multiplexing driver with a global PPA and CLEI.
