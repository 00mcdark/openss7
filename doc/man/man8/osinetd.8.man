.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B osinetd
is a user-space C-language program that can be run in the background as a
daemon process to establish, initialize, configure and collect statistics and
events from
.I @PACKAGE_TITLE@ .
But, see
.RI \(lq NOTICES \(rq.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.SS Command Options
.PP
The following command options determine the mode of the command and are
mutually exclusive options:
.TP
\fB-n\fP, \fB--nodaemon\fP
Specifies that the
.B ss7statsd
is to run in the foreground with output to standard out and errors to standard
error (unless overridden by options).  This is the default when \fB--debug\fP
is specified.  Otherwise,
.B ss7statsd
normally closes standard input, output and error and places itself in the
background as a daemon process, reading configuraiton from the configuration
file, sending output to the output file, and sending errors to the log file.
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB-?\fP, \fB--?\fP, \fB--help\fP
When this option is encountered, print usage information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
When this option is encountered, print version information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
\fB-C\fP, \fB--copying\fP
When this option is encountered, print copying information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.SS Configuration Options
.PP
.SS Daemon Options
.PP
The following options are useful in daemon mode to redirect standard output to
an output file and standard error to a log file.
.TP
\fB-i\fP, \fB--interval\fP \fIINTERVAL\fP
.TP
\fB-O\fP, \fB--outpdir\fP \fIDIRECTORY\fP
When run in the daemon mode, specifies the directory,
.IR DIRECTORY ,
in which output and error files will be opened.  The default output directory is
.IR \(lq /var/tmp/ss7statsd \(rq.
.TP
\fB-o\fP, \fB--outfile\fP \fIFILENAME\fP
When run in daemon mode, specifies the output filename,
.IR FILENAME .
The default output filename is the process name concatenated with a
.RB \(lq .out \(rq
suffix.
.TP
\fB-l\fP, \fB--logfile\fP \fIFILENAME\fP
When run in daemon mode, specifies the errors filename,
.IR FILENAME .
The default errors filename is the process name concatenated with a
.RB \(lq .err \(rq
suffix.
.TP
\fB-f\fP, \fB--cfgfile\fP \fIFILENAME\fP
Not implemented.
.SS General Options
.PP
The following are general options controlling the output of the utilily and
can be applied to the command in any mode:
.TP
\fB-q\fP, \fB--quiet\fP
Specifies that the caller is interested only  in the return code and that
normal output should be suppressed.  This option is equivalent to
.BR --verbose = 0 .
.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--debug\fP \fILEVEL\fP
Increases or set the debugging level.  When this option is given without the
.I LEVEL
argument, it specifies that the debugging level should be increased by one.  If the
.I LEVEL
argument is specified, the debuggin level is set to that integer value.  This option can be
repeated.  For example,
.B -ddddd
is equivalent to
.BR --debug = 5 .
The default debugging level is zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.TP
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP \fILEVEL\fP
Increases or sets the output verbosity level.  When this option is given without the
.I LEVEL
argument, it specifies that the output verbosity level should be increased by one.  If the
.I LEVEL
argument is specified, the verbosity level is set to that integer value.  This option can be
repeated.  For example,
.B -vvvvv
is equivalent to
.BR --verbose = 5 .
The default output verbosity is one
.RB ( 1 ).

.B sys.osinet.transport.clns.tidu_size
Since the size of the TSDUs is unlimited, they might need to be divided into
TIDUs, so that the session entity can deal with them.  However, if these TIDUs
are too small, the session control PDUs are also divided.  This TIDU size
specifies the minimum size allowed for a TIDU, where the inimum size is the
specified value * 512 plus 1100.  Even if you set a TIDU size of zero, the
minimum size will be 1100.  Note that this parameter is a default value that
may be overridden by the user of the transport connection at connection time.
Sepcify a value btween 0 and 64.  The default value is 0.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.clns.acknowledgement_timer

immediately.  The default is set.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.clns.set_checksum_on_spurious_response
When set, if an invaokd TPDU is received (such as data request sent in
response to a connection request), then a checksum is included in the
responding TPDU.  The default is unset.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.clns.ignore_checksum_when_receiving
When set, this ignores the checksum when receiving TPDUs, even if checksum was
negotiated during the connection procedure.  The default is unset.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.clns.send_burst_of_tpdus_as_nudtrq
When set, allows concatenation of TPDUs into a single NSDU.  The default is
unset.
.SS Transport over CONS
.TP

4 is preferred.
.sp
If no class options are set, class 2 is selected.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.propose_class_4
Means that class 4 is proposed as the preferred class and if the remote system
accepts class 4, the transport protocol connection is established according to
class 4 transport protocol specifications.  This includes flow control and
full error control.

.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.max_multiplexing_initiator
Specifies the maximum multiplexing for locally initiated transport connections
onto a single network connection.  Specify a value between 1 and 126.  The
default value is 5 connections.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.max_multiplexing_acceptor
Specifies the maximum multiplexing for remotely initiated transport
connections onto a single network connection.  It should be a greater value
thatn the max_multiplexing_initiator control.  Specify a value between 1 and
126.  The default value is 10 connections.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.tidu_size
Since the size of the TSDUs is unlimited, they might need to be divided into
TIDUs, so that the session entity can deal with them.  However, if these TIDUs
are too small, the session control PDUs are also divided.  This TIDU size
specifies the minimum size allowed for a TIDU, where the inimum size is the
specified value * 512 plus 1100.  Even if you set a TIDU size of zero, the
minimum size will be 1100.  Note that this parameter is a default value that
may be overridden by the user of the transport connection at connection time.
Sepcify a value btween 0 and 64.  The default value is 0.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.long_nc_timeout
Specifies the inactivity timer for a network connection when: the local system
is not the initiator of the network connection, and multiplexing is being used
for the network connection.  Specify a value between 3 and 48 (decaseconds).
The default value is 24 decaseconds (240 seconds).
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.short_nc_timeout
Specifies an inactivity timer for a network connection when: the local system
initiated the network connection, and multiplexing is not being used for the
network connection.  Specify a value between 3 and 6 (decaseconds).  The
default value is 3 decaseconds (30 seconds).
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.qos_threshold_nfc
Sets a threshold for the use of flow control in the class 2 transport
protocol.  The default value of zero suppresses flow control.  A value of 8
switches flow control on.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.qos_threshold_mpx
Sets a threshold for the use of multiplexing in class 2 trasnport protocol.  A
value of zero suppresses multiplexing.  The default value is 1.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.max_size_nofc
For class 2 transport protocol, specifies a maximum limit for the receiving
queue size where no flow control has been negotiated at this level, since flow
control can be exercised at the TIDU level.  When this limit is exceeded, an
error PDU is generated.  Specify a value between 1 and 100 (2^10 bytes). The
default is 4 kbytes (4096 bytes).
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.disconnect_unused_nc
When set, disconnect an inactive network connection to allow it to be
reassigned if a new connection is required.  The default is unset.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.support_network_reset
Set to configure the local system to send an N-RESET when an error occurs and
to take the appropriate action when an N-RESET is received.  If this is set,
and the use_dr_in_case_of_error or use_dr_or_er_in_case_of_error options are
unset, then an N-RESET is sent when an error occurs.  If
support_network_reset, use_dr_in_case_of_error and
use_dr_or_er_in_case_of_eror are all unset, a disconnect request is sent.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.suppress_expedited
When set, prevents expedited data from being proposed or accepted.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.use_dr_in_case_of_error
When set, sends a disconnect request TPDU when an error occurs, according to
the type of error.  Not normally used.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.transport.cons.use_dr_or_er_in_case_of_error
When set, sends a disconnect request or error TPDU when an error occurs.  Not
normally used: some remote systems might require this option.
.SS CONS Entity
.TP
.B sys.osinet.network.cons.status
Turns the selected network entity on or off.  If you turn the entity status
off, the CONS entity is isolated, and data no longer passes through it.  You
might want to do this for debugging or security purposes.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.network.cons.default_x25_packet_size
Specifies the default packet size for an X.25 network connection.  Specify one
of: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096.  The default value is 128
octets.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.network.cons.max_nsdu_length
Specifies the maximum length allowed for a NSDU.  This value should be greater
than or equal to the maximum PDU size specified for transport.  Specify a
value between 1 and 40 (256 octet chunks).  THe default value is 8 chunks
(2048 octets).
.TP
.B sys.osinet.network.cons.connection_timer
Specifies the maximum time allowed for establishing a connection.  If the
connection is not established within the specified time, the connection
attempt is aborted.  This timer is used for all version of X.25 networks.
Specify a value between 0 and 60 (decaseconds).  The default value is 30
decaseconds (5 minutes).
.TP
.B sys.osinet.network.cons.connection_timer_x25_80
Specifies the maximum time allowed for establishing a connection in an X.25/80
(SNDCP) network.  It should be less than or equal to the connection timer
defined above.  If the connection is not established within the specified
time, the connection attempt is aborted.  Specify a value between 0 and 30
(decaseconds).  The default value is 25 decaseconds (250 seconds).
.TP
.B sys.osinet.network.cons.deconnection_timer_x25_80
Specifies the time for completion for disconnecting a network connection, in an
X.25/80 (SNDCP) network.  If the disconnection is not complete within the
specified time, the disconnection is aborted.  Specify a value between 1 and
30 (decaseconds).  The default value is 20 decaseconds (200 seconds).
.TP
.B sys.osinet.network.cons.grcb_pool_size
This is used to define the size of the routing table for the network.  It
specifies the maximum number of entries int he general routing information
table.  Specify a value between 0 and 255 (decaentries).  The default value is
3 decaentries (30 entries).  You should not need to change this value, unless
a large number of routes is required.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.network.cons.rccb_pool_size
This is used to define the routing table for the network.  It specifies the
size of the cache to be used for routes that are currently or frequently used.
Specify a value between 0 and 255 (decaentries).  The default value is 3
decaentries (30 entries).  You should not need to change this value, unless a
large number of routes is required.
.TP
.B sys.osinet.network.cons.recb_pool_size
This is used to define the routing table for the network.  It specifies the
maximum number of routes for each entry (described in the grcb_pool_size
above) in the general routing information table.  Specify a value between 0
and 255 (decaentries).  The default value is 3 decaentries (30 entries).  You
should not need to change this value, unless a large number of routes is

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
When
.B osinetd
fails, a diagnostic message is printed on standard error and a non-zero exit
status is returned.  If standard error has already been redirected to the log
file, the log file will contain the diagnostic message.
.PP
An exit status of zero
.RB ( 0 )
indicates that the command was successful; one
.BR ( 1 )
indicates that an error occured and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two
.BR ( 2 )
indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message is
printed on
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
option suppresses the printing of diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .
.PP
Also,
.B osinetd
logs notices, warnings and diagnostic error messages under facility
.I daemon
to the system log, regardless of whether it is running in the foreground or as
a daemon.  See
.BR syslog (2).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Use of a configuration daemon such as
.BR osinetd
that uses configuration files and collects statistics and events from OSI
drivers and modules and then dumps the output to files in specialized formats
is deprecated and no longer the preffered method for operational support of
the OpenSS7 OSI Stack and systems.  An SNMP/CMIP agent that provides
configuration maangement, operational measurement data collection and event
reporting is now the preferred method.
