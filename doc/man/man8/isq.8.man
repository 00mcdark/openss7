.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Displays the network entity title and SNPA address of each intermediate
system that has an entry in the CLNP routing table
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.SS Command Options
The following command options are mutually exclusive: only one command option
should be present on the command line at a time.  The exceptions are the
\fB-h\fP, \fB-V\fP and \fB-C\fP options that can be specified alone, or with
any other option.
If no option is specified, the command displays current configuration
parameters.
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
When this option is encountered, display usage information to
.IR stdout ,
stop options processing, and exit without taking further action.
.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
When this option is encountered, display version information to
.IR stdout ,
stop options processing, and exit without taking further action.
.TP
\fB-C\fP, \fB--copying\fP
When this option is encountered, display copying information to
.IR stdout ,
stop options processing, and exit without taking further action.
.\"
.SS Common Options
.PP
The following common options can be specified together with a command option.
It is not an error to specify options that are not necessary for the command
option with which they are specified.
.TP
\fB-q\fP, \fB--quiet\fP
Suppress normal output.  Only the return code of the command is of interest.
This has the same effect as \fB--verbose=0\fP.
Enables quiet mode.  Only error messages are displayed.
.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--debug\fP [\fIlevel\fP]
Specify or increase the debugging verbosity.  Sets the debugging verbosity to
\fIlevel\fP, when given, or simply increases the debuggin verbosity by one
(1) when \fIlevel\fP is not given.  This option can be repeated.
.TP
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP [\fIlevel\fP]
Specify or increase the output verbosity.  Sets the output verbosity to
\fIlevel\fP, when given, or simply increases the output verbosity by one when
\fIlevel\fP is not given.  This option can be repeated.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following is an example of the command output:
.PP
.nf
        Network entity title   SNPA address   Hold
490004000600010207010030A400 0207010030A4FE    61

.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1)
indicates that an error occurred and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates the the option or argument syntax was in error and a
diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
option suppresses the printing of normal output to
.I stdout
and diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .
.\"
.SS Error Messages
.PP
The following error messages can be generated:
.TP
.B isq: no Intermediate System table in this kernel
The OSI transport service kernel modules are not installed.  Install the
transport service kernel modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
In addition to the network entity title and SNPA address, this utility also
displays the \(lq\)hold\(rq\) time for each intermediate system.  This value
indicates in how many seconds the entry will be removed if the local system
does not receive a hello packet from the intermediate system.
.PP
The maximum number of intermediate system entries the ES-IS CLNP routing
table can hold is 8.
(Note that this is not a limitation for
.BR OpenSS7 \(tm.)
.PP
This command works only on systems that use ES-IS.
