.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These commands are client
.RB ( test-udpc )
and server
.RB ( test-udps )
programs for transferring test data between server and client.  These programs are written in the
same fashion as a pair of test programs for both
.BR tcp (7)
and
.BR udp (7)
that are documented in the
.BR test-tcpc (8),
.BR test-tcps (8),
.BR test-sctpc (8)
and
.BR test-sctps (8)
manual pages.
The purpose of this set of 6 programs is to perform comparison tests between SCTP, TCP and UDP.
.PP
When the server
.RB ( test-udps )
is started, it listens on a specified port number (or port
.B 18000
if no port number is specified) for incoming connections.  When a connection arrives, as a result of
the client
.RB ( test-udpc )
being started, the server polls for received packets and sends them back to their source.
.PP
Then the client
.RB ( test-udpc )
is started, it connects to a specified port number (or port
.B 18000
if no port number is specified) and beings sending data at a specified length as fast as possible.
.PP
Both the server
.RB ( test-udps )
and the client
.RB ( test-udpc )
report the number of bytes transmitted on an interval
.RB ( 1
second if not specified).
Both programs run continuously until they are killed.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
These commands do not take non-option arguments.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are applicable to both
.B test-udpc
and
.BR test-udps :
.TP
\fB-l\fR, \fB--loc_host\fR \fIADDRESS\fR
Specify the local host (bind address).  The default is
.BR 0.0.0.0 .
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--port\fR \fIPORTNUM\fR
Specify the port number.  For
.B test-udpc
this is the remote port number to which to connect.  For
.B test-udps
this is the local port number to which to bind.
The default is
.BR 18000 .
.TP
\fB-w\fR, \fB--length\fR \fILENGTH\fR
Specify the \fILENGTH\fR of sent messages in bytes.  The default is
.BR 64 .
.TP
\fB-t\fR, \fB--rep_time\fR \fIINTERVAL\fR
Specify the report time \fIINTERVAL\fR in seconds.  The default is
.RB ( 1 ).
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Suppress normal output.  This option is equivalent to \fB--verbose\fR=\fI0\fR.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR [\fILEVEL\fR]
Increase or set (to \fILEVEL\fR) the output verbosity.  This option may be repeated.  If not
specified, the verbosity level is
.RB ( 1 ).
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B command
displays usage information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B command
displays version information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.TP
\fB-C\fR, \fB--copying\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B command
displays copying information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.\"
.SS test-udpc Options
.PP
The following options are applicable only to
.BR test-udpc :
.TP
\fB-r\fR, \fB--rem_host\fR \fIADDRESS\fR
Specify the remote host (connect address).  The default is
.BR 127.0.0.2 .
.\"
.SS test-udps Options
.PP
The following options are applicable only to
.BR test-udps :
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
When an error occurs,
.B test-udpc
and
.B test-udps
will print a diagnostic message to
.I stderr
and exit with a non-zero exit code.
Errors result from an error of a system call on the UDP socket, or an error in the option arguments
passed to the command.  The exit status will be
.B 1
in the case of a socket error and
.B 2
in the case of a option argument error.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
These are crude programs and were only used for adhoc checkout testing.  They will be eventually
dropped from the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
release.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
At one terminal type:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
test-udps -l 127.0.0.2 -p 18000 -w 64 -n -t 5
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
to start the server program.  In another terminal type:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
test-udpc -r 127.0.0.2 -p 18000 -w 64 -n -t 5
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
Each command will display the number of bytes and messages sent and a total count of the number of
bytes and messages sent every 5 seconds.
