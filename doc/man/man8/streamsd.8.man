.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B streamsd
provides a daemon or foreground executable which provides an AgentX
.[
AgentX
.]
sub-agent implementation of the
.I OPENSS7-STREAMS-MIB
and
.I OPENSS7-STREAMS-EXT-MIB
that provide a generic management information base for
.I STREAMS
in general, and
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
specifically.
The
.I OPENSS7-STREAMS-MIB
provides management station access to
.I STREAMS
subsystem, driver and module configuration information and statistics as well
as system-wide
.I STREAMS
tunables.
The
.I OPENSS7-STREAMS-EXT-MIB
provides management stations access to the
.BR strlog (4)
logger as well as the
.BR strerr (8)
and
.BR strace (8)
capabilities.
.PP
.B streamsd
is implemented as a typical UCD-SNMP or NET-SNMP SNMP master agent or AgentX
.[
agentx
.]
sub-agent.  It is normally run as an AgentX sub-agent, with the NET-SNMP SNMP
agent daemon,
.BR snmpd (8),
running as the master agent.  Running in this manner,
.B streamsd
running as an AgentX sub-agent takes most of its default configuration from
the same configuration file as the master agent.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
Non-option arguments can be used to provide additional addresses on which an
SNMP agent or AgentX sub-agent can listen for or register for requests.  In
accordance with UCD-SNMP or NET-SNMP agent configuration.  Each address
represents an address and port combination to be listened upon by an agent, or
connected to by an AgentX subagent.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
When executed without any options,
.B streamsd
will fork twice; become its own session leader; close standard input, error
and output; begin logging to system logs; writes its daemon process id to
.BR /var/run/streamsd.pid ;
and, runs as an AgentX sub-agent.
.\"
.SS UCD-SNMP and NET-SNMP Subagent Options
.PP
The following options are compatible with NET-SNMP automatically generated
subagents.  Long options are
.BR streamsd -specific.
.\"
.TP
\fB-D\fP, \fB--debug-tokens\fP [\fITOKEN\fP[\fB,\fP\fITOKEN\fP]*]
Turns on debugging output for the specified
.IR TOKEN s.
Without any
.IR TOKEN s
specified, the default is to print all the tokens (which is also equivalent to
the keyword
.RI ' all ').
You might want to try
.RI ' all '
for extremely verbose output.  Note: You cannot put a space between the
.B -D
and the
.IR TOKEN s.
This
.B -D
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8)
and
NET-SNMP autogenerated subagents.
.\"
.TP
\fB-f\fP, \fB--dont-fork\fP, \fB-n\fP, \fB--nodaemon\fP
By default,
.B streamsd
will place itself in the background by forking twice, becoming its own session
leader, redirecting standard error to a log file, and standard output to an
output file, and close standard input.  This option causes
.B streamsd
to run in the foreground.  Errors are logged to standard error and output is
generated to standard output.  This mode is primarily for testing and works
well in conjunction with the debug and verbose options.
The
.B -f
form of this option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8)
and NET-SNMP autogenerated subagents.
.\"
.TP
\fB-L\fP, \fB--log-console\fP
Normally
.B streamsd
will open a log file to log errors and output, particularly when run as a
daemon process.  This option suppresses the opening of a log file and causes
both
.I stderr
and
.I stdout
to be sent to the controlling terminal (that is, they are not redirected).
This
.B -L
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8)
and
NET-SNMP autogenerated subagents.
.IP ""
Note that recent versions of NET-SNMP have a far more sophisticated
.B -L
option than was provided with UCD-SNMP.  Note that NET-SNMP autogenerated
subagents use this simple version, while
.BR snmpd (8)
and other NET-SNMP utility commands use the more sophisticated version.
.\"
.TP
\fB-M\fP, \fB--master\fP
By default,
.B streamsd
will attempt to run as an AgentX sub-agent.  This option will cause
.B streamsd
to run as an SNMP master agent.
Do not use this option.  Use a complete master agent and run
.B streamsd
as an AgentX sub-agent.
This
.B -M
option is for compatiblity with NET-SNMP autogenerated subagents.
.IP ""
Note that recent NET-SNMP master agents,
.BR snmpd (8),
use this option to specify the directories which will be searched for MIBs in
a fashion similar to the
.B MIBDIRS
environment variable.
.\"
.TP
\fB-M\fP, \fB--mibdirs\fP \fIMIBDIRS\fP
.\"
.TP
\fB-x\fP, \fB--agentx-socket\fP [\fISOCKET\fP]
Specifies the AgentX socket,
.IR  SOCKET ,
to which the agent will attempt to connect as an AgentX sub-agent.  This option
implies AgentX operation and overrides the
.B -M
switch.
This
.B -x
switch is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8)
and
NET-SNMP autogenerated subagents.
.\"
.SS UCD-SNMP and NET-SNMP Agent Options
.PP
The following options are compatible with NET-SNMP and UCD-SNMP agents, and in
particular,
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-a\fP, \fB--log-addresses\fP
Log addresses accessing the SNMP agent.
This
.B -a
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-A\fP, \fB--append\fP
Normally
.B streamsd
truncates existing log files when they are opened.  This option causes
.B streamsd
to append to existing log files instead of truncating them when opened.
This
.B -A
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--config-file\fP \fICONFIGFILE\fP
Normally
.B streamsd
reads the default configuration file provided for the agent (the default is
.RB \(lq streamsd.conf \(rq
in the SNMP configuration directory (usually
.RB \(lq /etc/snmp \(rq).
This option causes the full pathname
.I CONFIGFILE
to be used as the configuration file instead.
This
.B -c
option is provide for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-C\fP, \fB--config-only\fP
Normally
.B streamsd
reads some files automatically when the SNMP library is configured.  This
option causes
.B streamsd
to only read configuration files optionally specified with the
.B -c
option.  If no configuration file is specified with the
.B -c
option, no configuration files will be read when this option is specified.
That is, all configuration values will be set to their default values.
This
.B -C
option is provide for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--dump\fP
Dump send and received UDP SNMP packets.
This
.B -d
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-g\fP, \fB--gid\fP, \fB--groupid\fP \fIGID\fP
Normally
.B streamsd
runs with the real user and group id of the invoking process unless the
executable is setuid or setgid in the filesystem.  This option causes
.BR streamsd ,
after opening ports and files, to downgrade to group id,
.IR GID .
This option is effective both when
.B streamsd
is run in the foreground and as a daemon process.
This
.B -g
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-I\fP, \fB--initialize\fP [\fB-\fP][\fIMODULE\fP[\fB,\fP\fIMODULE\fP]*]
Specifies which moudles should or should not be initialized when the agent
starts up.  If the comma-separated list of
.IR MODULE s
is preceded by a '-', the
.IR MODULE s
specified represent the modules that should not be initialized when the agent
starts up; otherwise,
the
.IR MODULES s
specified represent the modules that should be initialized when the agent
starts up.
Note that the use of this option is only necessary if
.B streamsd
runs as a master agent.
This
.B -I
option is provided for compatibility with the UCD-SNMP and NET-SNMP master
agent,
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-l\fP, \fB--logfile\fP [\fILOGFILE\fP]
Output warnings, errors and messages to the log file,
.IR LOGFILE .
By default,
.I LOGFILE
is
.RB \(lq /var/log/snmpd.log \(rq.
This
.B -l
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-n\fP, \fB--name\fP \fINAME\fP
Specifies an alternative application name (which will affect the configuration
files and persistent data loaded).  By default this will be
.IR streamsd ,
regardless of the name of the actual binary executable or path to the
executable (i.e. symbolic link).
This
.B -n
option is provided for compatibility with the NET-SNMP master agent,
.BR snmpd (8).
This option should not be necessary.
.\"
.TP
\fB-p\fP, \fB--port\fP \fIPORTNUM\fP
Run on port number
.I PORTNUM
instead of the default,
.BR 161 .
This
.B -p
option is provided for compatibility with UCD-SNMP master agent,
.BR snmpd (8).
Note that recent NET-SNMP master agents use the
.B -p
option for specifying a
.IR PIDFILE ;
on these agents, the port is specified by encoding it into the address format
instead of using a command line option.
.IP ""
For compatiblity with both UCD-SNMP and NET-SNMP master agents, if the
argument to this option is a number from 1 to 16383, the argument will be
interpreted as a port number,
.IR PORTNUM .
If the value is not a number and corresponds to a path to a file which can be
created or written by the aget, the agent will interpret the argument as a
process identifier file,
.IR PIDFILE .
.\"
.TP
\fB-P\fP, \fB--pidfile\fP \fIPIDFILE\fP
When
.B streamsd
runs as a daemon (the default),
.I PIDFILE
is the full path to the file to which the daemon process id is written.  This
assists System V initscripts by helping them locate running daemons to
terminate when shutting down subsystems.   The default pidfile, unless
overridden by this option, is
.BR /var/run/streamsd.pid .
This
.B -P
option is provided for compatibility with the UCD-SNMP master agent,
.BR snmpd (8).
Note that recent versions of the NET-SNMP master agent,
.BR snmpd (8),
use the
.B -p
option (lowercase instead of uppercase 'p') for this purpose.  UCD-SNMP master
agents use the
.B -p
option to specify port numbers.  The recent NET-SNMP agents encode the port
number into the address specification for command line option and non-option
address arguments.
.\"
.TP
\fB-r\fP, \fB--noroot\fP
Normally
.B streamsd
expects to run with super-user privilege and will terminate if permission
errors occur when opening sockets or files, even if proceding is possible.
When this option is specified,
.B streamsd
does not expect to run with super-user privilege and will not terminate if
permission errors occur when opening sockets or files, providing that the
agent can still proceed and function.
This
.B -r
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-s\fP, \fB--syslog\fP
Normally
.B streamsd
logs to
.I stderr
and lets the SNMP library decide from configuration where standard error is
redirected.  This option causes
.B streamsd
to log warnnings, errors and messages to the system logs.
This
.B -s
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-T\fP, \fB--transport\fR [\fITRANSPORT\fP]
Specifies or resets the default transport mapping for the AgentX sub-agent.
When the
.I TRANSPORT
argument is not specified, the transport reverts to the default (UNIX
transport).
When specified,
.I TRANSPORT
must be one of the following transport names:
.RS
.TP
.B unix
UNIX domain socket of the SOCK_STREAM variety.
.PD 0
.TP
.B tcp
TCP socket of the SOCK_STREAM variety.
.TP
.B udp
UDP socket of the SOCK_DGRAM variety.
.PD
.RE
.IP ""
This
.B -T
option is provided for compatibiltiy with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-u\fP, \fB--uid\fP, \fB--userid\fP \fIUID\fP
Normally
.B streamsd
runs with the real user and group id of the invoking process unless th
executable is setuid or setgid in the filesystem.  This option causes
.BR streamsd ,
after opening ports and files, to downgrade to user id,
.IR UID .
This option is effective both when
.B streamsd
is run in the foreground and as a daemon process.
This
.B -u
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-U\fP, \fB--dont-remove-pidfile\fP
By default, when the daemon shuts down and a
.I PIDFILE
has been specified with the
.B -p
option, or a defualt
.I PIDFILE
is being used, the
.I PIDFILE
is removed before the daemon exits.
This
.B -U
option specifies that the master agent or AgentX sub-agent is not to remove
its
.I PIDFILE
when shutting down.
This
.B -U
option is provided for compatibility wtih the NET-SNMP master agent,
.BR snmpd (8).
This option should not be necessary, and will often cause Linux System V init
scripts to erroneously report that the daemon is dead but is pidfile exists as
though the daemon exited abnormally.
.\"
.TP
\fB-X\fP, \fB--agentx\fP
Run as an AgentX sub-agent rather than an SNMP master agent.
Note that the default behaviour of
.I streamsd
is to run as an AgentX sub-agent.  Therefore, this option has no effect unless
the
.B -M
option is also specified on the same command line.
This
.B -X
option is provided for compatibility with UCD-SNMP and NET-SNMP master agent,
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.SS STREAMSD Subagent Options
.PP
The following options are specific to the
.B streamsd
sub-agent.
.\"
.TP
\fB-k\fP, \fB--keep-open\fP
By default,
.B streamsd
will close open files and Streams between requests, causing them to be
reopened on then next request.  This is less intrusive on the STREAMS
subsystem, but is also less efficient if many closely spaced requests are
issued.  This option causes
.B streamsd
to keep Streams and files open between requests.
Note that even with this option in effect,
.B streamsd
can be made to close Streams and files by sending it a
.RI { SIGHUP }
signal.
.\"
.TP
\fB-S\fP, \fB--sysctl-file\fP \fIFILENAME\fP
When system controls are altered by the agent in such a fashion that the new
settings must persist between system reboots,
.I FILENAME
specifies the file to which the prevailing values of system controls will be
written when the agent terminates.  Entries will be written to this file in
a format suitable for use by
.BR sysctl (8)
with the
.B -p
option.
The default is the system default system
control configuration
file,
.BR "/etc/@PACKAGE_LCNAME@.conf" .
.\"
.TP
\fB-t\fP, \fB--agent-alarms\fP
By default,
.B streamsd
allows the agent library to use and intercept
.RI { SIGALRM }
signals.  When this option is set, the agent informs the SNMP library that
the agent will use and intercept
.RI { SIGALRM }
signals and that the SNMP library must use
.BR select (2)
timeouts to effect timers.
Depending on the specific version and generation of SNMP library (whether
ucd-snmp or net-snmp and the version), one or the other might work better.
See
.BR snmp_select_info (3)
and
.BR snmp_alarm (3)
for more information.

.SS General Options
.PP
General options applicable to all commands are as follows:
.\"
.TP
\fB-q\fP, \fB--quiet\fP, \fB--quick\fP
Specifies that the call is interested only in the return code and error
diagnostics and that normal output should be suppressed.  The default
verbosity level if this option is not specified is one
.RB ( 1 ).
This option is equivalent to
.BR --verbose = 0 .
This
.B -q
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
Under UCD-SNMP this option does not fully suppress normal output but
abbreviates the output into a form more suitable for machine processing.
.\"
.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--debug\fP [\fILEVEL\fP]
This
.B -d
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--verbose\fP [\fILEVEL\fP]
Increases or sets the verbosity level.  When this option is given without the
.I LEVEL
argument, it specifies that the verbosity level should be increased by one.
If the
.I LEVEL
argument is specified, the verbosity level is set to that integer value.  This
option can be repeated.  The default verbosity level if this option is not
specified is one
.RB ( 1 ).
For example,
.B -VVVV
is equivalent to
.BR --verbose = 5 .
This
.B -V
option is provided for compatibility with
.BR snmpd (8).
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero
.RB ( 0 )
indicates that the command was successful; one
.RB ( 1 )
indicates that an error occurred and a diagnostic message is printed to
.I stderr
or the log file if
.I stderr
is redirected to a log file; two
.RB ( 2 )
indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message is
printed to
.IR stderr .
.PP
Errors may result form inadequate permissions, inability to open the
.BR sad (4)
driver or push the
.BR sc (4)
module.
.\"
.\"
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The following environment variables have an effect on the behaviour of the
.B streamsd
agent:
.TP
.B SNMPCONFPATH
When this environment variable is exported to
.BR streamsd ,
the
.BR read_config_files ()
function will look for configuration and persistent data files in the paths
specified in the exported envirnoment variable (separated by colons).
If this variable is not exported to
.BR streamsd ,
the
.BR read_config_files ()
function will look for configuration and persistent data in the default
configuration and persistent data directories (in that order).
Note that configuration and persistent data will not be read when the
.B -C
option is secified, unless the configuration data and persistent data files
are also listed using the
.B -c
option.
.TP
.B SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE
When this environment variable is exported to
.BR streamsd ,
the
.BR read_config ()
functions will look for a peristent data file in the file specified in the
value of the
.B SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE
environment variable.  If this variable is not exported to
.BR streamsd ,
the
.BR read_config ()
functions will look for a persistent data in the file "streamsd.conf" in the
default persistent directory.
Note that persistent data will not be read when the
.B -C
option is specified, unless the persistent data file is also listed using the
.B -c
option.
.TP
.B HOME
When exported to
.BR streamsd ,
this environment variable specifies the home directory of the real user
associated with the executing process.  When the "$HOME/snmp/mibs" directory
exists, it will be added to the default MIB directories searched.
If this variable is not exported, no such directory is added unless it is
explicity included in the the
.B MIBDIRS
evironment variable.
The
.BR streamsd
daemon does not require MIBs to be loaded, and for the most part this
environment variable is ignored.
.TP
.B MIBDIRS
When exported to
.BR streamsd ,
this environment variable specifies the directories or directories in
addition to the default directories (when prefixed with a '+'), that will be
searched for MIBs.  If this variable is not exported to
.BR streamsd ,
only the default directories (or premib defined default directories) will be
loaded.
The
.BR streamsd
daemon does not require MIBs to be loaded, and for the most part this
environment variable is ignored.
.TP
.B MIBS
When exported to
.BR streamsd ,
this environment variable specifies the MIBs or MIBs in addition to the
default MIBs (when prefixed with a '+') or all MIBs (when "all" is specified),
that will be loaded.  If this variable is not exported to
.BR streamsd ,
only the default MIBs (or premib defined default MIBs) will be loaded.
The
.BR streamsd
daemon does not require MIBs to be loaded, and for the most part this
environment variable is ignored.
.TP
.B MIBFILES
When exported to
.BR streamsd ,
this environment variable specifies MIB files or MIB files in addition to the
default MIB files (when prefixed with a '+'), that will be loaded.  If this
variable is not exported to
.BR streamsd ,
only the default MIB files will be loaded.
The
.BR streamsd
daemon does not require MIBs to be loaded, and for the most part this
environment variable is ignored.
.TP
.B PREFIX
When exported to
.BR streamsd ,
this environment varibale specifies an OID in numbers an dots notation that
specifies the prefix of the MIB tree to be loaded.
The
.BR streamsd
daemon does not require MIBs to be loaded, and for the most part this
environment variable is ignored.
.TP
.B SUFFIX
When exported to
.BR streamsd ,
regardless of its contents,
this variable will cause only suffixes of OIDs to be output.  Otherwise, the
default is to output complete OIDs.
The
.BR streamsd
daemon does not print OIDs except for debugging, and for the most part this
environment variable is ignored.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B streamsd
AgentX sub-agent requires the
.BR sc (4)
.I STREAMS
modules and the
.BR sad (4)
.I STREAMS
driver.  If either one is not available, the
.B streamsd
command will not be successful.  See
.BR sc "(4) and " sad (4)
for more information.
.PP
.B streamsd
is normally invoked from the
.B /etc/init.d/@PACKAGE_LCNAME@
init script when the presence of an SNMP master agent providing an AgentX interface
on
.IR /var/agentx/master ,
or
.IR localhost : 705
is detected.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B streamsd
is implemented using a subset of the UCD-SNMP application programming
interfaces which are also provided in recent NET-SNMP releases (called the
old-API).  This implementation maintains compatibility across as many
distributions of NET-SNMP as possible.  Where additional NET-SNMP capabilities
are present, they are used in support of option compatibility with recent
NET-SNMP master SNMP agents, such as
.BR snmpd (8).
Consult the NET-SNMP documentation on your specific distribution for more
information.
.PP
.B streamsd
is implemented and recommended to be run as an AgentX sub-agent to a running
.BR snmpd (8)
configured for master SNMP agent operation and supporting the AgentX

.B streamsd
implements the
.I OPENSS7-STREAMS-MIB
and

SNMPv2 management information bases which provide SNMPv2c or SNMPv3 management
of the
