.TP
[{\fB-g\fP|\fB--get\fP} [{\fIAOID\fP|\fITEI\fP} [\fI...\fR]]]
Get and display the configuration information associated with a specific set of AOID or TEI, or get
and display information for all TEIs (if no arguments are specified).  The information is displayed
in the same format as contained in the
.BR tcapconf (5)
configuration file.  This option can be used to obtain information about specific TCAP entities
as well as providing the ablity to regenerate the
.B tcap
entries in the
.BR tcapconf (5)
configuration file.
(See
.RI \(lq EXAMPLES ,\(rq
below.)
.RS

information.
.TP
.I TEI

.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file format is as described in
.BR tcapconf (5),
with the additional fields defined for devices of type
.B tcap .
Signalling link specification line entries in the file consist of the following fields:
.PP
.B tcap
.RI < aoid >
.RI < global-tei >
.RI < profile >
.RI < type >
.RI < device >
.RI < modules >
.RI < version >
.RI < sdli >
.RI < sdti >
.RI < iid >
.RI < sdl-profile >
.RI < sdt-profile >
.PP
Where,
.TP
.B tcap
is the selector indicating that this is a signalling link definition entry.
.TP
.I aoid
is an Application Object Identifier (AOID) to be associated with this TCAP Entity.
.TP
.I global-ppa
is a global TCAP Entity Identifier (TEI) to be associated with this TCAP Entity.
.TP
.I profile
is a TCAP Entity protocol parameters profile used to configure this TCAP Entity.  The
profile must either be the default entry,
.RI \(lq default ,\(rq
or must be defined in the
.BR tcapconf (5)
configuration file.
.TP
.I type
Always
.BR sccp .
.TP
.I device
is the device to open to create a SCCP Stream.  For the SCCP the device is normally
\(lq\fB/dev/sccp\fINN\fR,\(lq
where
.I NN
is the number of the SCCP Network Appearance to which the signalling link corresponds.
.TP
.I modules
is the modules to push over the open device Stream necessary to create a signalling link Stream
supporting the Signalling Link Interface (SLI),
.BR sli (7).
This field is a comma-separated list of module names, with no intervening whitespace.  Modules are
pushed in the order in which they appear in the list.  For TCAP, the module list is normally null
and is specified as a single dash,
.RB ` - '.
.TP
.I version
is the protocol version for TCAP.  This field can be one of the following:
.RS
.TP \w'\fBrfc3332\fR\(em'u
.B rfc3331
RFC 3331
.[

.RE
.TP
.I sdli
is the Signalling Data Link Identifier that is used to identify (to external entities) the physical
signalling data link.  This number is a 16-bit integer and many be Circuit Identification Code
(CIC).
.TP
.I sdti
is the Signalling Data Terminal Identifier that is used to identify (to external entities) the
termination of the signalling data link on a signalling terminal.
.TP
.I iid
is the interface identifier use to identify the signalling link to the remote Signalling Gateway.
When the above value,
.IR sdli " and " sdti
are defined, and this field is specified as default by using a single dash,
.RB ` - ',
and the SG supports dynamic configuration, then the
.IR sdli " and " sdti
fields will be used in a link key to register the signalling link with the remote Signalling Gateway
and obtain a dynamically registered Interface Identifier.
When an integer Interface Identifier is used, it should be the same as the global TEI.  When a text
Interface Identifier is used, it should be the same as the AOID.
.TP
.I mode
is the traffic mode type for the signalling link interface.  The traffic mode type can take on
values as follows:
.BR override ", " loadshare " or " broadcast .
.TP
.I sdl-profile
is the signalling data link parameters profile to configure the signalling data link.  The profile
must either be the default entry consisting of a single dash,
.RB ` - ',
or must be defined in the
.BR tcapconf (5)
configuration file.  It is also possible to place the parameter definitions in-line, or
modifications some parameter definitions, enclosed in braces,
.RB ( {} )
following either the profile name, or by themselves.
.TP
.I sdt-profile
is the signalling data terminal parameters profile to configure the signalling data terminal.  The profile
must either be the default entry consisting of a single dash,
.RB ` - ',
or must be defined in the
.BR tcapconf (5)
configuration file.  It is also possible to place the parameter definitions in-line, or
modifications some parameter definitions, enclosed in braces,
.RB ( {} )
following either the profile name, or by themselves.
.PP
When the
.B -f
option is specified,
.B tcapconf
opens the configuration file,
.IR FILENAME ,
and reads the entries line by line.  Each entry is independent of other entries.  For each entry of
.I type
.BR tcap ,
.BR tcapconf
performs the following actions:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The utility opens the device specified in the
.I device
field (typically,
.BR /dev/tcap_as )
using the
.BR open (2s)
system call.  The utility then pushes the modules specified in the
.I modules
field (typically null) using the
.IR I_PUSH (7)
input-output control.
.IP 2.
The utility configures the signalling link using signalling link input-output controls in accordance
with the
.IR profile ", " sdt-profile " and " sdl-profile
values, using
.BR sl_ioctl (4),
.BR sdt_ioctl (4)
and
.BR sdl_ioctl (4)
input-output controls.
(Note that TCAP is incapable of providing the signalling link protocol values at the SG side of the
connection to the ASP side.)
.IP 3.
The utility attaches the signalling link using the concatenation of the Signalling Data Link
Identifier,
.IR sdli ,
and the Signalling Data Terminal Identifier,
.IR sdti ,
as a Physical Point of Attachment,
.IR lmi_ppa ,
in a
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive.
.IP 4.
The utility links the resulting signalling link Stream under the SL-MUx multiplexing driver using
the
.IR I_PLINK (7)
input-output control and closes the file descriptor for the Stream.
.IP 5.
The utility uses the SL-MUX specific input-output controls to assign the
.IR clei ", " global-ppa " and " type
values to the linked signalling link.  Streams opened on the SL-MUX driver can then attach to this
Signalling Link using the global TEI or AOID for the signalling link.
.PP
Once the
.B tcapconf
utility has linked and configured all of the signalling link Streams specified on the command line,
or in the configuration file, it watches the configuration file for changes and effects those
changes when they occur.  Changes are effected by linking additional signalling links or unlinking
existing signalling links to alter the configuration of the SL-MUX to match that of the altered
configuration file.
.\"

.SH SIGNALS
.PP
.TP
.RI { SIGHUP }
This signal causes the
.B tcapconf
utility to reread the configuration file.
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1) indicates that an
error occurred and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message is printed on
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
options suppresses the printing of diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B tcapconf
is an OpenSS7-specific configuration command.  Because this command is used at startup and is
transparent to the SL-User opening SL streams, compatibility is not an issue.

.PP
Configuration is not subject to standardization.
The utility conforms to OpenSS7 project specifications, coding and options standards.
