.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B test-voip
is a test suite executable for the
.BR VOIP (4)
.I STREAMS
modules.
The purpose of the
.B test-voip
test suite executable is to provide a means for development, diagnostic, regression and validation
testing of the
.BR VOIP (4)
modules.
The
.I @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package also provides an
.B autotest
based test suite that uses the
.B test-voip
test case executable to invoke test cases.  This test suite can be used for development, diagnostic,
regression or validation testing.
See the
.I @PACKAGE_TITLE@ Installation and Reference Manual
for more information on how to invoke the
.B autotest
test suite.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B test-voip
options fall into several categories as detailed in the subsections below.  If
.B test-voip
is executed without any options, it will execute all available test cases and report the progress
and results of each test case.
.SS Command Options
.PP
These command options determine whether test cases are run or whether an informative function is
performed instead.  If none of these command options are specified, then it is assumed that all test
cases are to be executed.  Options
.BR --list ", " --help ", " --version " and " --copying
will override the
.BR --onetest " and " --tests
options.
.TP
\fB-o\fR, \fB--onetest\fR [\fITESTCASE\fR]
Specifies a single test case to run.
.I TESTCASE
is the individual test case number.  This option may be repeated and is accumulative: that is, each
test case added with an occurence of this option will be added to the other test cases selected with
.B --onetest
or with
.BR --tests .
.TP
\fB-t\fR, \fB--tests\fR [\fIRANGE\fR]
Specifies a range of test cases to run.
.I RANGE
specifies the range of test cases and will match all test cases that have this string as an initial
substring of the test case number.  If
.I RANGE
is not specified, then all test cases are selected.
.TP
\fB-l\fR, \fB--list\fR [\fIRANGE\fR]
When this option is encountered,
print a list of test cases to
.I stdout
and exit.
When a
.I RANGE
of test cases is specified, only the specified range of tests will be listed.  When a
.I RANGE
is not specified, all test cases will be listed.
When used in combination with
.B --verbose
this option will print more or less information about each test case.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR, \fB-?\fR, \fB--?\fR
When this option is encountered,
print usage information to
.I stdout
and exit.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
When this option is encountered,
print version information to
.I stdout
and exit.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.
.TP
\fB-C\fR, \fB--copying\fR
When this option is encountered,
print copying information to
.I stdout
and exit.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.
.SS General Options
.PP
The following options are applicable to all command options.  For other than test case command
options, these general options must appear ahead of the command option.
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Specifies that the caller is interested only in the return code and error diagnostics and that
normal output should be suppressed.
The default verbosity level if this option is not specified is
.RB ( 1 ).
This option is equivalent to
.BR --verbose=0 .
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR [\fILEVEL\fR]
Increases or sets the verbosity level.  When this option is given without the
.I LEVEL
argument, it specifies that the verbosity level should be increased by one.  If the
.I LEVEL
argument is specified, the verbosity level is set to that integer value.  This option can be
repeated.
The default verbosity level if this option is not specified is
.RB ( 1 ).
For example,
.B -vvvv
is equivalent to
.BR --verbose=5 .
.SS Test Case Options
.PP
The following options are only applicable if a test case command option is in effect.
That is, these options are only effective if test cases are being executed and are used to modify
the manner in which test cases are executed or test case results reported.
.\".TP
.\"\fB-d\fR, \fB--device\fR \fIDEVICE\fR
.\"Specifies the device name to open for the tests.
.TP
\fB-w\fR, \fB--wait\fR
Specifies that the client or server is to wait indefinitely.  Normally a test
case guard timer is started (40 seconds) that will fire and cause the test
case to fail if the test cases waits indefinitely for an event to start or
continue.  This option suppresses the test cause guard timer and allows the 
client or server to wait indefinitely from some event to occur.  This is
particularly useful when one side of the test case (client or server) is being
run manually.
.TP
\fB-e\fR, \fB--exit\fR
Specifies that the first test case run that is not successful will cause all remaining test cases to
be skipped and the return code will reflect the result of the failed test case.
This option is useful in conjunction with option
.B --onetest
in that if a single test is being run, the return code will reflect the result of the test case.
This is used by the
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
test suite to run individual tests under
.BR autotest .
.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fB--again\fR
Specifies that the selected test cases are to be repeated in verbose mode if
they fail in non-verbose mode.  This option is useful for use with autotest
test suites.
.TP
\fB-R\fR, \fB--repeat\fR
Repeat the selected test cases on success or failure.  This option causes the
executable to loop through the selected test cases, one after the other,
regardless of whether an individual test case succeeds or fails.
This option is useful in conjunction with \fB--onetest\fR and \fB--client\fR
or \fB--server\fR when the other end of the test is being executed manually.
.TP
\fB-r\fR, \fB--repeat-fail\fR
Repeat the selected test cases on failure.  This option causes the executable
to loop individual test cases when they fail, but allows the test sequence to
continue when an individual test case succeeds.
This option is useful in conjunction with \fB--onetest\fR and \fB--client\fR
or \fB--server\fR when the other end of the test is being executed manually.
.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--fast\fR [\fISCALE\fR]
When this option is present, test cases are run faster by the integer scaling factor
.IR SCALE .
If
.I SCALE
is not provided, then the default scale factor is
.BR 50 .
This has the effect of scaling timers both in the implementation under test as well as in the test
suite.  If the scale factor,
.IR SCALE ,
is too large, test cases may fail that would otherwise pass.  This option is useful for long test
suite runs that would otherwise take an inordinate amount of time to execute.  Timers can be scaled
for development, diagnostic or regression testing, however, for full validation testing this option
should not be used.
.TP
\fB-s\fR, \fB--summary\fR
Print a test case summary with each test case result at the end of the test suite run.  The default
if this option is not present is to not print a summary.
.TP
\fB-m\fR, \fB--messages\fR
Indicates whether messages, in hexadecimal, should be included in the test case output.  This is
independent of any
.B --verbose
setting.
.SS Client Server Options
.PP
The following options are applicable to all command options.  These options
determine whether the test case executes in client mode, server mode, or both
and the addresses and port numbers associated with the client and server.
.PP
The following two options determine whether the test cases execute in client
mode, server mode or both.  The default (that is used by
.BR autotest )
is to execute both the client and server sides in a self-validation test.
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--client\fR
Requests that the client side of the test cases be executed (client mode).
The default if neither the \fB-c\fR or \fB-S\fR options are specified is to
execute both the client and server side of the selected test cases.
Specifying both \fB-S\fR and \fB-c\fR has the same effect as the default
(specifying neither).
.TP
\fB-S\fR, \fB--server\fR
Requests that the server side of the test cases be executed (server mode).
The default if neither the \fB-c\fR or \fB-S\fR options are specified is to
execute both the client and server side of the selected test cases.
Specifying both \fB-S\fR and \fB-c\fR has the same effect as the default
(specifying neither).
.PP
The following four options determine the IP addresses and port numbers that
are used on the client and server sides of the test.  The defaults (used by
.BR autotest )
are localnet addresses 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2 and 127.0.0.3 and test case
unique port numbers in the range beginning at port number 18000 (to avoid
timed waits and connections that have otherwise not yet been shut down).
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--client-port\fR [\fIPORT\fR]
Specify the client port number, \fIPORT\fR, from which to connect (client
mode) or from which to accept connections (server mode).
This option can be specified in both client and server mode.  In client mode
it identifies the local port; in server mode, the remote port.
The default if a port number is not specified is for the client to connect
from port number \fB18000\fR, offset by the index of the test case time three
(one for connecting, one for listening and one for responding), resulting in a
unique port number for each device file descriptor invoved in each test.  So,
for example, the first test case will connect from port \fB18000\fR, the
second from port \fB18003\fR, and so on.
.TP
\fB-P\fR, \fB--server-port\fR [\fIPORT\fR]
Specify the server port number, \fIPORT\fR, upon which to listen (server mode)
or to which to connect (client mode).
This option can be specified in both client and server mode.  In client mode
it identifies the remote port; in server mode, the local port.
The default if a port number is not specified is for the sever to listen on
port number \fB18002\fR, offset by the index of the test case times three (one
for connecting, one for listening and one for responding), resulting in a
unique port number for each device file descriptor invoked in each test.  So,
for example, the first test case will listen on port \fB18002\fR, the second
on port \fB18005\fR, and so on.
.TP
\fB-i\fR, \fB--client-host\fR [\fIHOSTNAME\fR[\fB,\fIHOSTNAME\fR]*]
Specify the client hostnames, \fIHOSTNAME\fR, from which to connect (client
mode), or from which to accept connections (server mode).
Each \fIHOSTNAME\fR can be either a host name or a numbers-and-dots notation
IP address.  Multiple host names can be specified, separated by commas.
This option can be specified in both client and server mode.  In client mode
it identies the local host; in server mode, the remote host.
The default if a host name is not specified is the IP addresses
\fB127.0.0.1\fR, \fB127.0.0.2\fR and \fB127.0.0.3\fR.
.TP
\fB-I\fR, \fB--server-host\fR [\fIHOSTNAME\fR[\fB,\fIHOSTNAME\fR]*]
Specify the server hostnames, \fIHOSTNAME\fR, upon which to listen (server
mode), or to which to connect (client mode).
Each \fIHOSTNAME\fR can be either a host name or a numbers-and-dots notation
IP address.  Multiple host names can be specified, separated by commas.
This option can be specified in both client and server mode.  In client mode
it identies the remote host; in server mode, the local host.
The default if a host name is not specified is the IP addresses
\fB127.0.0.1\fR, \fB127.0.0.2\fR and \fB127.0.0.3\fR.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
When
.B test-voip
fails, it prints a diagnostic message to
.I stderr
and exits with a non-zero return code.
The following return codes are generated under the following conditions:
.IP 0 4
Execution was successful.
One test case was selected for execution and that test case succeeded or was not applicable (i.e.
unsupported).
This exit code is interpreted by
.B autotest
as a
.I PASS
condition.
.IP 1
One test case was selected for execution and that test case failed or was inconclusive.
More than one test case was selected and abort on failure was specified using the
.B --exit
option, and a test case in the selected test cases failed or was inconclusive.
This exit code is interpreted by
.B autotest
as a
.IR FAIL " or " XFAIL
condition.
.IP 2
An invalid parameter was provided.
Test case execution was specified with options
.BR --onetest " or " --tests ,
or listing of test cases was specified with option
.BR --list ,
but no test case was selected by these options.
More than one test case was selected for execution and a check of the test suite setup failed.
This exit code is interpreted by
.B autotest
as a
.IR FAIL " or " XFAIL
condition.
.IP 77
One test case was selected for execution and that test case was skipped.
This exit code is interpreted by
.B autotest
as a
.I SKIPPED
condition.
