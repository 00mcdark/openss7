.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The ACB56 driver provides a SS7 STREAMS driver which provides a Style 1
SDTI interface (\fBsdti\fR(7)) for the SeaLevel ACB56 card using V.35 at
56kbps.

The driver can be opened using the \fBopen\fR(2) command on the character
special device corresponding to an equipped ACB56 card, or can be opened using
a clone device to obtain a filedescriptor for the next available ACB56 device
in the system.  The device driver is not normally opened by user-level
programs, but is opened by the SS7 Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8).
Nevertheless, it is possible to open the device directly and interact with the
device with \fBsdti\fR(7) primitives using \fBputmsg\fR(2) and \fBgetmsg\fR(2)
and ioctls using \fBioctl\fR(2).

.SS "Configuration"

For all configuration IOCTLs and PRIMITIVEs, ACB56 supports the low-speed link
members of the SDTI configuration \fBsdt_conf\fR structure as follows:

.TP 6
\fIpvar\fR
(Default: SS7_PVAR_ITUT_96)
ACB56 supports all of the protocol variants described in \fBss7\fR(7).  When
\fIpvar\fR is altered alone, other members are adjusted to default values for
the specified protocol variant.

.TP
\fIpopt\fR
(Default: 0)
ACB56 does not support any of the protocol options described in \fBsdti\fR(7).
Because it is a low-speed link, \fBSDT_POPT_EIM\fR is not supported.  ACB56
does not implement IAC in the SDT and, as such, \fBSDT_POPT_IAC\fR is not
supported.

.TP
\fIM\fR
(Default: 0)
This is an IAC (Intial Alignment Control) parameter.  The ACB56 does not
implement intial alignment control, so ignores any values placed in this
configuration member.

.TP
\fITin\fR 
Default: 4)
ACB56 defaults this AERM normal proving threshold to the default values of
ITU-T Recommendation Q.703 1996.

.TP
\fITie\fR
(Default: 1)
ACB56 defaults this AERM emergency proving threshold to the default values of
ITU-T Recommendation Q.703 1996.

.TP
\fIT\fR
(Default: 256)
ACB56 defaults this SUERM threshold to the default values of ITU-T
Recommendation Q.703 1996.

.TP
\fID\fR
(Default: 256)
ACB56 defaults this SUERM downcount to the default values of ITU-T
Recommendation Q.703 1996.

.TP
\fIN\fR
(Default: 16)
ACB56 defaults this DAEDR octet count to the default values of ITU-T
Recommendation Q.703 1996.

.TP
\fIt8\fR, \fITe\fR, \fIDe\fR, \fIUe\fR
(Default: 0)
These EIM (Errorred Interval Monitor) configuration members are only used by
high-speed links.  As a low-speed link only implementation, ACB56 ignores any
values placed in these configuration members.

.SS "Local Management Primitives"

The ACB56 driver will accept the following local management primitives
exchanged with the \fBputmsg\fR(2) and \fBgetmsg\fR(2) system calls:

.TP
.B SDT_INFO_REQ, SDT_INFO_ACK
ACB67 implements the \fBSDT_INFO_REQ\fR and \fRSDT_INFO_ACK\fR local
management primitives as described in \fBsdti\fR(7).  ACB56 will normally
return the following values in the members of the \fBsdt_info_ack\fR
structure:

.RS
.TP 14
\fIsdt_version\fR
ACB56 will always return 0x01000000 indicating that the driver has been
written to the SDTI Version 1.0.0.0 specification.
.TP
\fIsdt_state\fR
ACB56 will return the state of the SDT interface.  Because ACB56 is a Style 1
device driver, it will never return \fBSDT_UNATTACHED\fR and opens in the
\fBSDT_DISABLED\fR state.
.TP
\fIsdt_max_sdu\fR
ACB56 is a low-speed SS7 link not supporting extended sequence numbers (Q.703
Annex A) and will always return 277 (bytes) as the maximum sdu size.
size.
.TP
\fIsdt_min_sdu\fR
ACB56 is a low-speed SS7 link not supporting extended sequence numbers (Q.703
Annex A) and will always return 3 (bytes) as the minimum sdu size.
.TP
\fIsdt_ppa_style\fR
ACB56 is a Style 1 SDTI device driver and will always return \fBSDT_STYLE1\fR
as the PPA style.
.TP
\fIsdt_ppa_addr\fR
ACB56 is a Style 1 SDTI device driver and will always return all zeros in the
PPA address.
.TP
\fIsdt_bitrate\fR
ACB56 only supports 56kbps V.35 operation and will always return 56000 (bps)as
the bitrate.
.TP
\fIsdt_config\fR
See section on "CONFIGURATION".
.RE

.TP
.B SDT_CONFIG_REQ, SDT_CONFIG_ACK, SDT_ERROR_ACK
ACB56 will always return \fBSDT_ERROR_ACK\fR when a configuration request is
made which contains a configuration parameter or option which is not supported
by the driver.  Otherwise, a \fBSDT_CONFIG_ACK\fR is returned which contains
that actual configuration of options and parameters.  For more information on
configuration options and parameters, see section "CONFIGURATION".

.TP
.B SDT_ATTACH_REQ, SDT_OK_ACK, SDT_ERROR_ACK
ACB56 is a Style 1 SDTI device driver and will always return
\fBSDT_ERROR_ACK\fB with \fIsdt_errno\fR set to \fBSDT_OUTSTATE\fR in response
to an attach request.

.TP
.B SDT_DETACH_REQ, SDT_OK_ACK, SDT_ERROR_ACK
ACB56 is a Style 1 SDTI device driver and will always return
\fBSDT_ERROR_ACK\fB with \fIsdt_errno\fR set to \fBSDT_NOTSUPP\fR in response
to a detach request.

.TP
.B SDT_ENABLE_REQ, SDT_ENABLE_CON, SDT_ERROR_ACK
ACB56 supports immediate enabling and will always return an
\fBSDT_ENABLE_CON\fR immediately to a successful \fBSDT_ENABLE_REQ\fR.  The
driver also supports all receiver and transmitter initialization options
described in \fBsdti\fR(7).

.TP
.B SDT_DISABLE_REQ, SDT_DISABLE_CON, SDT_ERROR_ACK
ACB56 suports immediate disabling and will always return an
\fBSDT_DISABLE_CON\fR immediately to a successful \fBSDT_DISABLE_REQ\fR.  The
driver also supports all receive and transmitter disposition options described
in \fBsdti\fR(7).

.SS "Primitive Interface"

ACB56 will accept the following protocol primitives (as described in
\fBsdti\fR(7)) exchanged with \fBputmsg\fR(2), \fBgetmsg\fR(2), and in some
cases \fBwrite\fR(2) and \fBread\fR(2).  ACB56 treats the \fBM_PROTO\fR and
\fBM_PCPROTO\fR forms of each request in a similar manner.  All request
primitives are acted upon immediately when possible, regardless of whether
they are an \fBM_PROTO\fR or \fBM_PCPROTO\fR.  If the device becomes
overdriven and it becomes impossible to act on the primitive immediately,
ACB56 will queue \fBM_PROTO\fR primitives for later execution, but will
discard \fBM_PCPROTO\fR primitives which cannot be acted upon immediately.

.TP
.B "SDT_SIGNAL_UNIT_REQ, SDT_SIGNAL_UNIT_IND, M_DATA"
Although ACB56 will accept the \fBM_PROTO\fR or \fRM_PCPROTO\fR forms of the
request, it will only return the \fBM_DATA\fR form of the indication.  This
means that signal units must be taken from the driver using \fBread\fR(2), and
it is more efficient to write them to the driver using \fBwrite\fR(2).

.TP
.B "SDT_DAEDT_START_REQ"
Starts the ACB56 DAEDT (transmitters).

.TP
.B "SDT_DAEDR_START_REQ"
Starts the ACB56 DAEDR (receivers).

.TP
.B "SDT_DAEDR_CORRECT_SU_IND"
ACB56 only delivers this indication on the first correct SU following a
\fBSDT_AERM_ABORT_PROVING\fR indication to limit the number of such
indications which are provided to the IAC in the upper level.  This primitive
triggers another proving period if further proving is required from the SDT
user.

.TP
.B "SDT_AERM_START_REQ, SDT_AERM_STOP_REQ"
Starts and stops the ACB56 AERM (Alignment Error Rate Monitor).

.TP
.B "SDT_AERM_ABORT_PROVING_IND"
ACB56 gives this indication when the internal AERM state machine detects that
the number of SU errors during the interval that the AERM has been running has
exceeded the configured threshold.

.TP
.B "SDT_SUERM_START_REQ, SDT_SUERM_STOP_REQ"
Starts and stop the ACB56 SUERM (Signal Unit Error Rate Monitor).

.TP
.B "SDT_SUERM_LINK_FAILURE_IND"

.TP
.B "SDT_EIM_START_REQ, SDT_EIM_STOP_REQ"
ACB56 does not support high-speed links and will return \fBSDT_ERROR_IND\fR
with \fIsdt_errno\fR set to \fBSDT_NOTSUPP\fR if these requests are made.

.TP
.B "SDT_EIM_LINK_FAILURE_IND"
ACB56 does not support high-speed links and will never make this indication.

.TP
.B "SDT_LINK_CONG_IND, SDT_NO_LINK_CONG_IND"
ACB56 does not detect congestion in the SDTI driver and will not make these
indications.
