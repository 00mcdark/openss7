.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B mfeproto
is a configuration command intended on being executed from system
configuration scripts, and, in particular, the
.BR snetd (8)
configuration daemon.
Its purpose is to add, interrogate or delete a Frame Relay encapsulated protocol
and its associated tuning parameters.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The
.B mfeproto
command accepts the following options:
.SS Command Options
.PP
The following command options are mutually exclusive (except for \fB-h\fP,
\fB-V\fP and \fB-C\fP which never cause an error when specified with another
command option).  If no command option is given, \fB-G\fP is assumed.
.TP
\fB-G\fP, \fB--get\fP
Retrieve configuration information for the specified \fIprotocol\fP, from the
default or specified \fIdevice\fP, and write the output to \fIstdout\fP (or
\fIfilename\fP, when given).  This option can be used to create a properly
formatted configuration file from an existing system configuration.
The \fB-p\fP option must be specified with this option.
.TP
\fB-A\fP, \fB--add\fP
Load configuration information for the specified \fIprotocol\fP, to the default
or specified \fIdevice\fP, getting the confirmation input from \fIstdin\fP (or
\fIfilename\fP, when given).  This option can be use to alter current system
configuration.  The \fB-p\fP option must be specified with this option.
.TP
\fB-R\fP, \fB--remove\fP
Remove configuration information for the specified \fIprotocol\fP, from the
default or specified \fIdevice\fP, and write the previous configuration as
output to \fIstdout\fP (or \fIfilename\fP, when given).  This option can be use
to alter current system configuration.
The \fB-p\fP option must be specified with this option.
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
When this option is encountered, usage information is printed to \fIstdout\fP,
option processing stops, and the program exists successfully without taking
any further action.
.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
When this option is encountered, version information is printed to
\fIstdout\fP, option processing stops, and the program exists successfully
without taking any further action.
.TP
\fB-C\fP, \fB--copying\fP
When this option is encountered, copying permissions is printed to
\fIstdout\fP, option processing stops, and the program exists successfully
without taking any further action.
.\"
.SS Non-Command Options
.PP
The following non-command options can be combined together and with any
command option.  Non-command options that are not necessary for the specified
command option do not generate an error by mere combination.
.TP
\fB-e\fP, \fB--extended\fP
Normally \fB\)mfeproto\fP processes a fixed number of lines from \fIstdin\fP (or
\fIfilename\fP) when sepcified, and outputs a fixed number of lines to
\fIstdout\fP (or \fIfilename\fP) when specified.  This fixed number of lines are
strictly compatible with other implementations of \fB\)mfeproto\fP.
.RS
.PP
When the \fB-e\fP option is specified, additional lines are accepted on input and are generated on
output.  For the format of the fixed lines and the additional lines, see
.BR mfetemplate (5).
.RE
.TP
\fB-p\fP, \fB--protocol\fP \fIprotocol\fP
Specifies the protocol index (a administrator chosen index) for the protocol
being added, interrogated or deleted.
.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--device\fP \fIdevice\fP
be specified with this option.
Specifies the device to open when tuning.  When unspecified, the device is
\fB/dev/mfe\fP.  See also \*(lq\fIDEVICES\fP,\*(rq below.
.TP
\fB-n\fP, \fB--dryrun\fP
Execute the command (\fB-A\fP, \fB-R\fP or \fB-G\fP) as a dry run.  When this
option is specified with the \fB-A\fP option, the input is read and checked
for validity, but the configuration is not written to the device.  When
specified with the \fB-G\fP option, information is read from the device, but
configuration information is not output.  When specified with the \fB-R\fP
option, the subnet is tested for existence, but not removed.
The exit status and diagnostic
output of the command still reflects the success or failure of the command.
.TP
\fB-q\fP, \fB--quiet\fP
Suppresses normal output.  This is the same as \fB--verbose\fP=\fB0\fP.
.TP
\fB-D\fP, \fB--debug\fP [\fIlevel\fP]
Increase or specify the debug verbosity \fIlevel\fP.  The default debug
\fIlevel\fP is zero (0).  This option may be repeated.  Level zero (0)
corresponds to no debugging output.
.TP
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP [\fIlevel\fP]
Increase or specify the output verbosity \fIlevel\fP.  The default output
\fIlevel\fP is one (1).  This option may be repeated.  Level zero (0)
corresponds to no normal output.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
The following non-option arguments may be provided on the comman line:
.TP
.I filename
Specifies the \fIfilename\fP from which to read (\fB-A\fP option) or write
(\fB-G\fP option) configuraiton information.
.RS
.PP
This argument is optional.  When the \fIfilename\fP is not given and the \fB-A\fP
option is specified, the values are read from \fIstdin\fP; for the \fB-G\fP
option, written to \fIstdout\fP.
.PP
If the \fIfilename\fP is an absolute path (i.e. begins with \*(lq\fB/\fP\*(rq),
then \fIfilename\fP is assumed to be the next path specified.  Otherwise, the
file required is assumed to be
\fB@configdir@/@PACKAGE@/template/\fP\fIfilename\fP.  See
.BR mfetemplate (5)
for the format of the file.
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1)
indicates that an error occured and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option or argument syntax was in error and a
diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
option suppresses the printing of normal output to
.I stdout
and diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .

.\"
.SH FILE FORMAT
.PP
For the file format, see
.BR mfeprotoconf (5).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
On input, this implementation will handle fields that are separated by any
whitespace (any number of blanks, horizontal tabs, new lines, carriage returns,
vertical tabs, form feeds).
.\"
.\"
.SH FILES
.PP
.TP
.BI @configdir@/@PACKAGE@/template/ filename
The default directory location for configuration files used by this command.

.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
A version of this command is provided by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
for compatibility with systems that require it.  Neither this command nor the
.BR snetd (8)
are recommended for configuration of the

subsystems.  Use the SNMP agent instead.

and all long options, are specific to this
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation of
.BR mfeproto
and will not be used by portable command scripts.
.IP \(em
No other implementation documents printing the output to a file when a
.I filename
is specified with the
.B -G
command option.  This is an enhancement of this implementation.
.IP \(em
No other implementation documents the
.BR -e ", " -n ", " -q ", " -v ", " -h ", " -V " and " -C
options.  They will not be used by portable command scripts. 
.IP \(em
Options
.BR --help " and " --version
are provided for compatibility with GNU coding standards (GNITS);
.BR --copying ,
OpenSS7 coding standards.
.IP \(em
.B mfeproto
attempts to be source (and script) compatible with historical implementations
based on
.IR "Spider Frame Relay" ,
however, binary compatibility is not attempted.  Any binary compatability
acheived is likely to be removed in a subsequent release.
.PP
For additional compatibility considerations, see
.BR mfe (4),
.BR mfeprotoconf (5),
and
.BR STREAMS (9).
