.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Activates the transmitting end of a dual-system test.  The basic function of
the utility is to set up a transport endpoint, bind to that endpoint, and
then issue a connect request.  Once a connection is set up,
.B sttxt
will send data TPDUs to the receiving end of the connection (typically
\fBstrxt\fP(8)).
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.SS Command Options
.PP
The following command options are mutually exclusive: only one command option
should be present on the command line at a time.  The exceptions are the
\fB-h\fP, \fB-V\fP and \fB-C\fP options that can be specified alone, or with
any other option.
When
.B sttxt
is used without a command option, the default is Class 4, CLNS: that is, LAN.
.TP
\fB-0\fP
Specifies TP Class 0 and CONS.
.TP
\fB-2\fP
Specifies TP Class 2 and CONS.
.TP
\fB-4\fP
Specifies TP Class 4 and CONS.
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
When this option is encountered, display usage information to
.IR stdout ,
stop options processing, and exit without taking further action.
.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
When this option is encountered, display version information to
.IR stdout ,
stop options processing, and exit without taking further action.
Prints the version number of
.BR sttxt .
Choosing this switch will disable
.B sttxt
from executing.
.TP
\fB-C\fP, \fB--copying\fP
When this option is encountered, display copying information to
.IR stdout ,
stop options processing, and exit without taking further action.
.\"
.SS Common Options
.PP
The following common options can be specified together with a command option.
It is not an error to specify options that are not necessary for the command
option with which they are specified.
.TP
\fB-b\fP, \fB--bytes\fP \fIBYTES\fP
Specifies the number of bytes of data, \fIBYTES\fP, in each transmitted TPDU.  The
.B sttxt
and
.RB strxt (8)
utilities should agree on the number of bytes exchanged in TPDUs.  The
default is 16,256 bytes.
.TP
\fB-c\fP, \fB--connections\fP \fIVALUE\fP
Specifies the maximum number of connections.
.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--data\fP \fISTRING\fP
Enables data integrity checking.  For example, specifying a
.I STRING
of 123456 indicates that the sequence "123456" be used as the data content of
transmitted TPDUs.  If the same value is specified on the
.BR strxt (8)
side of the connection, you can verify that data is transmitted uncorrupted.
The default is to transmit zeroes.
.TP
\fB-n\fP, \fB--nsap\fP \fIADDRESS\fP
Specifies the remote NSAP or DTE address,
.IR ADDRESS .
.TP
\fB-r\fP, \fB--responder\fP \fISELECTOR\fP
Specifes the responder TSAP selector.
.TP
\fB-s\fP, \fB--seconds\fP \fISECONDS\fP
Specifies the number of seconds between statistics reports.
.TP
\fB-v\fP, \fB--vary\fP \fISIZE\fP
Enables varying of the TIDU size.
.TP
\fB-q\fP, \fB--quiet\fP
Suppress normal output.  Only the return code of the command is of interest.
This has the same effect as \fB--verbose=0\fP.
Enables quiet mode.  Only error messages are displayed.
.TP
\fB-x\fP, \fB--debug\fP [\fIlevel\fP]
Specify or increase the debugging verbosity.  Sets the debugging verbosity to
\fIlevel\fP, when given, or simply increases the debuggin verbosity by one
(1) when \fIlevel\fP is not given.  This option can be repeated.
.TP
\fB--verbose\fP [\fIlevel\fP]
Specify or increase the output verbosity.  Sets the output verbosity to
\fIlevel\fP, when given, or simply increases the output verbosity by one when
\fIlevel\fP is not given.  This option can be repeated.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1)
indicates that an error occured and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates the the option or argument syntax was in error and a
diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
option suppresses the printing of normal output to
.I stdout
and diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .

with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Options \fB-q\fP, \fB-v\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-V\fP, \fB-C\fP, and all long
options, are specific to this
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation of
.B sttxt
and should not be used by portable command scripts.
.IP \(em
No other implementation documents the \fB-q\fP, \fB-v\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-V\fP
and \fB-C\fP options.  They should not be used by portable command scripts.
.IP \(em
Options \fB--help\fP and \fB--version\fP are provided for compatibility with
GNU coding standards; \fB--copying\fP, OpenSS7 coding standards.
