.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B x400pconf
is a configuration utility for the X400P-SS7 driver,
.BR x400p-ss7 (4),
and the SL-MUX multiplexing driver,
.BR sl-mux (4).
Its purpose is to open Signalling Link streams on the X400P-SS7 driver, attach them to specific
PPAs, configure the link, and link the SL streams under the SL-MUX multiplexing driver, configure
the lower SL stream, and then wait in the background watching for updates for the configuration file
and apply updates as they occur.
.PP
The
.B x400pconf
is intended to be run at system startup from a System V initialization script.  Once the
configuration of the X400P-SS7 and SL-MUX drivers is complete, applications programs can open,
attach, enable and use Signalling Link streams opened on the driver.
.PP
The purpose of the SL-MUX driver is to provide a unified interface for accessing signalling links of
a number of forms and from a number of various drivers.  Signalling links could correspond to device
drivers, or could be M2UA signalling links or other implementations.  Each type of signalling link
requires some additional configuration before they can be used and will be linked under the SL-MUX
by a separate configuration utility.  The
.B x400pconf
utility is the utility used for the X400P-SS7 driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The
.B x400pconf
utility accepts the following command-line options:
.SS "Command Options"
.PP
On of the following mutually exclusive command options must be specified.  If no command options are
specified,
.B x400pconf
will act as though the
.B -g
option was specified and print the configuration for all X400P-SS7 PPAs.
.TP
[{\fB-g\fR|\fB--get\fR} [\fICLEI\fR|\fIPPA\fR] \fI...\fR]
Get and display the configuration information associated with a specific set of CLEI or PPA, or get
and display information for all PPAs (if no arguments are specified).  The information is displayed
in the same format as contained in the
.BR slconf (5)
configuration file.  This option can be used to obtain information about specific X400P-SS7
signalling links, as well as providing the ability to regenerate the
.B x400p
entries in the
.BR slconf (5)
configuration file.
.RS
.PP

information.
.TP
.I PPA

.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file format is as described in
.BR slconf (5),
with the additional fields defined for devices of type
.BR x400p .
Signalling link specification line entries in the file consist of the following fields:
.PP
.B sl
.RI < clei >
.RI < global-ppa >
.RI < profile >
.RI < device-type >
.RI < device >
.RI < modules >
.RI < card >
.RI < span >
.RI < slot >
.RI < sdt-profile >
.RI < sdl-profile >
.PP
Where,
.TP
.B sl
is the selector indicating that this is a signalling link definition entry.
.TP
.I clei
is a Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) to be associated with this signalling link.
The is the CLEI that can be used by users opening the SL-MUX driver to attach to this signalling
link.
.TP
.I global-ppa
is a global Physical Point of Appearance (PPA) to be associated with this signalling link.
The is the PPA that can be used by users opening the SL-MUX driver to attach to this signalling
link.
.TP
.I profile
is a signalling link protocol parameters profile used to configure this signalling link.  The
profile must either be the default entry,
.BR default ,
or must be defined in the
.BR slconf (5)
configuration file.
It is also possible to place the parameter definitions in-line, enclosed in braces
.RB ( {} ).
.TP
.I device-type
Always
.BR x400p .
.TP
.I device
is the device to open to create a signalling link Stream.
For the X400P-SS7 driver, the device is normally
.RB \(lq /dev/x400p-ss7 \(rq.
At a later date this might be the
.RB \(lq /dev/x400p-ch \(rq
device.
.TP
.I modules
is the modules to push over the open device Stream necessary to create a signalling link Stream
supporting the Signalling Link Interface (SLI),
.BR sli (7).
This field is a comma-separated list of module names, with no intervening whitespace.  Modules are
pushed in the order in which they appear in the list.
For the X400P-SS7 driver, the module is normally null as indicated by a single dash,
.RB ` - '.
At a later point this might be the
.RB \(lq daed \(rq
and
.RB \(lq sl \(rq
modules.
.TP
.I card
is the logical card number of the X400P-SS7 card to which the signalling link belongs.  Logical card
numbers start at zero
.RB ( 0 )
and span through
.IR (n-1) ,
where
.I n
is the number of physical cards present in the system.
.TP
.I span
is the logical span number on the X400P-SS7 card.  Logical spans numbers start at one
.RB ( 1 )
and span through the number of spans supported by the card (i.e. four).
.TP
.I slot
is the logical time slot number on the X400P-SS7 card.  Logical time slot zero
.RB ( 0 )
refers to the entire span.  Logical time slots one
through twenty-four
.RB ( 1 - 24 )
refer to individual time slots in a T1 or J1 span.  Logical time slots one
through thirty-one
.RB ( 1 - 31 )
refer to individual time slots in an E1 span.
.TP
.I sdt-profile
is signalling data terminal parameters profile used to configure the signalling data terminal.  The
profile must either be the default entry,
.BR default ,
or must be defined in the
.BR slconf (5)
configuration file.
It is also possible to place the parameter definitions in-line, enclosed in braces
.RB ( {} ).
.TP
.I sdl-profile
is signalling data link parameters profile used to configure the signalling data link.  The
profile must either be the default entry,
.BR default ,
or must be defined in the
.BR slconf (5)
configuration file.
It is also possible to place the parameter definitions in-line, enclosed in braces
.RB ( {} ).
.PP
When the
.B -f
option is specified,
.B x400pconf
opens the configuration file,
.IR FILENAME ,
and reads the entries line by line.  Each entry is independent of other entries.  For each entry of
.I device-type
.BR x400p ,
.BR x400pconf
performs the following actions:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The utility opens the device specified in the
.I device
field (typically,
.BR /dev/x400p-sl )
using the
.BR open (2s)
system call.
The utility then pushes the modules specified in the
.I modules
field (typically
null)
using the
.IR I_PUSH (7)
input-output control.
.IP 2.
The utility configures the signalling link using signalling link input-output controls in accordance
with the
.IR profile ", " sdt-profile " and " sdl-profile
values, using
.BR sli_ioctl (4),
.BR sdti_ioctl (4)
and
.BR sdli_ioctl (4)
intput-output controls.
.IP 2.
If the
.I local-ppa
field is other than a single dash, the utility interprets the field as an integer number and uses
the integer number in an
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
request to attach the opened Stream to the specific signalling link.
.IP 3.
The utility configures the signalling link using signalling link input-output controls described in
.BR sli_ioctl (4),
to configure the signalling link.
.IP 4.
The utility links the resulting signalling link Stream under the SL-MUX multiplexing driver using
the
.IR I_PLINK (7)
input-output control and closes the file descriptor for the Stream.
.IP 5.
The utility uses SL-MUX specific input-output controls to assign the
.IR clei ", " global-ppa " and " device-type
values to the linked signalling link.  Streams opened on the SL-MUX driver can then attach to this
signalling link using the global PPA or the CLEI for the signalling link.
.PP
Once the
.B x400pconf
utility has linked and configured all of the signalling link Streams specified on the command line,
or in the configuration file, it watches the configuration file for changes and effects those
changes when they occur.  Changes are effected by linking additional signalling links or unlinking
existing signalling links to alter the configuration of the SL-MUX to match that of the altered
configuration file.
.\"
.\"
.SH SIGNALS
.PP
.TP
.RI { SIGHUP }
This signal causes the
.B x400pconf
utility to reread the configuration file.
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1) indicates that an
error occured and a diagnostic messages is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message is printed on
.IR stderr .
.PP
If
.I stderr
has already been redirected to a log file, the diagnostic message will appear in the log file.
.PP
The
.B --quiet
option suppresses printing of diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .
