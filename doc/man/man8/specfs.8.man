.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B specfs
System V Init Script starts, stop, restarts and displays the status of the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
The
.I command
argument can be one of the following:
.TP
(none)
When executed without arguments, the
.B specfs
init script will display a short usage summary and exit.
.TP
.B start
Start the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.
The filesystem is mounted if
.B SPECFS_MOUNT
is set to
.IR yes .
All
.I STREAMS Special Shadow Filesystem
kernel modules in the base package are loaded with
.BR "modprobe" ,
and a lock file is created to indicate that the filesystem has been started.
.TP
.B stop
Stop the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.
The filesystem is unmount if
.B SPECFS_MOUNT
is set to
.IR yes .
Any
.I STREAMS Special Shadow Filesystem
kernel modules that are loaded (that is the
.BR specfs (5)
kernel module), will be removed with
.BR "modprobe -r" .
If devices do not exist and there are no
.I STREAM Special Shadow Filesystem
kernel modules loaded,
.B stop
performs effectively no action.
.TP
.B force-reload
Perform a forced reload of configuration information for the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.
This has the same effect as a
.B reload
except that the lock file is forcibly removed.
.PP
The Debian-style
.B specfs.sh
script also recognizes the following commands:
.TP
.B show
Report on the status of the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.
.PP
The RedHat-style
.B specfs
script also recognizes the following commands:
.TP
.B status
Report on the status of the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.
.TP
.B restart
Restart the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.
.TP
.B try-restart
Try to restart the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.
This has the same effect as a
.B reload
except that the lock file is forcibly removed.
.TP
.B condrestart
Perform a conditional restart of
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.
This is the same as a start if the filesystem is not already running.
This also has the same effect as a
.B reload
except that the lock file is forcibly removed.
.TP
.B reload
Perform a reload of configuration information for the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.  This has the same effect as a
.BR restart .
.TP
.B probe
Probe the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem.  Probing consists of determining the status of the lock file and
configuration files and performing the actions necessary to move the
.IR STREAMS (9)
filesystem to an operational state.  This could be effectively the same as a
.BR start ", " reload " or " restart
depending on the current status of the lock files, configuration files, and
filesystem.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Normally the
.B specfs
or
.B specfs
init script is invoked by the
.BR init (8)
process.
Nevertheless, the script can be invoked by the adminstrator in the usual ways:
.\"
.SS RedHat-Style Systems
.PP
When the init script is installed, it is made known to the
.BR service (8)
command.  The
.BR service (8)
command can be used to invoke the script by name with the same command
arguments as the script itself, at the shell command prompt, as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> service specfs [command]
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.SS SuSE Systems
.PP
When the init script is installed,
.BR inserv (8)
will also create the rc script named
.B rcspecfs
in the
.B /usr/sbin
directory.  This script can be invoked by the adminstrator with the same
command arguments as the
.B specfs
script itself, at the shell command prompt, as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> rcspecfs [command]
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.SS Debian-Style Systems
.PP
When the init script is installed, it is made available in the
.B /etc/init.d
directory and can be invoked directly with the same command arguments, at the
shell command prompt, as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> /etc/init.d/specfs.sh [command]
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.SS Other Systems
.PP
On other System V Init Script compatible systems, the init script is installed
in the
.B /etc/init.d
directory and can be invoked directly, with the same command arguments, at the
shell command prompt, as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> /etc/init.d/specfs [command]
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
The following shell variables can be overridden in a configuration file or via
the environment:
.TP
.B SPECFS_MOUNTPOINT
When set to a directory path, the init script will mount the
.BR specfs (5)
filesystem on the specified mount point.  If the mount point does not exist,
but can be created as a directory, the mount point will be created before
mounting the filesystem.
.IP ""
When not set, the
.BR specfs (5)
filesystem will not be mounted.
.TP
.B SPECFS_UID
Specifies the user id to use for mounting the
.BR specfs (5)
filesystem.  If not specified, the user id will default to the user id of the
process running the script and performing the
.BR mount (8).
.TP
.B SPECFS_GID
Specifies the group id to use for mounting the
.BR specfs (5)
filesystem.  If not specified, the group id will default to the group id of
the process running the script and performing the
.BR mount (8).
.TP
.B SPECFS_MODE
Specifies the mode of the mounted
.BR specfs (5)
filesystem.  If not specified, the mode will default to the umask of the
process running the script and performing the
.BR mount (8).
.TP
.B SPECFS_OPTIONS
Specifies additional options to the mount.  See
.BR mount (8)
and
.BR specfs (5)
for more information.
.PP
The Debian-style
.B streams.sh
script also recognizes the following additional evironment variables:
.TP
.B VERBOSE
When set to other than zero (0), diagnostic messages printed by commands executed
by the script will be printed to standard output.
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
The
.B specfs
and
.B specfs.sh
scripts display success or failure on standard output in the normal manner of
System V Init Scripts for the distribution upon which they are loaded.
Diagnostic messages associated with the failure of the script or any command
in the script are printed on standard error (however, standard error may be
redirected by the invoking script).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To probe the filesystem and move the
.I STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem smoothly to an operational state, execute the following (as root) at
the shell command prompt:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> service specfs probe
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH DEVICES
.PP
When mounted, typically on the
.B /dev/streams
mount point, device nodes corresponding to
.IR STREAMS (9)
drivers will appear in the Special Shadow Filesystem beneath the
.B /dev/streams
directory.
.\"
.\"
.SH FILES
.PP
.TP
.B /etc/rc.d/init.d/specfs
Installed location of the init script on RedHat-style systems.
.TP
.B /etc/init.d/specfs.sh
Installed location of the init script on Debian-style systems and accessible
location of the init script on all systems.
.TP
.B /etc/sysconfig/specfs
The configuration file for the
.B specfs
startup script is located in the
.B /etc/sysconfig/specfs
file (for RedHat-style System V Init Script configurations).
.TP
.B /etc/default/specfs
The configuration file for the
.B specfs.sh
startup script is located in the
.B /etc/default/specfs
file (for Debian-style System V Init Script configurations).
.TP
.B /etc/sysctl.conf
Contains general system wide system controls.
This file has the format described in
.BR sysctl.conf (5).
.I STREAMS
Special Shadow Filesystem system controls can either be placed in this global file or in the
specific file below.
.TP
.B /etc/specfs.conf
Contains
.I STREAMS
Special Shadow Filesystem specific system controls.
This file has the format described in
.BR sysctl.conf (5).
.I STREAMS
Special Shadow Filesystem system controls can either be placed in this specific file or in the
global file above.
.TP
.B /var/lock/subsys/specfs
The subsystem lock file for the
.I STREAMS
subsystem on RedHat-style systems.  This file normally exists when the
Special Shadow Filesystem is initialized and locked.

have no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B specfs
and
.B specfs.sh
init scripts are compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Although the file layout is similar,
.B Linux
init scripts are not necessarily compatible with
.I "SVR 4.2"
.[
svr42
.]
init scripts.
.IP \(em
On
.I SVR 4.2
the
.IR STREAMS (9)
Special Shadow Filesystem is an integral part of the kernel and does not need to be installed or
mounted.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
Initializing the
.I STREAMS
Special Shadow Filesystem is implementation specific and not subject to standardization.
.PP
The
.B specfs
init script conforms to
.I LSB
specification for init scripts and is compatible with a wide range of
RedHat-style and LSB compatibile systems.
.PP
The
.B specfs.sh
init script conforms to
.I Debian
policy.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The
.B specfs
and
.B specfs.sh
init scripts are new to
