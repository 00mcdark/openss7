.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ldltest
is used to test the
.BR ldl (4)
.I STREAMS
driver by using one of the existing standard Linux network drivers to send a
"ping" to another host on the network.  The command line parameters specify
the local-IP and remote-IP addresses and the name of the Driver to use when
sending the ping.
.PP
.B ldltest
is also used to obtain statistics from the
.BR ldl (4)
STREAMS driver and to set debugging masks.

.SH USAGE
.PP
In test mode,
.B ldltest
constructs a ping packet from the parameters given and sends it to the remote
host.  It awaits the response and prints out the round trip time when it
receives the response.  If the -c option is used it sends the ping repeatedly
and prints out the round-trip time every 1,000 packets.
.PP
With the \fB-s\fR, \fB--ping\fR option,
.B ldltest
listens for received frames from the indicated interface driver.  If the
framing is specified as
.B RAW
then it will receive LLC frames from the driver.  Other types of framing
result in non-LLC Ethernet types of frames such as IP packets and ARP
messages.  Thus, the setting of the
.BR -f ", " --framing
option conditions the type of messages that can be received from the
interface.  When an ICMP ping is received, it is responded to.  When an LLC
TEST or XID command is received it is responded to with the corresponding
response frame.
.PP
With the
.BR -g ", " --global
option,
.B ldltest
obtains statistics maintained by the
.BR ldl (4)
driver and prints them out.  This is useful for troubleshooting protocol stack
configuration since you can see whether packets entering
.BR ldl (4)
from either above or below was forwarded to the neighboring module.
.PP
By setting debug bits via the
.BR -d ", " --debug
option, you can cause the
.BR ldl (4)
driver to print the contents of packets flowing into it and out of it.
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1)
indicates that an error occured and a diagnostic message is printed on
.BR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message
is printed to
.BR stderr .
.PP
Errors can result from inadequate permissions, failure of a command on the
underlying
.BR ldl (4)
driver, other failure of the
.BR ldltest
command.
