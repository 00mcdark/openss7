.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B streams
System V Init Script starts, stop, restarts and displays the status of the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
The
.I command
argument can be one of the following:
.TP
(none)
When executed without arguments, the
.B streams
init script will display a short usage summary and exit.
.TP
.B start
Start the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.
Device are installed if
.B STREAMS_MAKEDEVICES
is set to
.IR yes .
All
.I STREAMS
kernel modules in the base package are loaded with
.BR "modprobe" ,
and a lock file is created to indicate that the subsystem has been started.
.TP
.B stop
Stop the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.
Devices are removed if
.B STREAMS_REMOVEDEVICES
is set to
.IR yes .
Any
.I STREAMS
kernel modules that are loaded (with the notable exception of the
.BR specfs (5)
kernel module), will be removed with
.BR "modprobe -r" .
If devices do not exist and there are no
.I STREAMS
kernel modules loaded,
.B stop
performs effectively no action.
.TP
.B force-reload
Perform a forced reload of configuration information for the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.
This has the same effect as a
.B reload
except that the lock file is forcibly removed.
.PP
The Debian-style
.B streams.sh
script also recognizes the following commands:
.TP
.B show
Report on the status of the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.
.PP
The RedHat-style
.B streams
script also recognizes the following commands:
.TP
.B status
Report on the status of the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.
.TP
.B restart
Restart the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.
.TP
.B try-restart
Try to restart the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.
This has the same effect as a
.B reload
except that the lock file is forcibly removed.
.TP
.B condrestart
Perform a conditional restart of
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.
This is the same as a start if the subsystem is not already running.
This also has the same effect as a
.B reload
except that the lock file is forcibly removed.
.TP
.B reload
Perform a reload of configuration information for the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.  This has the same effect as a
.BR restart .
.TP
.B probe
Probe the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem.  Probing consists of determining the status of lock file and
configuration files and performing the actions necessary to move the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem to an operational state.  This could be effectively the same as a
.BR start ", " reload " or " restart
depending on the current status of the lock files, configuration files, and
subsystem.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Normally the
.B streams
or
.B streams.sh
init script is invoked by the
.BR init (8)
process.
Nevertheless, the script can be invoked by the adminstrator in the usual ways:
.\"
.SS RedHat-Style Systems
.PP
When the init script is installed, it is made known to the
.BR service (8)
command.  The
.BR service (8)
command can be used to invoke the script by name with the same command
arguments as the script itself, at the shell command prompt, as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> service streams [command]
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.SS SuSE Systems
.PP
When the init script is installed,
.BR inserv (8)
will also create the rc script named
.B rcstreams
in the
.B /usr/sbin
directory.  This script can be invoked by the adminstrator with the same
command arguments as the
.B streams
script itself, at the shell command prompt, as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> rcstreams [command]
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.SS Debian-Style Systems
.PP
When the init script is installed, it is made available in the
.B /etc/init.d
directory and can be invoked directly with the same command arguments, at the
shell command prompt, as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> /etc/init.d/streams.sh [command]
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.SS Other Systems
.PP
On other System V Init Script compatible systems, the init script is installed
in the
.B /etc/init.d
directory and can be invoked directly, with the same command arguments, at the
shell command prompt, as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> /etc/init.d/streams [command]
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
The following shell variables can be overridden in a configuration file or via
the environment:
.TP
.B STREAMS_MKNOD
The name of the command to execute to create devices for the
.I STREAMS
subystem.  This can be overridden by the configuration file, but will have a
default value that results from searching the following locations for an
executable named
.BR streams_mknod :
.IR ./ : /sbin : /usr/sbin : /bin : /usr/bin .
See
.BR streams_mknod (8).
.TP
.B STREAMS_MODULES
Provides a list of
.I STREAMS
subsystem kernel modules to be loaded when the script starts the subsystem.
This defaults to kernel module
.RB \(lq streams \(rq.
.TP
.B STREAMS_MAKEDEVICES
When equal to
.RI \(lq yes \(rq,
it indicates to the startup script that it is to create device nodes for
.I STREAMS
devices when starting up.  When set to another value, device nodes will not be created.
.TP
.B STREAMS_REMOVEDEVICES
When equal to
.RI \(lq yes \(rq,
it indicates to the startup script that it is to remove device nodes for
.I STREAMS
devices when shutting down.  When set to another value, device nodes will not be removed.
.PP
The Debian-style
.B streams.sh
script also recognizes the following additional evironment variables:
.TP
.B VERBOSE
When set to other than zero (0), diagnostic messages printed by commands executed
by the script will be printed to standard output.
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
The
.B streams
and
.B streams.sh
scripts display success or failure on standard output in the normal manner of
System V Init Scripts for the distribution upon which they are loaded.
Diagnostic messages associated with the failure of the script or any command
in the script are printed on standard error (however, standard error may be
redirected by the invoking script).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To probe the subsystem and move the
.I STREAMS (9)
subsystem smoothly to an operational state, execute the following (as root) at
the shell command prompt:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> service streams probe
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH DEVICES
.PP
The init script typically creates the following character device nodes in the
.B /dev
directory:
.PP
.TS
tab(:);
lnnnl1lrb0l.
