.\"

.SH ARGUMENTS

A pointer to an array of two file descriptors into which to return the file
descriptor for each end of the pipe.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR pipe ()
and
.BR s_pipe ()
opens a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe.
All the way through the
.B Linux
kernel series including 2.6, the
.BR pipe ()
system call provided by glibc will return a
.RB non- STREAMS -based
pipe.
.RB Non- STREAMS -based
pipes are
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
style unidirectional pipes that are not implemented using
.IR STREAMS .
Many commercial
.IR UNIX \(rg
offerings also do not necessarily directly provide
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes in response to the
.BR pipe ()
system call.
.PP
The
.BR libstreams (3)
library provides a
.BR pipe ()
and
.BR s_pipe ()
library call that always provide
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes in contrast to glibc that always provides
.IR "SVR 3" -style
.[
svr3
.]
pipes.
.PP
The characteristics of bi-directional
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes, by comparison to
.IR "SVR 3" -style
.[
svr3
.]
pipes are as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes are bi-directional.  Both sides are opened for both read and write.
Data written to one end of the pipe can be read by the other.  Both ends of
the pipe can have data written and read.
.IP \(bu
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes can have modules pushed and popped from either side of the pipe.
However, before pushing a
.I STREAMS
module on either side of the
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe, the
.BR pipemod (4)
module should be pushed on one end of the
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe to reverse the sens of the
.BR M_FLUSH (9)
bits for proper flushing of the pipe.  (Pushing
.BR pipemod (4)
is not necessary if no other modules are to be pushed over either end of the
pipe.)
.IP \(bu
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes can have the
.BR connld (4)
module pushed onto one end of the pipe.
.IP \(bu
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes can be attached to an object in a filesystem using
.BR fattach (2).
.IP \(bu
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes have controllable flow control and minimum and maximum packet size
characteristics.
.IP \(bu
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes permit the use of
.BR getmsg "(2s), " getpmsg "(2s), " putmsg "(2s) and " putpmsg (2s)
system calls on the pipe ends.  This permits control information as well as
data to be passed across the pipe.
.IP \(bu
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes can pass file descriptors and credentials from one end to the other using
.BR I_SENDFD (7)
and
.BR I_RECVFD (7).
.IP \(bu
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes permit the use of
.BR streamio (7)
.I STREAMS
input-output controls on either pipe end.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes should be used in the following situations:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Bi-directional data transfer is desired.
.IP \(bu
Additional capabilities, such as the ability to preserve record boundardies
across the pipe, transfer zero-length messages, pass ancilliary control
information, or pass file descriptors, are desired.
.IP \(bu
The ability to link a pipe end beneath a multiplexing driver,
.BR I_LINK (7),
or attaching one end to a path in the file system,
.BR fattach (2),
is desired.
.IP \(bu
Servers based on pipes using
.BR connld (4)
and
.BR fattach (2)
is to be supported.
.IP \(bu
Other
.I STREAMS
facilities are desired in association with a pipe end.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR pipe ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
on failure, it returns
minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When it fails,
.BR pipe ()
returns minus one
.RB ( -1 ),
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBENOMEM\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EMFILE ]
More than
.RB { OPEN_MAX }
minus two file descriptors are already in use by the calling process.
.TP
.RB [ ENFILE ]
The system-wide maximum number of simultaneous open file descriptors would be
exceeded.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
Memory could not be allocated for kernel datastructures required to represent
the pipe.
.TP
.RB [ ENODEV ]
The
.BR specfs (5)
file system is not available on the system.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
A suitable pipe device is not available on the system.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe have been shown to match or even outperform
.B Linux
.IR "SVR 3" -style
pipes, therefore, no performance loss is realized by using a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe over a
.B Linux
native pipe.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
There are several ways of implementing
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides two or three approaches.  See
.BR pipe (4)
for additional information.

have no known bugs.

Validated behaviour is provided by the

test case executable and the

.B autotest
test suite.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR pipe "() and " s_pipe ()
are compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
permits each end of a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe to be linked under a multiplexing driver using the
.BR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
.I STREAMS
input-output controls described in
.BR streamio (7).
This is a
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
specific feature provided for special test scenarios: many other
implementations will not permit any pipe end or FIFO to be linked under a
multiplexing driver.
.IP ""
Portable applications will not attempt to link a pipe end under a multiplexing
driver.
.IP \(em
It is normally possible to determine whether a pipe obtained from the
.BR pipe ()
call is a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe or a
.IR "SVR 3" -style
pipe by testing the file flags with
.BR fcntl (2).
If the file flags indicate that both end are open for read and write, then the
pipe is bi-directional and is a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe.  If the file flags indicates the one end is open for read and the other
for write, then the pipe is uni-directional and is a
.IR "SVR 3" -style
pipe.
.IP ""
Portable applications will not assume that a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe has been returned from the
.BR pipe ()
call.  A portable application may assume that
.BR s_pipe (),
or one of the other methods described in
.BR pipe (4),
returns a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe.
