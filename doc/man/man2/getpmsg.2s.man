.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR getpmsg ()
reads a
.I STREAMS
message from the read queue of a stream head into the caller
supplied buffers.  The read messages will contain a control part or a data
part or both.  The data and control parts of the message are handled
separately by
.PP
The meaning and interpretation of the contents of the control part and data
part are specific to the
.I STREAMS
module to which the stream head is attached.
The semantics of these contents forms a necessary part of the
.I STREAMS
module
documentation.
.PP
.BR getpmsg ()
provides finer control over the messages retrieved than does
.BR getmsg (2).
.PP
.I fd
specifies a file descriptor referencing an open stream.
.PP
.I ctlptr
is used to hold the control part of the retrieved message and
.I datptr
is used to hold the data part of the retrieved message.
.IR ctlptr " and " dataptr
each contain
.B NULL
or a pointer to a
.B strbuf
structure, which contains the following members:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct strbuf {
    int maxlen;         /* maximum buffer length */
    int len;            /* length of data */
    char *buf;          /* ptr to buffer */
};
\s+1\fR
.fi
.TP
.I maxlen
specifies the maximum number of bytes that the buffer pointed to by
.I buf
can hold.
When 0 is specified,
.I maxlen
requests that only zero-length message be retrieved.
When -1 is specified,
.I maxlen
requests that the corresponding control or data part not be retrieved.
When set to a positive value,
.I maxlen
requests that at maximum only
.I maxlen
bytes of the control or data part be retrieved.
.TP
.I len
is a return value only.  See
.BR "\*(lqRETURN VALUES\*(rq" ,
below.
.TP
.I buf
points to the buffer into which the data or control information is to be placed.
.PP
If
.IR ctlptr " or " datptr
is
.BR NULL ,
or the corresponding
.I maxlen
field is set to -1, the control or data part of the message is not
processed and is left on the stream head read queue.
.PP
.I bandp
is the lowest numerical priority band of interest.  When
.I flagsp
is set to other than
.BR MSG_BAND ,
the integer pointed to by this argument must be coded zero (0); when
.I flagsp
is set to
.BR MSG_BAND ,
the integer pointed to by this argument indicates the lowest priority band of
interest.
.PP
.I flagsp
When
.I flagsp
points to an integer containing the flag
.BR MSG_ANY " or " MSG_HIPRI ,
.I bandp
should point to an integer containing the priority band 0.
When
.I flagsp
points to an integer containing the flag
.BR MSG_BAND ,
.I bandp
should point to an integer containing the lowest numerical priority band of
interest.
.I flagsp
should point to an integer that indicates the type of message
the user is able to receive and will return the type of message received.
.I flagsp
points to an integer that
can have one of the following values:
.TP
.BR MSG_HIPRI,
requests the retrieval of the first available high priority message
on the stream head read queue, and that low priority messages not be
processed.  For this option, the priority band indicated by
.I bandp
must be 0.
.TP
.BR MSG_ANY,
requests the retrieval of the first available message on the stream
head read queue, regardless of priority.  For this option, the priority band
indicated by
.I bandp
must be 0.
.TP
.BR MSG_BAND,
requests the retrieval of the first available message in a priority
band greater than or equal to the priority band specified in
.IR bandp .
.\"
.\"
.PP
If the stream head is set for non-blocking operation and no message of the
specified type and priority band is available to be read,
.BR getpmsg ()
will fail and set
.I errno
to
.BR EAGAIN " or " EWOULDBLOCK .
If the stream head is set for blocking operation,
.BR getpmsg ()
will block until a message of the specified type and priority band becomes
available on the stream head read queue, or the call is interrupted by a
signal.
If the call is interrupted by a signal in this fashion,
.BR getpmsg ()
will fail and set
.I errno
to
.BR EINTR .
.\"
.PP
If a hangup occurs on the stream from which messages are to be retrieved,
.BR getpmsg ()
continues to operate normally, as described above, until the
stream head read queue is empty.  Thereafter, it returns 0 in the
.I len
field of
.IR ctlptr " and " dataptr .
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR getpmsg ()
will
return -1 and set
.I errno
as described under
.BR \*(lqERRORS\*(rq ,
below.
.PP
Upon success,
.BR getpmsg ()
will return a non-negative value with any of the following flags set:
.TP
.B MORECTL
indicates that more control information belonging to the same message is
waiting to be retrieved from the stream head read queue with a subsequent
.BR getpmsg ()
operation.
.TP
.B MOREDATA
indicates that more data belonging to the same message is waiting to be
retrieved from the stream head read queue with a subsequent
.BR getpmsg ()
operation.
.B 0
indicates that the entire message was received successfully.
.PP
.BR getpmsg ()
with the appropriate arguments will retrieve a higher priority message before
the remainder of a partially retrieved lower priority message is retrieved.
.PP
Upon success,
.BR getpmsg ()
will also alter the
.I len
values in the
.B strbuf
structures pointed to by
.IR ctlbuf " and " datbuf
and the integer values pointed to by
.IR bandp " and " flagp ,
as follows:
The
.I maxlen
member is not altered on return.
If the
.IR ctlptr " or " datptr
a not
.BR NULL ,
and
.I maxlen
is not -1,
the existence and length of the retrieved message is returned in the
.I len
member.
If there is no control or data part retrieved, the
.I len
member of the corresponding
.B strbuf
structure is set to -1.
.PP
If the control or data part retrieved is of zero-length, the control or data
part is removed from the stream head read queue and the returned
.I len
is set to 0.
If
.I maxlen
is greater than or equal to 0 and the number of bytes in the control or
data part is greater than
.IR maxlen ,
only
.I maxlen
bytes are retrieved and the remaining bytes of the corresponding part are left
on the stream head read queue.  In the return value the corresponding more
flag
.BR "" ( MORECTL " or " MOREDATA )
is set.
The
.I buf
member is not altered on return.
.PP
When the integer that
.I flagp
points to returns the flag
.BR MSG_BAND ,
the integer
.I bandp
points to returns the priority band of the retrieved message.
.PP
For
.BR getpmsg ()
the integer pointed to by
.I flagsp
will contain one of the following values:
.TP
.BR MSG_HIPRI,
the retrieved message is a high priority message;
.TP
.BR MSG_BAND,
the retrieved message is not a high priority message--the value in the
integer pointed to by
.I bandp
indicates the priority band of the retrieved message.

.SH ERRORS
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR getpmsg ()
will
return -1 and set
.I errno
as follows:
.TP

.\".TP

.\"
.\"
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I fd
is linked under a multiplexing driver; or,
.BR getpmsg ()
is not supported; or, the flags were invalid for
.BR getpmsg ()
(not
.BR MSG_HIPRI ", " MSG_ANY " or " MSG_BAND ).
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN "], [" EWOULDBLOCK ]
The stream head is set for non-blocking operation and
.BR getpmsg ()
would block: that is, no message of the requested type and priority band is
available to be read.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
A signal was caught, or an
.BR M_SIG (9)
message processed, before the call to
.BR getpmsg ()
could return any data.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSTR ]
.I fd
has no stream associated with the file descriptor.
.TP
.RB [ EBADMSG ]
The message at the head of the queue is of an invalid message type (valid
message types include:
.BR M_DATA ", " M_PROTO " and " M_PCPROTO );
or, the message at head of the of the queue is not of the requested type
as specified by
.IR flagsp ,
or priority band as specified by
.IR bandp .
.PP
Other errors may be returned by
.BR getpmsg ().
If the protocol module sends a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message to the stream head, the error returned on all subsequent read
operations, including
.BR getpmsg (),
is specified in the
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message by the protocol module.
Which errors are returned under which conditions form part of the
necessary documentation of the protocol module.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.SS "Multi-Threading"
.PP
.BR getpmsg ()
is thread-safe; however, multiple threads performing concurrent partial reads
on the same stream will interfere with each other.  POSIX mandatory file
locks, (see
.BR lockf (3))
can be used to avoid interference.
.SS "Asynchronous I/O"
If the file is set for blocking operation (see
.BR fcntl (2)),
then
.BR getpmsg ()
will block waiting for a message to arrive on the stream head in the specified
.IR band .
When the file is set for non-blocking operation,
.BR getpmsg ()
will not block, but will return the appropriate error number
.RB ([EBADMSG "], [" ERESTARTSYS "], [" EAGAIN "], [" EWOULDBLOCK ])
if a message of the correct type and
.I band
was not immediately available for retrieval at the stream head.
