.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
are variants of
.BR sprintf (3),
that print according to a
.BR printf (3)
formatted format string into a buffer pointed to by
.IR mp .
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
begin printing characters at the
.I b_wptr
member of the last data block in the message pointed to by
.IR mp ;
however,
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr (),
trims one character from the end of the message,
.IR mp ,
before printing characters beings.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
would normally be used on a freshly allocated buffer,
.IR mp ,
that is to contain a formatted string.
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
would normally be used on a previously printed message buffer, 
where the trailing newline is to be stripped before printing is continued.
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
can be used to implement
.BR cmn_err (9)-like
functions or
.BR strlog (9)-like
functions.  However, asside from these two situations, there is very little
use for printing formatted strings to message blocks.
(Let me take that back: these functions in fact turn out to be useful for
formatting messages for text-based protocols such as SIP and MGCP from within
STREAMS kernel modules.)
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
or
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
succeed, they returns
the number of bytes written to the buffer;
when they fail, they return minus one
.RB ( -1 ).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
or
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
fail when the format string,
.I fmt
cannot be parsed correctly or there is not sufficient room in the passed in
message blocks and additional message blocks could not be allocated.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
or
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
can be called from any context, including interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
are MP -safe.
The caller, however, is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to the
passed in message buffers.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
are
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
functions:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _AIX_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
is implemented by providing a message block
.BR mi_putc ()
and
.BR mi_number ()
function and then using a fairly standard
.BR sprintf (3)
style implementation.
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
simply calls
.BI adjmsg( mp ",-1)
before calling
.BR mi_mpprintf ().

.\"
.SH BUGS

.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and

have no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
are
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
are
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR zzz ()
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
are provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
only provide functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_mpprintf ()
and
.BR mi_mpprintf_nr ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR aixcompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
