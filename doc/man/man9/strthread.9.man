.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B strthread
structure is an structure used internal to the
.I STREAMS
scheduler that is used to store information about a cpu-bound kernel thread
within the
.I STREAMS
executive.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.I STREAMS
kernel threads run at process context within the kernel.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
The
.B strthreads
array is per-CPU and does not require protection.
This is an internal scheduler structure and should not be manipulated directly.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B strthread
structures are not intended to be used directly by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.  It is only intended to be used directly by inlined
.I STREAMS
utilities.
.PP
Manipulating
.B strthread
structures without using
.I STREAMS
utility functions intended to do so, will likely cause panics and crash the
system.  Use proper
.I STREAMS
utility functions instead.

.BR runqueues (9).

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B strthread
contains information that was allocated statically within the kernel in
accordance with the descriptions for
.IR "SVR 4"
.[
svr4spg
.]
in the MG.

.]
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The
.B strthread
structure is consistent with the description of the internal static variables
associated with the
.I STREAMS
scheduler function of
.IR "SVR 4" .
