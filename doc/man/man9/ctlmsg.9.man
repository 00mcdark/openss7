.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int ctlmsg(int " type );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I type
the type to test against a data message type.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR ctlmsg ()
tests the passed in
.I type
to see if the type is a control message type.  Control message types include any message types other
than following:
.TP \w'M_PCPROTO(9)\(em\ 'u
.BR M_DATA (9)
The message type is a data message type.
.PD 0
.TP
.BR M_PROTO (9)
The message type is a protocol data message type.
.TP
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
The message type is a priority protocol data message type.
.PD
.PP
If the passed in message
.I type
is not one of these message types,
.BR ctlmsg ()
returns true (1); otherwise,
.BR ctlmsg ()
returns false (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR ctlmsg ()
returns true (1) if the passed in message type is a control message type.
.BR ctlmsg ()
returns false (0) if the passed in message type is not a control message type.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR ctlmsg ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR ctlmsg ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR ctlmsg ()
is MP-safe.

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR ctlmsg ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR ctlmsg ()
is source-level compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
svr4dk
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR ctlmsg ()
is widely supported.
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules may use this function.
.IP \(em
.BR ctlmsg ()
is implemented as an
.B extern inline
function.
.IP \(em
Some older implementations of
.IR "SunOS 4" \(rg
did not include
.BR M_DELAY (9)
in the group.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
