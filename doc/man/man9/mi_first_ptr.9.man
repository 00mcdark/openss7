.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mi_head
an opaque pointer representing the head of the open list.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
DDI.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
convenience function that assists with housekeeping during
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.BR I_LINK (7),
.BR I_PLINK (7),
or
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
operations.
The
.IR MPS \(rg
convenience functions, including
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
and
.BR mi_close_comm (9),
maintain a list of
.I STREAMS
driver or module instances in a list global to the driver or module.  Both
pushable module instances as well as device driver instances can be maintained
in the same list.
.PP
Pushable module instances are those instances that were added to the list with
.I sflag
set to
.B MODOPEN
on a call to
.BR mi_open_comm (9).
Device driver instances are those that were added to the list with
.I sflag
set to
.BR CLONEOPEN " or " DRVOPEN
on a call to
.BR mi_open_comm (9).
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
returns the first private structure pointer on the list specified by
.IR mi_list .
Subsequent members of the list can be interated over using the private
structure pointer returned by
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
and the
.BR mi_next_ptr (9)
function call.
.PP
If the list contains module instances, the module instances are returned
first, in the order in which they were allocated, and then driver instances
sorted by device number.
To obtain only driver instances, use the
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr (9)
call instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
is use to start an interation over a the private structure list that can be
continued with
.BR mi_next_ptr (9).
This is done when it is desired to iterate over all of the private structures
in an open list looking for a private structure with some characteristic.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
returns a pointer to the first private structure in the list.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
alway succeeds.
However, when passed an invalid pointer or a pointer to an invalid structure,
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
might destabilize the kernel or cause an immediate or delayed kernel panic.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
can be called from any context, but is normally called from within a
.I STREAMS
driver
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
is not MP-safe.  The private structure returned by the function could be
deleted before it is used by the caller.  The caller must use other global
locks around this and other functions that manipulate the list to provide
protection on MP architectures.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _AIX_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
simply returns the private structure pointer of the first item on the list or
.B NULL
if there are no items on the list.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR zzz ()
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_first_ptr ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR aixcompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
