.SH NAME
.B M_COPYIN
\- \fISTREAMS\fP copyin message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_COPYIN
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_COPYIN
message is a high priority message that consists of one
.B M_COPYIN
message block followed by one or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_COPYIN
is a high priority message
generated by a driver or module and sent upstream to request that the
Stream head
perform a
.BR copyin (9)
on behalf of the driver or module.  It is valid only after receiving an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message and before an
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
or
.BR M_IOCNAK (9),
for a given ioctl operation identifier,
.IR ioc_id .
.PP
.B M_COPYIN
is a high priority message that is not subject to flow control within a
Stream.
The format of the message is one
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
message block containing a
.BR copyreq (9)
structure, defined in
.BR <sys/stream.h> :
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct copyreq {
    int cq_cmd;         /* ioctl command (from ioc_cmd) */
    cred_t *cq_cr;      /* full credentials */
    uint cq_id;         /* ioctl id (from ioc_id) */
    caddr_t cq_addr;    /* address top copy data to/from */
    uint cq_size;       /* number of bytes to copy */
    int cq_flag;        /* SVR 3.2 compatibility */
    mblk_t *cq_private; /* private state information */
    long cq_filer[4];   /* reserved for future use */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
The first three members of the structure correspond to those of the
.BR iocblk (9)
structure in the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message block which allows the same message block to be reused for both structures.  The
Stream head
will guarantee that the message block allocated for the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message is large enough to contain a
.BR copyreq (9)
structure.  The
.I cq_addr
field contains the user space address from which the data are to be copied.  The
.I cq_size
field is the number of bytes to copy from user space.
.PP
The
.I cq_private
field can be used by a module to point to a message block containing the module's state information
relating to this
.BR ioctl (2s).
The
Stream head
will copy (without processing) the contents of this field to the
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
reponse message so that the module can resume the associated state.  If an
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
or
.BR M_COPYOUT (9)
message is freed,
.I STREAMS
will not free any message block pointed to by
.IR cq_private .
This is the module's responsibility.
.PP
The driver or module responding to a
.I tranparent
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message issues a
.B M_COPYIN
message when it wishes to copy data in from the user.  The message is formulated and issued
upstream to the
Stream head.
When reveived by the
Stream head,
the
Stream head
will attempt to copy in the requested amount of data of size
.IR cq_size ,
from the user address
.IR cq_addr ,
using the
.BR copyin (9)
utility.
.PP
If the
.BR copyin (9)
operation succeeds, the
Stream head
will reply with an
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message block whose
.I cp_rval
member is set to
.BR "(caddr_t)(0)" ,
and with attached
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks containing the copied in data.
.PP
If the
.BR copyin (9)
operation fails, the
Stream head
will reply with an
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message block whose
.I cp_rval
member is set to
.BR "(caddr_t)(1)" ,
to indicate the error, and then aborts the
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation and returns
.RB [ EFAULT ]
to the user in
.IR errno (3).
This provides the driver or module with the opportunity to clean up the
.I cq_private
pointer when the
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation is aborted.
.PP
See
.BR M_IOCDATA (9),
for more information.
.\"
.B M_COPYIN
messages cannot be directly generated by a user level process.
.B M_COPYIN
messages arriving at a non-multiplexing driver should be discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_COPYIN
messages may be generated by a driver or module that is responding to an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The following guidelines represent best practise for processing of the
.B M_COPYIN
message by drivers and modules:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Intermediate modules that do not intend to process this message will not queue the
.B M_COPYIN
message upstream.
In any event, an intermediate module must not flush or discard an
.B M_COPYIN
message.
.IP ""
As only one
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation, and therefore, one
.B M_COPYIN
message can be in progress on a Stream, queueing of the message would cause unnecessary delay in
processing a
.I transparent
.BR ioctl (2s).
Only one high priority message can be outstanding at the
Stream head,
so ordering of this message with respect to other high priority messages is not an issue.
.IP \(bu
Modules or drivers should only issue a
.B M_COPYIN
message as part of a
.I transparent
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation.
.IP \(bu
The message should be created by transforming a received
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message.
.IP \(bu
The driver or module issuing this message should attach all state information pertaining to the
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation using the
.I cq_private
pointer in the
.BR M_COPYIN
message block.
.IP ""
Issuing drivers or modules will consider in their design that a misbehaving module might flush or
discard the message.
.IP \(bu
The driver or module design can expect that an
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
reply to a
.B M_COPYIN
message will arrive reliably.  The queue pair's
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure will not be invoked until after the
.B M_IOCDATA (9)
message has been delivered to the module's
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following procedure fragment provides an example of handling of
.B M_COPYIN
messages on the read-side of an intermediate module.  Note that at
.IR "line 16" ,
.B M_COPYIN
(and
.BR M_COPYOUT (9))
messages are passed upstream without queuing.
