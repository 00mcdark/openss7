.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_acquire (),
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9),
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal (9),
and
.BR mi_release (9)
are a set of per queue pair Stream locking functions that can be used with the
functions from the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family.
.PP
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
attempts to lock the private structure associated with the pointer,
.IR *ptrp .
When successful, the function returns a pointer to the private structure.
When the lock cannot be immediately required, the calling process is put to sleep awaiting the
release of the lock and awoken either on a signal, upon acquiring the lock, or upon pointer,
.IR *ptrp ,
becoming
.BR NULL .
When unsuccessful (the process is interrupted by a signal, or pointer
.IR *ptrp ,
has become
.BR NULL ),
the function returns
.BR NULL .
.PP
.B mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
acts as does
.B mi_acquire_sleep (),
except that the sleep will not be interrupted by a signal.
.PP
Before sleeping, if the lock pointer,
.IR lockp ,
is
.RB non- NULL ,
the lock will be unlocked for write before the sleep and locked again for write after the sleep.  If
the flags word pointer,
.IR flagsp ,
is also
.RB non- NULL ,
flags will be restored and saved in the flags word when unlocking and locking.
After reacquiring the lock, the private structure pointer,
.IR *ptrp ,
will be rechecked for
.BR NULL .
When the function exits, the lock, if provided, will be write locked and any flags stored in the
flags word pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
and
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
simplify the implementation of private structure locks for fully MP-SAFE
.IR STREAMS (9)
modules and drivers.  The functions attempt to lock the private structure associated with pointer,
.IR *ptrp ,
and serialize access to the associated private structure.  While the lock is held, access to the
private structure is exclusive to the lock holder.
.PP
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
are called during a open or close routine when the routine wishes exclusive access to the private
structure (perhaps to alter state variables).
.PP
When
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
fail to acquire the lock, the caller will sleep.  When the lock is released by the current lock
holder, the sleeping process will be woken.
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
will also be woken by a signal.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
succeed, they returns a pointer to the locked private structure associated with pointer,
.IR *ptrp ;
when unsucessful, it returns
.BR NULL .
When
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
fail, it fails either because a signal was caught, or the pointer,
.IR *ptrp ,
has become
.BR NULL .
The caller can determine which by testing
.IR *ptrp
for
.BR NULL.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
fails and returns
.B NULL
when the process' sleep is interrupted by a signal.
When
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
fails and returns
.BR NULL ,
the caller has the option of simply reinvoking
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
and
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
can be called from any blockable context, including user context, and module open and close
procedures.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
and
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
are MP-safe, however, the caller is responsible for ensuring the validity of the passed in pointers
across the call.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
must only be called for a private structure that was allocated with
.BR mi_alloc (9)
or
.BR mi_alloc_sleep (9),
or one of the other private structure allocation functions from the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family of functions.
.PP
Any queue that uses
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9)
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal (9)
should have a queue service procedure.
.PP
Each successful call to
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
must be matched with a corresponding call to
.BR mi_release (9)
or processor or process deadlock may occur.
.PP
The lock acquired by
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
on the private structure associated with pointer,
.IR *ptrp ,
is not a recursive lock.  That is, if
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
is called twice for the same pointer,
.IR *ptrp ,
and with no intervening
.BR mi_release (9),
and the first call to
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
succeeds, the second call will sleep indefinitely  This is the best behaviour for
.IR STREAMS (9)
open and close procedures which are seldomly written with reentrancy in mind.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
and
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
are implemented using synchronization variable lock functions.  See
.BR SV_WAIT_SIG (9)
and
.BR SV_WAIT (9)
for more information.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
and
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
are
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
and
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
are OpenSS7 Project specific implementations of an
.IR MPS \(rg-compatible
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
and
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
are provided for use with SS7 drivers and modules that need some automatic locking of queue pair
private structure for speed and efficiency.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_acquire_sleep ()
and
.BR mi_acquire_sleep_nosignal ()
do not exist in any other
.IR MPS \(rg
implementation other than
.IR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
