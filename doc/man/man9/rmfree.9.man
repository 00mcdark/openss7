.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I map
a pointer to a
.B struct map
structure that was previously initialized by a call to
.BR rminit (9).
.TP
.I size
the number of units to allocate.
.TP
.I addr
the address at which to free the previously allocated space.
.TP
.I index
the index of the first unit of the allocated resource.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR rmfree ()
frees
.I size
units to the given resource map,
.IR map .
In a map, the addresses are increasing, and the list is terminated by a zero
size.  The actual units managed by the map are arbitrary and can be map
registers, bytes, blocks, and so forth.
.PP
.BR rmfree ()
is used to free space previously allocated with
.BR rmalloc (9)
or
.BR rmalloc_wait (9).

.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR rmfree ()
returs void.
.PP
When
.B _OSF_SOURCE
is defined,
.BR rmfree ()
accepts a
.B long
.I size
argument
and a
.B Long
.I addr
argument.
.PP
When
.B _SUN_SOURCE
or
.B _UW7_SOURCE
is defined
.BR rmfree ()
accepts a
.B size_t
.I size
argument
and a
.B ulong_t
.I index
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When 
.BR rmfree ()
fails it fails silently.
.BR rmfree ()
fails when the specified map overflows.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR rmfree ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR rmfree ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to
the passed in map structure.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR rmfree ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR rmfree ()
is source-level compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
and
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
provide
.BR rmfree ().
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
do not document
.BR rmfree ().
.IP \(em
The
.IR AIX \(rg
PSE (Portable STREAMS Environment) does not support
.BR rmalloc (),
.BR rmalloc_wait (),
.BR rminit (9)
or
.BR rmfree (9).
On
.IR AIX \(rg
.BR rmalloc (),
and
.BR rmfree ()
are different functions that allocate and free \*(lqreal memory\*(rq rather than from a
\*(lqresource map\*(rq.
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
provide a function prototype
taking a
.I size
argument of type
.BR size_t
and a
.I index
argument of type
.BR ulong_t .
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
provides a function prototype
.B long
taking a
.I size
argument of type
.BR long
and a
.I addr
argument of type
.BR long .
.IR UXP/V
does not document the function prototype.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

.BR STREAMS (9)
