.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR min ()
returns the minimum of the two integers
.IR a " and " b .

.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR min ()
is a basic function that is used to determine the minimum of two integers.

.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR min ()
returns the minimum of the two integers
.IR a " and " b .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR min ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR min ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR min ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
There are other versions of this function (or macro) avaliable from the
.B Linux
kernel.
.PP
.BR min ()
should not be used to compare unsigned sequence numbers.
.PP
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will only use
.BR min ()
to compare two integers.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR min ()
is implemented as an
.B extern inline
function as follows:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
#undef min
__EXTERN_INLINE int min(int a, int b)
{
    return ((a < b) ? a : b);
}

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR min ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR min ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR min ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR min ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR min ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

.BR STREAMS (9)
