.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.IR MPS \(rg
supplies robust timer services that are synchronized with the
.I STREAMS
environment.  Timer services are supported by using special
.I STREAMS
messages.  The function
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is used to create one of these special
.I STREAMS
messages.
.PP
Calling
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
will create a
.I STREAMS
timer message of the requested size, that is targeted to the specified
.I STREAMS
queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is one of a set of timer functions including
.BR mi_timer (9),
.BR mi_timer_alloc (),
.BR mi_timer_cancel (9),
.BR mi_timer_free (9),
.BR mi_timer_move (9),
.BR mi_timer_q_switch (9),
.BR mi_timer_stop (9),
.BR mi_timer_valid (9),
that are used to abstract the kernel timer functions and provide
synchronization with
.I STREAMS
message queues.
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is responsible for initial allocation of a timer and association of the timer
with a message block and a queue upon which the message block will be placed
when the timer expires.
See
.BR mi_timer (9)
for more detailed usage information.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
succeeds, it returns the allocated message block associated with the timer;
when it fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
fails when it is unable to immediately allocate a message block to associated
with the timer.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
can be called from any context, however, it is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.BR qi_qopen (9)
routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is MP-safe.  The caller has exclusive access to the returned message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _SUN_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.I STREAMS
message allocated has type
.BR M_PCSIG (9).
A private data structure is hidden between
.I mp->b_datap->db_base
and
.IR mp->b_rptr .

.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common memory allocation functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR suncompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
