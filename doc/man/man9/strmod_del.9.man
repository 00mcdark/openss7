.BR strmod_del ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
for the purpose of porting

drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for

differ from that of

.BR strmod_del ()
only provides functionality comparable to

drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by

devices are not supported.
