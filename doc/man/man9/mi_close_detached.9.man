.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached ()
and
.BR mi_close_detached_cache ()
are called from a
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_qclose (9)
or
.B I_UNLINK
procedure to free the instance data and perform additional housekeeping.
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached ()
must only be called on instance data that was previously allocated with
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
and detached with
.BR mi_detach (9),
or allocated with
.BR mi_open_detached (9).
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached_cache ()
must only be called on instance data that was previously allocated with
.BR mi_open_comm_cache (9)
and detached with
.BR mi_detach (9),
or allocated with
.BR mi_open_detached_cache (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached (9)
is typically used in conjunction with
.BR mi_open_detached (9)
or
.BR mi_detach (9).
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached_cache (9)
is typically used in conjunction with
.BR mi_open_detached_cache (9)

.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_close_detached ()
and
.BR mi_close_detached_cache ()
succeed, they return 
.BR true  " (1);
when they fail, they return
.BR false " (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached ()
and
.BR mi_close_detached_cache ()
fail when the associated detached private structure does not exist.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached ()
and
.BR mi_close_detached_cache ()
can be called from any context, however, they are intended to be called from
process context and then within the
.BR qi_qclose (9)
procedure of a
.I STREAMS
driver or module.

.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached ()
and
.BR mi_close_detached_cache ()
is MP-safe when called from process context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached ()
and
.BR mi_close_detached_cache ()
are
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
functions:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _AIX_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose these symbols.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached ()
simply calls
.BR mi_close_free (9).
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached_cache ()
simply calls
.BR mi_close_free_cache (9).

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_close_detached ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common memory allocation functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_close_detached ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_close_detached ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_close_detached ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR aixcompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
.PP
.BR mi_close_detached_cache ()
is an
.I OpenSS7 Project
specific implementation of
.BR mi_close_detached ()
that is inherently non-portable.  While it is fairly straightforward to implement tehse in any
Mentat implementation present on modern day UNIX systems, it requires exposing internals to the MPS
implementation that might not be desirable.
