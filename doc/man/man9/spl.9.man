.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These functions can be used to alter the system priority level.  The system
priority level is an abstraction of the interrupt context of the processor
on which the function is executed.  When the current priority level is
.IR pl-x ,
then no thread of execution running at priority level
.IR pl-y ,
can be running, where
.IR pl-y " <= " pl-x .
.PP
Any of the
.BR spl ()
functions, with the exception of
.BR splx (),
will only result in raising or maintaining the system priority level;
.BR splx ()
can will only result in lowering or maintaining the system priority level.
When
.BR spl ()
is passed minus one
.RB ( -1 )
as the level,
.IR level ,
then no change is made to the priority level, but the current priority level is
still returned.  In this way, the current priority level can be determined.
.PP
All of the
.BR spl ()
functions, except
.BR splx (),
return the priority level that was in effect before the
.BR spl ()
function was called.
.BR splx ()
restores a previous priority level and returns
.BR void .
.PP
.BR splbase (),
.BR spldisk (),
.BR splhi (),
.BR splstr (),
.BR spltimeout ()
and
.BR spltty ()
are equivalent to
.BI spl( plbase ),
.BI spl( pldisk ),
.BI spl( plhi ),
.BI spl( plstr )
and
.BI spl( pltimeout ).
.PP
.BR splbase (),
.BR spldisk (),
.BR splhi (),
.BR splstr (),
.BR spltimeout ()
and
.BR spltty ()
are also equivalent to
.BR spl0 (),
.BR spl6 (),
.BR spl7 (),
.BR spl5 (),
.BR spl4 (),
and
.BR spl3 ().

.SH USAGE
.PP
The following code snippet illustrates the use of the
.BR spl ()
functions:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1{
    pl_t save_pl = splstr();

    /* do some stuff */

    splx(save_pl);
}\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
The following code snippet illustrates how to obtain the current priority
level using
.BR spl ():
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1{
    pl_t current_pl = spl(-1);

    /* do some stuff */
}\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When the
.BR spl ()
function, other than
.BR splx (),
succeed, they sets the calling processor's priority level and returns
the priority level that was in effect prior to the call;
when they fails, they return
.BR invpl .
.PP
When the
.BR splx ()
function succeeds, it restores the specified priority level and returns
.BR void ;
when it fails, it fails silently.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR spl ()
functions fail when it is not possible to set the specified priority level.
.PP
.BR splx ()
fails when the specified
.I level
is invalid.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR spl ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR spl ()
functions are MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR spl ()
and family are
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
functions:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose these symbols.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR spl ()
functions use a combination of eneable or disabling using local bottom half suppression and hard irq
suppression.
.\"

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR spl ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR spl ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR spl ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR spl ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR spl ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
