.SH NAME

\- remove a message from a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void rmvq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue from which to remove the message.
.PD 0
.TP
.I mp
the message to remove from the queue.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
removes the message pointed to by
.I mp
from the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
The message can be removed from the middle of the queue and does not need to
be at the head or tail of the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The following rules govern the usage of the
.BR rmvq (9)
utility:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
.BR rmvq (9),
must not be passed a queue pointer that was not frozen by the caller with a previous call to
.BR freezstr (9).
.IP \(bu
.BR rmvq (9),
can be passed any queue pointer previously frozen by the caller with a call to
.BR freezestr (9),
regardless of the context of the call.
.PP
The above rules allow
.BR rmvq (9)
to be called on any queue properly frozen by the caller with
.BR freezestr (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.PP
The Stream containing
.I q
should be frozen by the caller with
.BR freezestr (9).
If the Strem is not frozen,
.BR rmgq ()
must be called from a
.I STREAMS
synchronous context (i.e.,
.IR qi_putp (9),
.IR qi_srvp (9),
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9)),
for an intermediate module, however, it may be called from an asynchronous context for a Stream end
(i.e., no
.I q->q_next
pointer).
See
.BR qbackenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access
to the passed in message pointer,
.IR mp .
.PP
One way to ensure exclusive access to the message pointer prior to the call is to freeze the state
of the queue before the reference to
.I mp
is acquired.  This can be accomplished by using
.BR freezestr (9)
for the queue, priori to acquiring
.IR mp .
.PP
Another way to ensure exclusive access to the message pointer prior to the call is to create a
situation whereby the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure cannot run.  This is the state of affairs when the
calling process has frozen the entire stream with a function such as
.BR qwriter (9),
or simply the queue with a function such as
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
uses a
.BR queue (9)
structure pointer in the
.BR msgb (9)
structure to determine to which queue (if any)
.I mp
belongs.  This increases the performance of the
.BR rmvq ()
function dramatically.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4dk
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR rmvq ()
does not panic if the message pointer,
.IR mp ,
points to a message not on queue,
.IR q .
.IP ""
.IR IRIX \(rg
documents that if the message pointer,
.IR mp ,
does not point to an existing message on queue,
.IR q ,
that the system could panic.
.[
irixdoc
.]
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not pass a message,
.IR mp ,
to
.BR rmvq ()
that is not on the passed in queue,
.IR q .
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
require that a stream be frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
for the duration of the call to
.BR rmvq ().
.[

.]
.[
suxspg
.]
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will freeze the stream with
.BR freezestr (9)
before calling
.BR rmvq ().
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
lists
.BR rmvq ()
as a function that can only be passed a queue in the queue pair currently
being synchronized within a module procedure.
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
also lists
.BR rmvq ()
as a utility that cannot be called from user functions or
.RI non- STREAMS
code; that is, contexts asynchronous to the Stream containing
.IR q .
.IP ""
.IR HP-UX \(rg
compatible drivers and modules will not call
.BR rmvq ()
from outside of a
.BR qinit (9)
routine for the queue pair of
.IR q .
.IP \(em
.BR rmvq ()
cannot be called from an interrupt service routine.
.IP ""
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
does not permit
.BR rmvq ()
to be called from an interrupt service routine context to remove the need for suppressing
local interrupts throughout the
.I STREAMS
executive.  The only queue procedure that
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
permits to be called from an interrupt service routine context is
.BR put (9),
and that function defers until the next
.BR runqueues (9)
pass.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not call
.BR rmvq ()
from any context outside a
.I STREAMS
queue procedure or callback function.  At the Stream end (Stream head or driver), from a context
other than a
.I STREAMS
coroutine, only
.BR put (9)
will be used by a portable
.I STREAMS
driver or module.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

.BR STREAMS (9)
