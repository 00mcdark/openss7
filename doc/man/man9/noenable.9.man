.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void noenable(queue_t *" q ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to suppress scheduling.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR noenable ()
sets the
.B QNOENB
flag on the specified queue,
.IR q .
This tells the
.I STREAMS
scheduler that the queue not be enabled (scheduled for service by
.BR runqueues (9))
when a
.I ordinary priority
message is enqueued by
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9),
or which any message is enqueued by
.BR insq (9).
.BR noenable ()
has no effect on the enabling of queues (scheduling of queue
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures) when the queue is
back-enabled,
when
.BR qenable (9)
is called explicitly,
or when a message of a
.I high priority
message type is enqueued with
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9).
.PP
.BR noenable ()
can be cancelled with
.BR enableok (9).
If
.BR noenable ()
has been called for a queue and
.BR enableok (9)
has not subsequently been called for the same queue, a second call to
.BR noenable ()
for the queue will have no effect.
Whether a queue has been disabled with a call to
.BR noenable ()
can be tested with
.BR canenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR noenable ()
can be used to temporarily suspend queue
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure processing for a
queue for
.I ordinary priority
messages enqueued with
.BR putq (9)
and
.BR putbq (9),
and any messages enqueued with
.BR insq (9).
This permits data messages to be enqueued with
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9),
and any message to be enqueued with
.BR insq (9),
without enabling the queue (invoking the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure).
.PP
This facility can be used to provide message coalescing capabilities on read or write queues.
For example, multiple messages can be enqueued by a queue's
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure without invoking the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure until a criteria is met.
Once the a sufficient time period has elapsed, or once a sufficient number of bytes have been
enqueued, the
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure, or a
.BR timeout (9)
callback, can explicitly invoke the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure with
.BR qenable (9).
The queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure, thus invoked, may coalesce smaller messages into larger ones.
.PP
Canonical processing in the Line Discipline,
.BR ldterm (4),
module can use this capability to perform a similar function.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR noenable ()
sets the
.B QNOENB
flag and returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR noenable ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR noenable ()
does not remove the queue from the current
.BR runqueues (9)
schedule list.  It only sets the
.B QNOENB
flag to indicate whether the queue should be subsequently scheduled.
To stop a queue from being scheduled, use
.BR qprocsoff (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR noenable ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR noenable ()
is MP-safe.
.BR noenable ()
uses atomic bit operations and does not write lock the queue.  Therefore,
.BR noenable ()
can be called for a queue that has been frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
No global locks need to be held across a call to
.BR noenable ()
and
.BR noenable ()
takes no locks.
.PP
If one thread disables a queue with
.BR noenable ()
and another enables the queue with
.BR enableok (9),
there will be a race condition on the
.B QNOENB
flag.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR noenable ()
is compatible with

and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
svr4spg
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The function of
.BR noenable ()
on all implementations is presumably the same:
.BR noenable ()
simply sets the
.B QNOENB
flag in the
.I q_flag
member of the
.BR queue (9)
structure.  It is the effect of setting this flag on other
.I STREAMS
utility functions and the
.I STREAMS
scheduler and flow control mechanisms that tend to differ, at least in the documentation.
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
uses atomic bit operations and does not require taking the queue write lock.
This makes
.BR noenable ()
safe for use on a write locked stream that has been frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).

.IR SUPER-UX \(rg

.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
solspg

permits
.BR noenable ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not invoke
.BR noenable ()
on a stream that has previously been frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
does not suppress the scheduling of queues when back-enabling is performed,
when
.BR qenable (9)
is explicitly called, or when
.I high priority
messages are enqueued with
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9).
.IP ""

state that
.BR noenable ()
disables the scheduling of queues resulting from a
.I ordinary priority
message being placed on the queue with
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9)
and that it disables scheduling of queues resulting from any message being
placed on the queue with

.\".IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg

does not talk about
.BR insq (9)
behaviour.
.\".IP \(em
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not rely upon the behaviour of
.BR insq (9)
with regard to
.I high priority
messages when
.BR noenable ()
is in effect.
The best practice is to explicitly enable, using
.BR qenable (9),
the queue immediately after a
.I high priority
message is inserted into the queue with
.BR insq (9);
thus yielding like behaviour across all these systems.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
