.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'\fIpriority\fR\(em'u
.I event
The event (kernel address) on which to sleep.
.PD 0
.TP
.I priority
The priority at which to run when awoken.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR sleep ()
suspends execution of a process to await certain events such as reaching a
known system state in hardware or software.  For instance, when a process
wants to read a device a no data are available, the driver may need to call
.BR sleep ()
to wait for data to become available before returning.  This causes the kernel
to suspend execution of the currently running process and schedule another
process.  The process that called sleep can be resumed by a call to the
.BR wakeup (9)
function with the same
.I event
as specified in the call to
.BR sleep ().
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.I event
argument address has no significance except that the same address must be
passed to
.BR wakeup (9)
to resume the sleeping process.  The address used should be the address of a
kernel data structure associated with the caller, or one of the caller's own
data structures.  Use of an arbitrary address not associated with a private
data structure can result in a conflict with another, unrelated sleep and
wakeup operations in the kernel.
.PP
The
.I priority
argument can have valid values from zero
.RB ( 0 )
through thirty-nine
.RB ( 39 )
inclusive.  In general, a lower value will result in more favorable scheduling
although the exact semantic of the priority argument is specific to the
scheduling class of the caller, and some scheduling classes may choose to
ignore the argument altogether for the purpose of assigning a scheduling
priority.
.PP
Also, the value of the
.I priority 
argument determines whether the sleep may be interrupted by signals.  If the
value of
.I priority
is less than or equal to the value of the constant
.BR PZERO ,
the sleeping process will not be awakened by a signal.  If the value of
.I priority
is greater than
.B PZERO
and the
.B PCATCH
bit flag is ORed into the
.I priority
argument, the process will wake up prematurely (without a call to
.BR wakeup (9))
upon receipt of a non-ignored, non-held signal and will normally return
one
.RB ( 1 )
to the calling code.  If
.I priority
is greater than
.B PZERO
and
.B PCATCH
is not set, the sleeping process will exit upon receipt of a signal and will
never return to the caller.
.PP
Calls to
.BR sleep ()
must be able to tolerate premature wakeups.  After it is awakened, the code
must reexamine the condition on which it was sleeping.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR sleep ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 )
if the caller woke due to a
.BR wakeup ()
or was stopped and restarted due to job control.  If the sleep is interrupted
by a signal and
.B PCATCH
was set in
.IR priority ,
the call returns one
.RB ( 1 ).
If the calling process catches a signal an
.B PCATCH
is not set, the call never returns.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR sleep ()
always succeeds.
.BR sleep ()
exits when the sleep is interrupted by a signal and
.B PCATCH
was set in the
.I priority
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR sleep ()
can be called from any blocking context.  Private locks cannot be held across
the call.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR sleep ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR sleep ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
