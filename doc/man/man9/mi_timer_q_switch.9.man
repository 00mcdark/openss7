.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
switches the timer message,
.IR mp ,
from its current queue to the new queue specified by the
.I q
argument.
Because it might not be possible to cancel the current timer,
.IR mp ,
a new timer message,
.IR new_mp ,
must be provided to the function for use the case that
.IR mp ,
cannot be cancelled.
.B mi_timer_q_switch ()
will return the pointer to the message that represents the new timer.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
is similar to
.BR mi_timer_move (9);
however,
.BR mi_timer_move (9)
is far easier to use.
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
can be used in the same circumstances as
.BR mi_timer_move (9),
that is, whenever it is desired to move timers from their original targeted
queue to a new one.
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
is a little more cumbersome in that it requires the pre-allocation of a
fallback timer message, should it be impossible to cancel the existing one,
and the handling of the disposition of these timer messages after the call
returns.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
returns a pointer to the new timer message block (either
.IR mp " or " new_mp ).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
is always successful.  If
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
is passed
.B NULL
or invalid pointers, or pointers to invalid structures, as arguments, the
kernel may become unstable and a kernel panic may ensue.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
can be called from any context; however, it is intended to be called from a
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure, or
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
is MP-safe.  It uses atomic exchanges to guarantee atomicity of timer state.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _AIX_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
attempts to cancel the existing timer message,
.IR mp ,
using
.BR mi_timer_cancel (9).
If the timer was cancelled and is not queued, it is restarted using
.BR mi_timer (9)
for the time remaining on the timer but with the new queue as a target, and
the existing message pointer will be returned.
.PP
If the timer message,
.IR mp ,
was queued at the time that it was cancelled, the new timer message will be
started for the time remaining on the timer at cancellation and the new
message pointer will be returned.

.SH BUGS

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR timeout (9)
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_timer_q_switch ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR aixcompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
