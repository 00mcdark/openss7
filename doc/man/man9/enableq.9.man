.\"

.SH NAME
.B enableq
\- schedules a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue service procedure
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int enableq(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue to enable.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR enableq ()
schedules the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure of the queue pointed to by
.I q
to be run by
.BR runqueues (9).
If the queue pointed to by
.I q
does not have a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
proceedure (i.e.
.I q->q_info->qi_srvp
is
.BR NULL )
or has been disabled with a call to
.BR noenable (9),
then
.BR enableq ()
will fail to schedule the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
Whether the queue can be scheduled with
.BR enableq ()
can be determined to some degree with a call to
.BR canenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR enableq ()
is normally called to indirectly invoke the execution of
.IR q 's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR enableq ()
successfully schedules the queue
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure with
.BR qschedule (9),
it returns true (1).  When
.BR enableq ()
fails to schedule the queue
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure, it returns false (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR enableq ()
fails and returns false (0)
if the
.B QNOENB
flag was set by
.BR noenable (9)
for the queue,
.IR q ,
or if the queue has no
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure
.RI ( q->q_info->qi_srvp
is
.BR NULL ).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR enableq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR enableq ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
If the queue was not already enabled
.RI ( qi_srvp (9)
procedure already scheduled to run) on a different CPU,
.BR enableq ()
schedules the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure of
.I q
on the current CPU.  In this case, the queue
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure for
.I q
will not execute until after
.BR enableq ()
returns and the function that called
.BR enableq ()
returns or encounters a preemption point.
However, if the queue is already scheduled by another processor  and
.BR enableq ()
was not called from a context synchronous with the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure, another
processor may run the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure before
.BR enableq ()
returns.
.PP
Therefore,
.BR enableq ()
should be called with
.I STREAMS
synchronization in effect, or hold the necessary private locks across the
call to
.BR enableq (),
if it is ncessary to synchronize the call to
.BR enableq ()
with execution of the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR enableq ()
fails and returns false (0) if
.B QNOENB
is set.
.PP
If the queue has already been enabled due to internal
.I STREAMS
scheduler actions, or a previous call to
.BR qschedule (9)
that has not yet completed service,
.BR enableq ()
will have no effect.
.PP
Enabling a queue from within its own service procedure,
.IR qi_srvp (9),
will not reschedule the service procedure.

.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR enableq ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR enableq ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR enableq ()
will only schedule the queue for later service.

Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
