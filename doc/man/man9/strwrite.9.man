.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
perform
.BR write (2s)
functions on a Stream head.
.BR strwrite ()
is implemented with a call to
.BR strwritev ().
.\"
.\"
.\".SH USAGE
.\".PP
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
return a zero or positive number of bytes written.  This number will not be greater than the number of
bytes requested,
.IR nbytes ,
or the sum of the
.I iov_len
fields of the passed in
.B iovec
structures.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
return an appropriate negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
return a negative error number, under the following conditions:
.TP \w'[\fBERESTARTSYS\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EBADF ]
.I file
is not open for writing.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I file
refers to a Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure that is for a Stream that is linked (directly or indirectly) downstream from a
multiplexing driver.
(That is, the Stream had has the
.B STPLEX
bit set.)
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
.I file
refers to a Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure that is for a Stream that has closed or is closing.  (That is, eith there is no longer a
Stream head associated with
.I file
or the Stream head has the
.B STRCLOSE
bit set.)
.TP
.RB [ ERESTARTSYS ]
A signal arrived before the
.BR strwrite ()
or
.BR strwritev ()
call blocked, interrupting completion of the system call.  No action has been taken nor write data
transferred.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
A signal arrived after the call blocked, interrupting completion of the system call.  No action has
been taken nor write data transferred.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
.I file
is open for non-blocking operation (i.e. the
.BR O_NONBLOCK " (or " O_NDELAY )
file status flag is set), and the write operation would otherwise block awaiting the abatement of
flow control on priority band zero
.BR ( 0 ).
.TP
.RB [ EWOULDBLOCK ]
Same as
.RB [ EAGAIN ].
.TP
.RB [ ETIME ]
.I file
is open for blocking operation (i.e. the
.BR O_NONBLOCK " (and " O_NDELAY )
file status flag is clear), and the write operation blocked awaiting the abatement of flow control
on priority band zero
.BR ( 0 ),
and the wait timed out.
.PP
Also, if the Stream head referenced by
.I file
has received a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message indicating a write side error, then the write error from the message will be returned by
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
as a negative error number.
.\"
.PP
When the
.BR STRISFIFO " or " STRISPIPE
flags are clear in the
.I sd_flags
member of the Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure associated with
.IR file ,
the behaviour of
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
is appropriate for
.I STREAMS
character device special files.  In that case, the following additional error conditions can occur:
.TP \w'[\fBERESTARTSYS\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ ENXIO ]
.I file
refers to a Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure that is for a Stream that has received a hangup
.RB ( M_HANGUP (9))
message.  (That is, the Stream head has the
.BR STRHUP
bit set.)
.\"
.PP
When the
.BR STRISFIFO " or " STRISPIPE
flags are set in the
.I sd_flags
member of the Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure associated with
.IR file ,
the behaviour of
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
is appropriate for
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes and FIFOs.  In that case, the following additional error conditions can occur:
.TP \w'[\fBERESTARTSYS\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EPIPE ]
.I file
refers to a Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure that is for a Stream that has received a hangup
.RB ( M_HANGUP (9))
message.  (That is, the Stream head has the
.BR STRHUP
bit set.)
It is a typical implementation of
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes that a
.BR M_HANGUP (9)
message is sent to the other side before closing.
.TP
.RB [ EPIPE ]
.I file
refers to a
.IR STREAMS -based
FIFO and there are no process that have the FIFO open for read.
.TP
.RB [ EPIPE ]
.I file
refers to a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe and the other end has disconnected, is has closed, or is closing, or in any event there is no
process that has the other end of the pipe open for read.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
are called by the kernel in process context in response to a
.BR write (2s)
or
.BR writev (2s)
system call issued by a process.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
are MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.IR AIX \(rg
implements a
.BR wantio (9)
capability where a cooperating downstream driver or module can intercept file operations for
.I STREAMS
files and
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes and FIFOs.  If the
.BR wantio (9)
capability is utilized by a downstream driver or module, that module's provided
.BR strwrite ()
or
.BR strwritev ()
procedures will be used instead of those described here.  The procedures described here are still
available to the cooperating driver or module for callout.  Use of the
.BR wantio (9)
capability will affect the behaviour of
.BR write (2s),
making it potentially incompatible.

.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR strwrite ()
and
.BR strwritev ()
have no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.\"
.PP
.BR strwrite ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
and systems based on
