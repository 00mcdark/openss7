.HP
.BI "int copyout(const void *" from ", void *" to ", size_t " len );

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I from
a pointer to kernel memory where data is to be copied from.
.PD 0
.TP
.I to
a pointer to user memory where data is to be copied to.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR copyout ()
verifies that
.I len
bytes of memory at current user-space address
.I to
are valid for write and then copies those bytes from the kernel address
.IR from .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR copyout ()
copies the requested bytes and
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR copyout ()
does nothing but return a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR copyout ()
does nothing but return an appropriate negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'\ [EFAULT]\ 'u
.RB [ EFAULT ]
the buffer specified by
.IR from " and " len
extends outside the user's valid address space.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR copyout ()
can only be called from user context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR copyout ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access
to the kernel memory to which data is being copied.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR copyout ()
simply calls the Linux
.BR copy_to_user (9)
function, with the first two arguments reversed.
If optimization is used, the call is inline.
