.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
There are two functions with different prototypes defined for
.BR str_install (),
each defined by
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixspg
.]
and
.IR HPUX \(rg,
.[
hpuxspg
.]
with somewhat different behaviour and requirements.
.PP
When
.B _AIX_SOURCE
is defined before including header files, the
.IR AIX \(rg
version is used by definining symbol
.BR str_install ()
to
.BR str_install_AIX (9).
When
.B _HPUX_SOURCE
is defined before including header files, the
.IR HPUX \(rg
version is used by definining symbol
.BR str_install ()
to
.BR str_install_HPUX (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Both versions of
.BR str_install ()
return zero (0) upon success and a non-zero (positive) error code upon
failure.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When either version of
.BR str_install ()
fails, it returns a positive error code.  See
.BR str_install_AIX (9)
or
.BR str_install_HPUX (9)
for error codes pertaining to each version of the function.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR str_install ()
should be called from User (process) Context.
.BR str_install ()
is intended to be called by kernel module initialization routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR str_install ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR str_install ()
is an
.IR AIX \(rg-
or
.IR HPUX \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _AIX_SOURCE " or " _HPUX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIGE_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ", " CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_HPUX ", " CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE " or " CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_HPUX_MODULE
defined.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR str_install_AIX (9),
.BR str_install_HPUX (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS

has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
For specific compatibility of each version of the function, see
.BR str_install_AIX (9)
or
.BR str_install_HPUX (9).
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
