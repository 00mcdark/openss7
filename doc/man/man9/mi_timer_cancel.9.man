.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
a pointer to the message block associated with the timer.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
DDI.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
will cancel an outstanding timer message,
.IR mp ;
which must be a pointer to a timer message previously allocated by a call to
.BR mi_timer_alloc (9).
The
.I mp
message pointer will not be destroyed, but will no longer be delivered to the target queue.  It may
be rescheduled by using
.BR mi_timer (9)
at a later time.
.PP
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
is simply another name for
.BR mi_timer_cancel ().
Otherwise, the function are identical.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
are two of a set of timer functions including
.BR mi_timer (9),
.BR mi_timer_alloc (9),
.BR mi_timer_cancel (),
.BR mi_timer_free (9),
.BR mi_timer_move (9),
.BR mi_timer_q_switch (9),
.BR mi_timer_stop (),
.BR mi_timer_valid (9),
that are used to abstract the kernel timer functions and provide
synchronization with
.I STREAMS
message queues.
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
are responsible for cancelling a running timer.  If the timer is cancelled
before it was queued, it will not be queued should the timer expire.  If the
timer was cancelled after it was queued,
.BR mi_timer_valid (9)
will indicate that the timeout is invalid.
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
or
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
can be effected by passing
.BR mi_timer (9)
special time values.
See
.BR mi_timer (9)
for more detailed usage information.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
returns
.BR void .
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
returns true (1) when the timer is guaranteed to not be on a queue at the time
of the cancel and can be reused; and false (0) when the timer message cannot
be reused (because it may be on a queue).  This return value is used by
.BR mi_timer_q_switch (9)
internally.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
are always successful.  However, if passed a
.B NULL
or invalid pointer, or a pointer to an invalid structure, the kernel may
become unstable and a kernel panic may ensue.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
can be called from any context; however, they are intended to be called from a
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure or routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
are MP-safe.  Use of atomic exchanges is made within the data structures
contained within the timer message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
are
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _AIX_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
simply sets the state to
.B TB_CANCELLED
if the timer has timed out (is queued) or
.B TB_IDLE
if the timer has been cancelled before it was queued.
.PP
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
simply calls
.BR mi_timer_cancel ().

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
have no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
are
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
are
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR untimeout (9)
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
are provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_timer_cancel ()
and
.BR mi_timer_stop ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR aixcompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
