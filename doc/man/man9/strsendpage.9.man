.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR strsendpage ()
performs the
.BR sendfile (2)
function on a Stream head.
.BR strsendpage ()
is implemented directly as a
.BR sendpage ()
file operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR strsendpage ()
is not intended to be used directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules except as part of the
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixspg
.]
.BR wantio (9)
capability.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR strsendpage ()
returns zero or a positive value on success, and a negative error number on failure.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
See
.BR sendfile (2).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR strsendpage ()
is called by the kernel in process context in response to a
.BR sendfile (2)
system call issued by a process.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR strsendpage ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixspg
.]
implements a
.BR wantio (9)
capability where a cooperating downstream driver or module can intercept file operations for
.I STREAMS
files and
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes and FIFOs.  If the
.BR wantio (9)
capability is utilized by a downstream driver or module, that module's provided
.BR strsendpage ()
procedures will be used instead of those described here.  The procedures described here are still
available to the cooperating driver or module for callout.  Use of the
.BR wantio (9)
capability will affect the behaviour of
.BR sendfile (2),
making it potentially incompatible.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
For
.BR strsendpage ()
implementation details, see the
.I src/modules/sth.c
source file in the
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
distribution directory.

.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP

.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR strsendpage ()
has no known bugs.
.BR strsendpage ()
is an untested implementation.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR strsendpage ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
