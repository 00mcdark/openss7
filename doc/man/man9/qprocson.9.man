.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B qprocson
\- enables a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue for multi-processing
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "void qprocson(queue_t *" rq );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I rq
the read queue of the queue pair associated with the driver or module to turn
on procedures.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
enables the invocation of
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures for the queue pair whose
read queue pointer is pointed to by
.IR rq .
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
should be called before returning from the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure and before passing any messages with
.BR put (9s)
or
.BR putnext (9),
invoking callbacks with
.BR mi_bufcall (9),
.BR qbufcall (9)
or
.BR qtimeout (9)
and before executing
.BR qwait (9)
or
.BR qwait_sig (9).
.PP
It is not necessary to call
.BR qprocson ()
berfore returning from the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure if the driver or module does not intend to use the queue pair for receiving messages.
The driver or module should not call
.BR qprocson ()
if it is not the first open of the driver or module, or if the driver is redirecting the
open call to a different major device number.
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
is provided so that a driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure is able to prepare
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures from the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine before the
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures are invoked by upstream stream head, drivers or modules on either
queue in the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
can be called from any context, including user context, queue procedures, call-outs, callbacks, but
must not be called from soft interrupts or an interrupt service routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
should be called by the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure (i.e. in user context), on the first open of a stream, before returning.
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
must be called by the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure before performing any operations that place messages to or remove message from either
queue in the queue pair, regardless of whether the underlying architecture is UP or MP.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
must be called with a valid read queue pointer for a queue pair.
.BR qprocson ()
must not be called on a stream that is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.PP
Before a call to
.BR qprocson ()
a driver or module is only partially attached to a stream.  With procedures
turned off, any upstream or downstream module calling
.BR putnext (9)
will bypass the module.
After the explicit (or implicit) call to
.BR qprocson ()
the driver or module is fully inserted into the stream.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and system based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
svr4dk
.]
with the following porting considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qprocson ()
can be called with private queue pairs allocated with
.BR allocq (9).
This is a non-portable
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
enhancement.
.IP \(em
.BR qprocson ()
clears the
.I QPROCS
flag in the
.BR queue (9)
structure for both queues in the queue pair.
.BR qprocson ()
can be called repeatedly for the same queue pair and only the first call will
have an effect.  This can crash or lock processors on other systems (with the
exception of
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
as described below.)
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not call
.BR qprocson ()
repeatedly for the same stream without first calling
.BR qprocsoff (9).
.IP \(em
Although
.BR qprocson ()
is supposed to be called before returning from the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure,
on systems that support it,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
performs an implicit
.BR qprocson ()
upon return from
.IR qi_qopen (9)
in the case that
.BR qprocson ()
was not called before return.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will call
.BR qprocson ()
before returning (for the first open) from the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure.
.IP \(em
.BR qprocson ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
do not permit
.BR qprocson ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
