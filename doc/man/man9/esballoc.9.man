.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR esballoc ()
is used where the
.I STREAMS
driver needs control over the location, allocation and deallocation of data
buffers.  This may be because the data buffers are subject to some physical
contraints (e.g. must be allocated in DMA-able memory, or must exist in
dual-ported RAM or in a descriptor ring).  This may also be because some other
mechanism outside of
.I STREAMS
has already allocated and passed the data buffer to a
.I STREAMS
driver.
.PP
Where it is not necessary that the caller provide the data buffer,
.BR allocb (9)
is more appropriate.
.PP
.BR esballoc ()
allocates a message block and a data block using the caller supplied data
buffer at
.I base
of the specified
.IR size " and " priority .
.PP
The
.I priority
can be one of the following values:
.TP \w'\ BPRI_WAITOK\ 'u
.B BPRI_LO
The caller requests a low priority message buffer.
.PD 0
.TP
.B BPRI_MED
The caller requests a medium priority message buffer.
.TP
.B BPRI_HI
The caller requests a high priority message buffer.
.TP
.B BPRI_WAITOK
The caller requests a low priority message buffer and can block.
.PD
.PP
If
.BR esballoc ()
is called with a
.I priority
other than
.BR BPRI_LO ", " BPRI_MED ", " BPRI_HI " or " BPRI_WAITOK ,
the request will be treated as
.BR BPRI_LO .
.PP
The
.I priority
argument is ignored by
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4spg
.]
and later implementations.
.PP
The data buffer of length
.I size
and with the necessary physical memory type has already been allocated by the
caller and is pointed to by the argument
.IR base .
In addition,
.BR esballoc ()
accepts a pointer to a
.B free_rtn
structure that contains the following elements:
.TP
.BI "void (*" free_func ")(char *)"
A function pointer
.I free_func
to a function returning void and taking a single character
pointer argument.  This function should perform whatever actions are necessary
to free the buffer pointed to by
.I base
in the call to
.BR esballoc ().
.TP
.BI "char *" free_arg
A character pointer argument
.I free_arg
that will be passed to a call to
.I free_func
when the message block returned by
.BR esballoc ()
is freed with
.BR freeb "(9) or " freemsg (9).
.PP
The allocated message block will have a data block type of
.BR M_DATA (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Priority
.B BPRI_WAITOK
is added for
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
.[
osfspg
.]
compatibility and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.PP
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not rely on any setting of priority and should
assume that the implementation ignores the
.I priority
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR esballoc ()
returns a pointer to the allocated message block.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR esballoc ()
returns a
.B NULL
message pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR esballoc ()
fails to allocate a message or data block,
it returns
.BR NULL .
Failure to allocate a message block will typically be followed by a call to
.BR esbbcall (9).
.PP
.BR esballoc ()
will always fail to allocate a message block when the number of outstanding
combined message data blocks allocated by the system exceeds the system
control
.BR sysctl_str_nstrmsgs .
.BR esballoc ()
will also fail if
.I size
is greater than system control
.BR sysctl_str_strmsgsz ,
the maximum
.I STREAMS
message size.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR esballoc ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
The priority
.B BPRI_WAITOK
must only be used from a blocking context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR esballoc ()
is MP-safe.  The caller has exclusive access to the returned message.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Many
.RI post- "SVR 4.2"
.[
svr42
.]
compliant
.I STREAMS
implementations ignore the
.I priority
argument to
.BR esballoc ().
The message block
.I priority
was an
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
concept which was found not to be useful, primarily due to priority inversion.
For a history of the
.I priority
mechanism and a discussion as to why the mechanism was abandoned in
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
see \*(lqThe Magic Garden\*(rq section 7.2.2.
.[
magic
%P Section 7.2.2
.]
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
keeps two stores for combined message data blocks
.RB ( mdbblock s):
a per-CPU free block list that is maintained during the 
.BR runqueues (9)
pass to hold freed message blocks (but freed to the memory cache at the end of
the pass), and an
.B mdbblock
memory cache.
.PP
In consideration of
.IR priority ,
.BR esballoc ()
uses the following allocation differences based on the value of
.IR priority :
.TP \w'\ BPRI_WAITOK\ 'u
.B BPRI_LO
The message block will be allocated from the
.I STREAMS
.B mdbblock
memory cache.
.BR kmem_cache_alloc (9)
will not be permitted to grow the
.B mdbblock
memory cache to meet the request.
When speed is not critical and a lower degree of immediate success is acceptable, use
.BR BPRI_LO .
.TP
.B BPRI_MED
The message block will be allocated from the
.I STREAMS
.B mdbblock
memory cache.
.BR kmem_cache_alloc (9)
will be permitted to grow the
.B mdbblock
memory cache as necessary to allocate the block.
Where speed is not so critical, but a higher probability of immediate success is needed, use
.BR BPRI_MED .
.TP
.B BPRI_HI
The message block will be allocated from the per-CPU
.B STREAMS
scheduler fast free chain, or if there is no message block in the fast free
chain, it will be allocated from the
.B mdbblock
memory cache.
.BR kmem_cache_alloc (9)
will be permitted to grow the
.B mdbblock
memory cache as necessary to allocate the block.
Where speed is critical, and a high degree of immediate success is also needed, use
.BR BPRI_HI .
When
.BR esballoc (9)
is called immediately following
.BR freeb (9),
use
.B BPRI_HI
to obtain the same block that was freed.
.TP
.B BPRI_WAITOK
The buffer allocation will be treated as
.BR BPRI_LO ,
but the caller will block waiting to obtain a buffer.
.PP
In this way, the
.I priority
argument determines the delay in satisfying the request rather than the
ultimate probability of success, permitting low latency tasks to specify
.B BPRI_HI
and high-latency tasks to specify
.BR BPRI_LO .
.PP
.BR esballoc ()
presents challenges when used from within
.B Linux
kernel modules.  Particularly when the
.I free_func
function pointer references a function which is resident only within the
kernel module.
Care must be taken that the kernel module containing the
.I free_func
does not get unloaded from the system before all message blocks referencing
.I free_func
are freed.
.PP
Under Linux 2.4 kernels, and kernels that do not provide the
.BR module_text_address ()
symbol, module reference counting is the caller's responsibility and
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
provides no automatic facility for this purpose.  If a kernel module contains
the
.I free_func
that is passed to
.BR esballoc (),
the caller should increment the kernel module use count with
.B MOD_INC_USE_COUNT
prior to the allocation, and decrement the module use count with
.B MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT
within the function referenced by
.IR free_func .
See
.RI \*(lq EXAMPLES \*(rq
below.
.PP
Under Linux 2.6 kernels, and kernels that provide the
.BR module_text_address ()
symbol,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
will perform the module reference counting automatically.

.SH EXAMPLES

The following examples shows how a data buffer suitable for use by Direct
Memory Access is allocated:

 19      if ((buf = kmalloc(bufsize,
 20                         GFP_ATOMIC | GFP_DMA))) {
 21          mblk_t *mp;
 22          frtn_t freertn = {
 23              free_func:&xxx_free_func,
 24              free_arg:(char *) buf,
 25          };
 26  
 27          if (!(mp = esballoc(buf, bufsize,
 28                              BPRI_MED, &freertn)))
 29              xxx_free_func(buf);
 30          return (mp);
 31      }
 32      MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;
 33      return (NULL);
 34  }
\s+2\fP
.fi
.PP
The example, above, also shows the technique for keeping the current kernel
module from unloading before the free function is called for all outstanding
message blocks that reference the free function.  See
.RI \*(lq NOTICES \*(rq,
above.
.B MOD_INC_USE_COUNT
and
.B MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT
in the example code is only necessary for Linux 2.4 kernels and can be defined
as shown for Linux 2.6 kernels (where reference counting is performed
automatically).
