.SH NAME
.B M_PCTTY
\- \fISTREAMS\fP interrupt message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_PCTTY
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains structured data.
.PP
An
.B M_PCTTY
message is a high priority message that consists of a single
.B M_TRAIL
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation extension.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_PCTTY
message is a high priority message type used for communication between the
.BR ldterm (4)
module and the
Stream head under
.IR AIX \(rg.
.[
aixspg
.]
Used by the
.IR AIX \(rg
Stream head to inform the
.BR ldterm (4)
module when an event, such as
.BR read (2s)
or
.BR ioctl (2s)
has been aborted by user signal (timer or break).  The
.BR ldterm (4)
module must remove message blocks representing aborted read or ioctl from the
queue and free it.  A pointer to the original message block that was aborted
is included in this message.
.PP
Any module or driver that can defer procesing on an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_READ (9)
message (a
.I TCSETAW
input-output control, for example) must be prepared to release that deferred
message when the associated system call is interrupted.  A typical scenario is
as follows:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
An application starts a short duration timer.
.IP 2.
The application issues a "wait for drain" input-output control which takes
some time to complete.
.IP 3.
The timer expires, interrupting the "wait for drain" input-output control.
.IP 4.
The application loops back up to restart the timer and reissue the
input-output control, repeating this loop until most of the system memory is
used by
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
messages.
.PP
To prevent this situation, each time a
.BR read (2s)
or
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call is interrupted, the
.IR AIX \(rg
Stream head sends a
.B M_PCTTY
message downstream with a pointer to the message block associated with the
interrupted system call.
Any module or driver must compare that pointer to any queued message block and
release the message block it it matches.
.PP
The
.B M_PCTTY
message will be formatted as a
.B ttyblk
structure, defined in the
.RB < sys/stream.h >
header file.  The
.I tty_op
field corresponds tot he tyupe of system call interrupted: either
.BR S_IOCTLGONE " or " S_READGONE .
The
.I b_rptr
field of the message block contains the address of the message block to be
released.  Example code is as follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
switch (mp->b_datap->db_type) {
case M_PCTTY:
    tb = (struct ttyblk *) mp->b_rptr;
    switch (tb->tty_op) {
    case S_IOCTLGONE:
        mp->b_rptr += sizeof(struct ttyblk);
        if (tp->t_qioctl == *((mblk_t **) mp->b_rptr)) {
            rmvq(q, tp->t_qioctl);
            freemsg(tp->t_qioctl);
            tp->t_qioctl = NULL;
            freemsg(mp);
            qenable(q);
        } else
            putnext(q, mp);
    }
}
\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
A module that is pushed above the
.BR ldterm (4)
module and processes
.BR M_DATA (9)
messages received from the
.BR ldterm (4)
module should send an
.BR M_READ (9)
message downstream to the
.BR ldterm (4)
module if more data is required.  The
.BR ldterm (4)
module only sends
.BR M_DATA (9)
message upstream when an
.BR M_READ (9)
is outstanding, so the pushed module must simulate the interaction between the
Stream head and the
.BR ldterm (4)
module.  This module should also be prepared to receive an
.B M_PCTTY
message from the Stream head, indicating the termination of an outstanding
read.
.PP
.B M_PCTTY
messages are generated by the Stream head.
.B M_PCTTY
messages cannot be generated directly by a user level process (but indirectly
upon receipt of a signal).
.B M_PCTTY
messages arriving at the Stream head are discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_PCTTY
messages should not be geenrated by drivers or modules.
.B M_PCTTY
messages are consumed by the driver or module responding to them.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
This message is supposedly necessary because an indefinite number of
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_READ (9)
messages could be otherwise queued.  This is hard to support and probably just
reflects a poorly designed
.BR ldterm (4)
module.
Only one (unabandonned)
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message can be outstanding at a time.  The following put procedure code would
do the same function as that above:
.sp
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
switch (mp->b_datap->db_type) {
case M_IOCTL:
    if (tp->t_qioctl != NULL) {
        rmvq(q, tp->t_qioctl);
        freemsg(tp->t_quioctl);
        tp->t_qioctl = mp;
    }
    putq(q, mp);
}
\fP
.fi
.RE
.sp
Although multiple
.BR M_READ (9)
messages can be outstanding, the messages never need
to be queued as they simply contain a count.  (Note also that
.BR M_READ (9)
messages are high priority messages.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B M_PCSETOPTS
message is documented only by
.IR AIX \(rg.
.[
aixspg
.]
It is provided to assist porting of drivers and modules written for
.IR AIX \(rg
to
.BR Linux .
It might be necessary to define
.B _AIX_SOURCE
before including
.RB < sys/stream.h >
to expose this symbol.
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
The following guidelines are for processing of the
.B M_PCTTY
message at drivers and modules:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
If an intermediate module recognizes, but is not deferring
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_READ (9)
messages, it passes it downstream.  As a high priority message,
.B M_PCTTY
messages are not subject to flow control and should not be queued.
.IP \(bu
If an intermediate module does not recognize the
.B M_PCTTY
message, it passes it along the Stream as with any unrecognized high priority
message: it is not subject to flow control and should not be queued.
.IP \(bu
If a driver receives an
.B M_PCTTY
message and does not recognize the message, it is discarded (ignored and
freed).  If the driver is not deferring
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_READ (9)
messages, the message is discarded (ignored and freed).
.IP \(bu
If an intermediate module or the driver recognizes the
.B M_PCTTY
mesage and is deferring
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_READ (9)
messages, it treats the message as an indication that the deferred
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_READ (9)
message belongs to an aborted attempt and consumes the message.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

The

with the following portability considerations:

and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  It might be necessary to define
.B _AIX_SOURCE
before including
.RB < sys/stream.h >
to expost this symbol.
.IP ""
Portable
