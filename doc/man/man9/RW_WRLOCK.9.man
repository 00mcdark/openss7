.SH NAME
.B RW_WRLOCK
\- acquire a read/write lock in write mode
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SVR4_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ksynch.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "pl_t RW_WRLOCK(rwlock_t *" lockp ", pl_t " pl );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I lockp
A pointer to the read/write lock to acquire in write mode.
.TP
.I pl
A priority level to set if required before attempting to acquire the lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC (9),
.BR RW_DEALLOC (9),
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_WRLOCK (),
.BR RW_TRYRDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK (9)
and
.BR RW_UNLOCK (9)
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, read locking,
write locking, read lock attempt, write lock attempt and unlocking a
read/write lock of type
.BR rwlock_t .
.PP
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
sets the priority level specified by the
.I pl
argument using
.BR spl (9)
and then acquires the read/write lock specified by the
.I lockp
argument in write mode.  If the lock cannot be acquired immediately, the
calling processor will spin (or block) waiting for the lock to be released.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
returns the priority level that was prevailing at the time that
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
was called.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
is always successful.  If
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
is called with invalid or uninitialized arguments, the results will be
indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.PP
It is not necessary to raise the priority level using the
.I pl
argument if there is never an attempt to take a read or write lock on
.I lockp
from an interrupt service routine context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Read/write locks of type
.B rwlock_t
are not fully recursive.  Calling
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
for a read/write lock that has been locked for read or write by the calling
processor with
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9)
or
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
will result in single party deadlock.
.PP
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9)
is implemented by calling
.BR spl (9)
with the
.I pl
argument and then taking a write lock on the
.I lockp
using
.BR write_lock (9).
The old interrupt priority level returned from
.BR spl (9)
is returned to the caller.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
