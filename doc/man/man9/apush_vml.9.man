.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR apush_vml ()
verifies the module list in the passed in with the
.BR str_list (5)
structure pointer,
.IR slp .
.PP
.I slp
is a pointer to a
.B str_list
structure as follows:

.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR apush_vml ()
is functionally equivalent to the
.BR SAD_VML
input-output control to the
.BR sad (4)
driver.
The
.BR apush_vml ()
function is a useful way for a driver or module to manipulate the autopush
list associated with a \fISTREAMS\fP driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR apush_vml ()
returns the list of module names and number of names in the
.B str_list
structure.

Upon failure,

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR apush_vml ()
can be called from any blocking context, including user context and queue
.IR qi_qopen (9)
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routines.
.\"can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
.\"interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR apush_vml ()
is MP-safe.
The caller must ensure exclusive access to the passed in
.B str_list
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR apush_vml ()
is an
.IR @PACKAGE@ -specific
function.
.PP
.BR apush_vml ()
is an internal implementation specific function, and will not be used directly by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.PP
Calling
.BR apush_vml ()
has the kernel module side-effect that if a \fISTREAMS\fP driver or module associated
with
.I slp
does not currently exists in the system, an attempt will be made to load the
driver or module associated with the driver or module name in
.I slp
before return.
No attempt, however, is made to load any kernel modules associated with the
autopush modules in the list.
