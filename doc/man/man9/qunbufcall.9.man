.SH NAME
.B qunbufcall
\- cancel a \fISTREAMS\fP buffer callback
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SUN_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/sunddi.h>
.HP
.BI "void qunbufcall(queue_t *" q ", bufcall_id_t " bcid );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue with which the original call to
.BR qbufcall (9)
was associated.
.TP
.I bcid
the non-zero buffer call id returned by the associated
.BR qbufcall (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qunbufcall ()
cancels the buffer callback that was installed using
.BR qbufcall (9).
.I bcid
is the buffer callback identifier that was returned from a previous call to
.BR qbufcall (9)
with the queue
.IR q .
.PP
.BR qunbufcall ()
is typically used to remove outstanding buffer calls when a stream is closing.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qunbufcall ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qunbufcall ()
silently fails if the buffer callback identified by
.I bcid
no longer exists (has executed); or,
.I bcid
is invalid.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qunbufcall ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qunbufcall ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller of
.BR qunbufcall ()
must ensure that the callback function has not returned from running before
calling
.BR qunbufcall ().
.PP
Because the module is permitted to unload after calling
.BR qunbufcall ()
for all outstanding buffer callbacks the call to
.BR qunbufcall ()
will not return until either the callback function has completed, or the
callback function has been cancelled.  Therefore the callback function will be
guaranteed not to run once 
.BR qunbufcall ()
has returned for all outstanding callbacks.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qunbufcall ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this
symbol.
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
can be used to cancel a buffer call made with
.BR qbufcall (9).
.PP
The
.I q
argument to
.BR qunbufcall ()
is ignored.
.PP
Because
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses object indices to
.B strevent
structures that expire once the callback function has run, when
.BR qunbufcall ()
is called, it must be called promptly and should never be called after the callback function has
already completed.  Also, the callback function should remove all global references to
.I bcid
so that stale buffer call handles do not exist in the system.

.PP

.BR unbufcall (9).

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qunbufcall ()
has no known bugs.
