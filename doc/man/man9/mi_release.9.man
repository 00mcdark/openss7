a pointer to the locked queue private structure returned from a call to either

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_acquire (),
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9),
and
.BR mi_release (9)
are a set of per queue pair Stream locking functions that can be used with the
functions from the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family.
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
unlocks the specified locked private structure that was returned from a previous successful call to
.BR mi_acquire "(9) or " mi_acquire_sleep (9).
.PP
If another thread failed a call to
.BR mi_acquire (9)
while the structure was locked,
.BR mi_release ()
will schedule the queue procedure, using
.BR qenable (9),
of the queue whose pointer was passed to the failed
.BR mi_acquire (9)
call.
.PP
If another thread failed a call to
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9)
while the structure was locked,
.BR mi_release ()
will wake the process that was put to sleep by
.RB mi_acquire_sleep (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_acquire "(9), " mi_acquire_sleep "(9) and " mi_release ()
simplify the implementation of private structure locks for fully MP-SAFE
.IR STREAMS (9)
modules and drivers.  The function attempts to unlock the private structure associated with the
pointer argument,
.IR  ptr ,
locked by a previous call to
.BR mi_acquire (9)
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9).
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
is called at the end of put or service procedure execution when the procedure wishes exclusive
access to the private structure (perhaps to alter state variable) and acquires the lock at the
beginning of the procedure.
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
is always successful when passed valid arguments.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
is always successful.  If
.BR mi_release ()
is passed invalid or uninitialized arguments, or a
.IR ptr
argument that has not been locked by the calling context, the result will be indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and
interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
is MP-safe, however, the caller is responsible for ensuring the validity of the passed in pointer
across the call.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
must only be called for a private structure that was allocated with
.BR mi_alloc (9)
or
.BR mi_alloc_sleep (9)
or one of the other private structure allocation functions from the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family of functions.
.PP
Any queue that uses
.BR mi_release ()
should have a queue service procedure.
.PP
Each successful call to
.BR mi_acquire (9)
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9)
must me matched with a corresponding call to
.BR mi_release ()
or processor or process deadlock may occur.
.PP
The lock acquired by
.BR mi_acquire (9)
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9)
on the private structure associated with queue,
.IR q ,
is not a recursive lock.  That is, if
.BR mi_acquire (9)
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9)
are called successively for the same queue,
.IR  q,
and with no intervening call to
.BR mi_release (),
the first call to
.BR mi_acquire (9)
or
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9)
succeeds, and the second call to
.BR mi_acquire (9)
fails and the second call to
.BR mi_acquire_sleep (9)
sleeps indefinitely.
The is adequate for both put, service and open, close routines which are seldomly reentrant.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
is implemented using basic lock and syncrhonization variable functions.  See
.BR UNLOCK (9)
and
.BR SV_BROADCAST (9).

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_release ()
is an OpenSS7 Project specific implementation of an
.IR MPS \(rg-compatible
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_release ()
is provided for use with SS7 drivers and modules that need some automatic locking of queue pair
private structure for speed and efficiency.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_release ()
does not exist in any other
.IR MPS \(rg
implementation other than
.IR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR aixcompat (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
.BR suncompat (9),
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.

.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
Conforms to

documentation.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
.BR mi_release ()
is new for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
It is largely equivalent to the
.BR ss7_unlockq (9)
SS7 common function that appeared in early releases of the
.B strss7
package and is also contained in
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
