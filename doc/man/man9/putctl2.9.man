.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue to which to put the control message.
.PD 0
.TP
.I type
the type of the control message.
.TP
.I param1
a one-byte parameter to place in the first byte of the message.
.TP
.I param2
a one-byte parameter to place in the second byte of the message.
.PD
.\"

.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR putctl2 ()
creates a two-byte control message of type
.I type
with the two-byte data containing the data
.IR param1 " and " param2 ,
and calls
.BR put (9)
for the queue pointed to by
.I q
to place the message on the queue.
If
.I type
is a data message type
.RB ( M_DATA "(9), " M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9))
and not a control message type,
.BR putctl2 ()
will fail.
Note that
.BR putctl2 ()
can succeed for message type
.BR M_DELAY (9),
which is normally a data message type according to
.BR datamsg (9).
.PP
.BR putctl2 ()
allocates the message block for the message with priority
.BR BPRI_HI ,
[see
.BR allocb (9)].
.BR putctl2 ()
fails if message block allocation fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR putctl2 ()
is used by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules, or associated interrupt service routines, to pass simple messages that contain
a two-byte data buffer [e.g.,
.BR M_ERROR (9)]
to a Stream end.
However,
.BR putctl2 ()
is not normally used by the Stream head because it will not block awaiting the availability of a
message block.
For passing messages between queues along a Stream,
.BR putnextctl2 (9)
should be used instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR putctl2 ()
returns
.I true
.RB ( 1 ).
Upon failure,
.BR putctl2 ()
returns
.I false
.RB ( 0 ).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR putctl2 ()
fails and returns
.I false
.RB ( 0 )
if the specified
.I type
is not a control message type, or if the allocation of the necessary message block fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR putctl2 ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines;
however, see the considerations listed under
.BR put (9).
.PP
Because
.BR putctl2 ()
uses
.BR put (9),
it may be called from contexts asynchronous to
.IR STREAMS ,
such as interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR putctl2 ()
is MP-safe when called from any context.  However, the caller is responsible for ensuring the
validity of the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q .
See also the considerations listed under
.BR put (9),
and
.BR mp-streams (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR putctl2 ()
can succeed with a
.I type
argument of
.BR M_DELAY (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Message blocks allocated by
.BR putctl2 ()
are allocated with priority
.BR BPRI_HI ,
and placed on the Stream with
.BR put (9).
