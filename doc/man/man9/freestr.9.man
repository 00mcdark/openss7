.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void freestr(struct stdata *" sth ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I sth
a pointer to the stream head to deallocate.

.SH INTERFACE

.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR freestr ()
deallocates an internal 
.I STREAMS
stream head.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR freestr ()
is used to deallocate a stream head that was allocated with
.BR allocstr (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR freestr ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR freestr ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR freestr ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, call outs, callbacks,
soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR freestr ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller must ensure exclusive access to the passed in stream head,
.IR sth .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR freestr ()
is an internal function, and is not recommended for usage by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.BR freestr ()
is only made available for use by specialized modules distributed with this
.I STREAMS
package (such as
.BR connld (4)),
and for compatibility with
.I SVR 3
systems predating the
.IR "SVR 4 DDI/DKI" .
Unlike
.BR freeq (9),
(which makes some sense for private queue pairs),
.BR freestr ()
poses no useful portable purpose.
.BR freestr ()
will not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR freestr ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,

and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4"
.[

.BR freestr ()
should not be called by normal
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules and is implementation specific.
.IP \(em
This function is not exported by
.I "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
or any other UNIX directly.  It is declared in some earlier
.I SVR 3
.I <sys/stream.h>
header files.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
