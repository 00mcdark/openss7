.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_allocb ()
is a reliable buffer allocation function that can be used with the functions from the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family.
.PP
In contrast to the DDI/DKI function,
.BR allocb (9),
.BR mi_allocb ()
takes an extra argument,
.IR q ,
a pointer to the queue to schedule (with
.BR qenable (9))
when a buffer of size,
.IR size ,
and priority,
.IR priority ,
becomes available.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_allocb ()
is used to simplify and make more efficient the handling of buffer callbacks when allocating message
blocks within a
.I STREAMS
module or driver.
.BR mi_allocb ()
can be used throughout the driver or module from the
.I STREAMS
synchronous environment, whenever a message block would otherwise be allocated using
.BR allocb (9).
.BR mi_allocb ()
is called instead, and passed the queue,
.IR q ,
for which an active message is being processed by a put or service procedure.
.PP
When
.BR mi_allocb ()
fails to allocate a message block, it returns
.B NULL
and schedules a buffer callback that will enable queue,
.IR q ,
when a buffer becomes available.
The caller can then simply place the message being processed on its receiving queue,
.IR q ,
and return.  The queue,
.IR q ,
service procedure will be invoked when a buffer is available and the message taken off of the queue
for processing once again.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When the buffer allocation is successful,
.BR mi_allocb ()
functions identical to
.BR allocb (9),
and returns a pointer to the newly allocated buffer.
When the buffer allocation fails,
.BR mi_allocb ()
returns
.B NULL
and generates a buffer callback for the queue,
.IR q .
When the buffer callback is executed, the queue,
.IR q ,
is enabled using
.BR qenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_allocb (9)
always succeeds; however, whether a buffer was immediately allocated depends on the return value.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Following is an example of the use of
.BR mi_allocb ().
In the example, a zero-length
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is appended to all
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks received on a Stream.

.PP
In the example, when a buffer cannot be immediately allocated with
.BR mi_allocb (),
the caller simply places the message to be processed on the queue,
.IR q ,
and returns.  The queue,
.IR q ,
will have its service procedure scheduled, using
.BR qenable (9),
when a buffer is available and processing of the message can continue.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_allocb ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and
interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_allocb ()
is MP-safe, however, see
.BR allocb (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_allocb ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ", " _AIX_SOURCE ", " _MAC_SOURCE " or _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ", " CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ", "
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ", " CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE ", "
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC ", " CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE ", "
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN " or " CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.
.PP
Because
.BR mi_allocb ()
stores a buffer callback identifier in the module private structure for queue,
.IR q ,
.BR mi_allocb ()
cannot be called for a queue pair that has not had its private structure allocated with one of the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family of functions.
.PP
Because
.BR mi_allocb ()
utilizes
.BR allocb (9)
and
.BR bufcall (9),
many of the caveats that apply to those functions also apply to
.BR mi_allocb ().
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.BR mi_allocb ()
function is implemented with a rather direct call to
.BR allocb (9)
and a call to
.BR bufcall (9)
with the queue pointer,
.IR q ,
upon failure of the call to
.BR allocb (9)
to immediately allocate a buffer.
Because the buffer callback must be cancelled before returning from the
.I STREAMS
close procedure, the buffer callback identifier is saved in the module
private structure.  Because this is automatic,
.BR mi_allocb ()
can only be called on Streams that have their private data structures allocated with one of the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
family of functions.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
.BR mi_allocb ()
is new for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
It is largely equivalent to the
.BR ss7_allocb (9)
SS7 common function that appeared in early releases of the
.B strss7
package and is also contained in
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.PP
.BR mi_allocb ()
first appeared in
.I OpenSS7
release 1.1.1 as a result of an effort to remove the remaining undocumented
SS7 helper functions.  Because
.BR mi_allocb ()
relies on the set of
.B mi_*
helper functions being used to allocate private structures, the function was
transposed into the
.B mi_*
group of helper functions.
