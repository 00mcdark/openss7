.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B qprocsoff
\- disables \fISTREAMS\fR message queue processing for multi-processing
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "void qprocsoff(queue_t *" qp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I qp
the read queue pointer of the queue pair for which to turn queue procedures
off.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
disables invocation of
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures for the queue pair whose read queue pointer is pointed to by
.IR qp .
.PP
If there are existing threads other than the calling thread executing
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures for either queue in the the queue pair,
.IR qp ,
then
.BR qprocsoff ()
will block until these threads exit before returning.
Once
.BR qprocsoff ()
returns, it is guaranteed that a
.I STREAMS
driver or module queue pair is single threaded after
.BR qprocsoff ()
returns and before
.BR qprocson (9)
is called.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
can be called from any
context including user context, queue procedures, call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets
and bottom halves), and
interrupt service routines; however, it is only intended to be called by a module
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure.
.BR qprocsoff ()
must be called by the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure (i.e. in user context) before returning.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
is MP-safe.
Upon return from
.BR qprocsoff ()
the the queue pair is guaranteed to be single threaded.
.BR qprocsoff ()
should not be called twice for the same queue pair from the same thread.
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
must be called before removing or invalidating module private state information attached to the
.I q_ptr
for either queue in the queue pair as part of the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure for the driver or module, regardless of whether the underlying architecture is UP or MP.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
must be called with a valid read queue pointer for a queue pair.
.BR qprocsoff ()
must not be called on a stream that is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9),
or single-party deadlock will result.
.PP
Before a call to
.BR qprocsoff ()
a driver or module is fully attached on a stream.
.BR qprocsoff ()
bypasses the module so that any upstream or downstream module calling
.BR putnext (9)
will bypass the module.
Pending
.IR qi_putp (9)
events on the queue pair will be run before
.BR qprocsoff ()
returns.
Pending
.IR qi_srvp (9)
events will be cancelled.
All pending synchronous call-out and callback events for the queue pair will be
blocked.
All pending asynchronous call-outs and callbacks for the
queue pair (e.g.,
.BR timeout (9),
.BR bufcall (9))
will not be blocked.
It is still the caller's responsibility to cancel all pending call-outs and
callbacks for which a call id was returned.
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
can be called twice on the same queue pair without consequence.
.PP
After a call to
.BR qprocsoff ()
the caller must not directly or indirectly invoke any queue entry points.  This includes
all queue utility functions and other
.I STREAMS
utility functions that take
.I qp
or
.BI WR( qp )
as an argument.

has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qprocson ()
can be called with private queue pairs allocated with
.BR allocq (9).
This is a non-portable
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
extension.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not allocate private queue pairs.
.IP \(em
.BR qprocsoff ()
sets the
.I QPROCS
flag in the
.BR queue (9)
structure for both queues in the queue pair.
.BR qprocsoff ()
can be called repeatedly for the same queue pair and only the first call will
have an effect.  This can crash or lock processors on other systems (with the
exception of
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
as noted below.)
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not call
.BR qprocsoff ()
repeatedly for the same queue without first calling
.BR qprocson (9).
.IP \(em
.BR qprocsoff ()
waits for all other threads to exit
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures before returning.  This is consistent with
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
and documentation for
.IR Solaris \(rg.
.[
usldk
.]
.[
soldoc
.]
.IP \(em
The driver or module can neglect to call
.BR qprocsoff ()
before returning from the module's
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure and the
.I STREAMS
scheduler will perform an implicit
.BR qprocsoff ().
This is different from
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg.
Because
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
and 
.IR Solaris \(rg
should never return from
.IR qi_qclose (9)
without calling
.BR qprocsoff (),
there should be no compatibility issues.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will call
.BR qprocsoff ()
before returning from the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure (invoked on the last close of a stream).
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg
.IR OSF/1 \(rg

.BR qprocsoff ()
function.

procedure.
.IP \(em
.BR qprocsoff ()
