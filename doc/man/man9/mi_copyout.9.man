.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is one of a set of helper functions that supports both
.B TRANSPARENT
and
.IR I_STR (7)
input-output controls (see
.BR ioctl (2s)
and
.BR streamio (7)).
These helper functions include:
.BR mi_copyin (9),
.BR mi_copyout (9),
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9),
.BR mi_copy_done (9),
.BR MI_COPY_CASE (9),
.BR mi_copy_set_rval (9)
and
.BR mi_copy_state (9).
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is used to copy data from the kernel to user-space.  When a driver or module
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure receives a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message, and there is data to be copied out to user-space, the
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9)
function is used to add data to the message pointed to by
.I mp
and then the
.BR mi_copyout ()
function is called to invoke the
.BR M_COPYOUT (9)
message upstream.
.PP
If called after the last copy in or copy out operation and no copy out allocations were generated
with
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9)
or remain after previous
.BR mi_copyout ()
calls, then
.BR mi_copyout ()
will close the input output control operation as though
.BR mi_copy_done (9)
was called like:
\fBmi_copy_done\fR(\fIq\fR, \fImp\fR, \fIcp->cp_rval\fR).
.PP
When
.BR mi_copyout ()
is called for a non-transparent
.IR I_STR (7)
operation, the input-output control operation is completed and an
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
message issued upstream.  If a copyout operation was previously specified with
a call to
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9),
an implicit copyout operation is included by setting the
.I ioc_count
member of the
.BR iocblk (9)
structure to the size of the copyout operation.
.PP
If it is desired that the return value returned on an
.IR I_STR (7)
operation be other than zero, the
.BR mi_copy_set_rval (9)
utility can be used to set the return value before
.BR mi_copyout (9)
is called.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is used in conjunction with
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9)
to copy data out to the user in the last stage of an input-output control
operation.
.I mp
can either represent a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
.BR I_STR (7)-based
input-output control, or a
.B TRANSPARENT
input-output control that did not require any data to be copied in,
or an
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message from a previous copyin or copyout operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
fails when passed invalid pointers.  When
.BR mi_copyout ()
fails, it panics the kernel.
.PP
If
.BR mi_copyout ()
suffers an internal failure, it will close the input-output control operation with a suitable error
code.  The error codes returned by
.BR mi_copyout ()
to the
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation in
.BR errno (3),
are as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBENOBUFS\fR]\ \ 'u
.RB [ EPROTO ]
.BR mi_copyout ()
was passed an invalid argument, or the passed in message block was of an invalid format.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
.BR mi_copyout (),
or the stream head, could not allocate a
.I STREAMS
resource
to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
.BR mi_copyout (),
or the stream head, could not allocate 
memory to
complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
.BR mi_copyout (),
or the stream head, could not allocate 
a buffer
to complete the operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
See
.BR mi_copyin (9)
and
.BR mi_copyout (9)
for examples of the usage of
.BR mi_copyout ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
can be called from any context; however, it is normally called from the
.I STREAMS
driver or module write-side queue
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is MP-safe; however, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure exclusive access to the passed
in message blocks.  This is normally the case when the function is called from the
.I STREAMS
driver or module write-side queue
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _AIX_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
If
.B mi_copyout ()
is called incorrectly, it will abort the input-output control operation and
send an
.BR M_IOCNAK (9)
message in response with error number
.RB [ EPROTO ].
Otherwise, an
.BR M_COPYOUT (9)
message is formulated and sent upstream.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_copyout ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common message utility functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copyout ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copyout ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_copyout ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR mpscompat (9),
