.SH NAME
.B linkb
\- link a message block to a \fISTREAMS\fP message
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void linkb(struct msgb *" mp1 ", struct msgb *" mp2 ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I mp1
the message onto which to link.
.PD 0
.TP
.I mp2
the message to link.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR linkb ()
links the message pointed to by
.I mp2
onto the end of the message pointed to by
.IR mp1 .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR linkb ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR linkb ()
silently fails if either
.IR mp1 " or " mp2
are
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR linkb ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR linkb ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible to ensure exclusive access to the passed in messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR linkb ()
could panic the kernel if passed an
invalid pointer.
.BR linkb ()
is robust to being passed
.B NULL
pointers, and
.BI linkb(NULL, mp2 )
.BI linkb( mp1 ,NULL)
and
.BI linkb(NULL,NULL)
are all valid (but the first form results in a memory leak of buffer
.IR mp2 ).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not pass
.BR linkb ()
a
.B NULL
or invalid pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR linkb ()
is implemented as an
.B extern inline
function for speed.  Its imlementation is as follows:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
__EXTERN_INLINE void linkb(mblk_t *mp1, mblk_t *mp2)
{
    mblk_t **mpp;
    for (mpp = &mp1; *mpp; mpp = &(*mpp)->b_cont) ;
    *mpp = mp2;
}

.SH BUGS
.PP

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR linkb ()
is compatible with
