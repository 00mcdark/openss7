.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I map
a pointer to a
.B struct map
structure that was previously initialized by a call to
.BR rminit (9).
.TP
.I size
the number of units to allocate.
.TP
.I addr
the address at which to allocate the space.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR rmget ()
allocates
.I size
units from the given resource map,
.IR map ,
at the address
.IR addr .
In a map, the addresses are increasing, and the list is terminated by a zero
size.  The actual units managed by the map are arbitrary and can be map
registers, bytes, blocks, and so forth.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR rmget ()
suceeds, it returns the base of the allocated space; when it fails, it returns
zero (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When 
.BR rmget ()
fails it returns zero (0).
.BR rmget ()
fails when it cannot immediately allocate the requested resource.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR rmget ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR rmget ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to
the passed in map structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR rmget ()
is an
.IR OSF/1 \(rg-specific
function.
.B _OSF_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI header files to expose this symbol.
Also,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must have been compiled with configuration flag
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_OSF
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_OSF_MODULE
defined.
.PP
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules do not call this function.  Use
.BR rmalloc (9)
instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR rmalloc (9),
.BR rmalloc_wait (9),
.BR rmfree (9),
.BR rminit (9),
.BR rmallocmap (9),
.BR rmallocmap_wait (9),
.BR rmfreemap (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Although
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
specifies a function prototype for
.BR rmget ()
returning
.BR int ,
the returned value is an address.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR rmget ()
are source-level compatible with
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR rmget ()
is a
.IR OSF/1 \(rg-specific
function that should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Use
.BR rmalloc (9)
instead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
