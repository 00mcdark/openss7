.RB { MP_C_CMIS_SERVICE_ERROR },
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_SERVICE_REJECT },
or the constant
.RB ( MP_ABSENT_OBJECT )
which denotes the absense of result.
.sp
An instance of OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_CREATE_RESULT }
specifies the successful completion of the operation.  The result may be absent but it shall be
present if the name of the new managed object instance was not supplied by the invoker of the
creation.
.sp
An instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_SERVICE_ERROR }
including the problem cause and its associated parameter may be returned:
.RB [ MP_E_ACCESS_DENIED ],
