.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function sets or resets the value of the environment attribute,
.IR attr ,
for the service provider identified by the file descriptor,
.IR fd .
Valid attribute names are listed in
.BR ap_env (3).
.PP
The
.I val
argument is a union that is used to pass the value that is to be assigned to the specified
attribute.  The
.I val
union is defined as:
.sp
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef union {
    long l;
    void *v;
} ap_val_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In all cases,
.I val
must be of the same type as the attribute to be modified.
.PP
For example, if the value of the attribute that is to modified is an integer or bit mask, the
.I l
member of the
.B ap_val_t
union must contain a
.B long
or
.BR "unsigned long" .
Otherise, the
.I v
member of the
.B ap_val_t
union must contain a pointer to a structure of the same type as the specified attribute.
.PP
Refer to
.BR ap_env (3)
for a detailed description of the attribute types.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero (0) is returned; otherwise, minus one (-1) is returned
and
.BR ap_errno (3)
is set to indicate the error.  The corresponding error message is returned by calling the
.BR ap_error (3)
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.TP
.RB [ AP_BADATTRVAL ]
\- bad value for environment attribute.
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOATTR ]
