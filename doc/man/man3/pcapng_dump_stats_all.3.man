.TH PCAPNG_DUMP_STATS_ALL 3 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "PCAP-NG Library Calls"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
\- dump interface statistics to a PCAP-NG \(lqsavefile\(rq from \(lqcapture\(rq
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <pcapng.h>
.ad l
.HP 8
.BI "int pcapng_dump_stats_all(pcapng_dumper_t *" d ", pcapng_t *" p ", int *" iidp );
.ad b
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I d
the PCAP-NG \(lqsavefile\(rq handle to which to dump interface statistics.
.TP
.I p
the PCAP-NG \(lqcapture\(rq handle from which to obtain interface statistics.
.TP
.I iidp
the number of interfaces for which statistics were dumped.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
dumps interface statistics to the PCAP-NG \(lqsavefile\(rq specified by the
handle,
.IR d ,
from the PCAP-NG \(lqcapture\(rq specified by the handle,
.IR p .
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
dumps interface statistics for the number of interfaces returned in
.IR *iidp .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR pcapng_dump_stats_all
is a convenience function (it could easily be implemented with calls to
.BR pcapng_stats "(3), " pcapng_list_stats "(3) and " pcapng_dump_stats (3))
that is typically used to dump interface statistics to a PCAP-NG format file
from capture just before closing the \(lqsavefile\(rq, or at intermediate
points within the file.
.PP
The call is equivalent to:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s+1
pcapng_dump_stats(\fId\fR,pcapng_list_stats(\fIp\fR));
\s-1\fR
.fi
.PP
with additional error checking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.BR pcapng_dump_stats_all
is fully thread-safe.  What are described as global variables
are in fact thread-specific data when linked with
.BR libpthread .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
writes the interface statistics to the PCAP-NG dump file and returns zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
also returns the number of interfaces for which interface statistics were
dumped in the argument
.IR *iidp .
Upon failure,
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
return minus one
.RB ( -1 ),
sets an appropriate error number in
.BR p_errno (3)
and sets an appropriate error string in
.BR p_errbuf (3)
when available.
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
also returns the number of interfaces for which interface statistics were
dumped successfully in the argument
.IR *iidp .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR pcapng_dump_stats_all
fails, it returns minus one
.RB ( -1 ),
sets
.IR p_errbuf (3)
to an appropriate error string when available, and sets
.IR p_errno "(3) and " errno (3)
to appropriate error codes as follows:
.PP
.TP
.RB [ PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE "], [" ENODEV ]
The interface,
.IR *iidp ,
did not exist at the time of the call.
.TP
.RB [ PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED "], [" ENXIO ]
The interface,
.IR *iidp ,
was not activated at the time of the call.
.TP
.RB [ PCAP_ERROR ]
An unspecified error occurred while writing to the dump file:
.IR errno "(3) and " p_errbuf (3)
may provide additional information.
The interface identifier,
.IR *iidp ,
caused the error.

.BR pcapng_stats (3),
.BR pcapng_dump_stats (3),
.BR pcap_stats (3pcap),

.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR pcapng_dump_stats_all
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
There is no equivalent to
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
in
.BR libpcap .
PCAP does not have the ability to save interface statistics to the PCAP
formatted \(lqsavefile\(rq.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
conforms to the PCAP-NG 1.0 file format specification.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
.B pcapng_dump_stats_all
first appeared in PCAP-NG 1.0.
.BR pcap_stats (3pcap)
appeared in
.BR libpcap .
