.HP
.BI "DS_status ds_list(OM_private object " session ", OM_private_object " context ", OM_object " name ", OM_private_object *" result_return ", OM_sint *" invoke_id_return );

.SH INTERFACE

.]
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to obtain a list of the immediate subordinates of the
named entry.  The list may be incomplete in some circumstances.
.PP
The result of this operation can be abandonned.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.IR session "\0\fBSession\fP(Object(Session)).
The directory session agains which this operation is performed.  This must be a
private object.
.TP
.IR context "\0\fBContext\fP(Object(Context)).
The directory context to be used for this operation.  This argument must be
a private object or the constant
.RB { DS_DEFAULT_CONTEXT }.
.TP
.IR name "\0\fBName\fP(Object(Name)).
The name of the object entry whose immediate subordinates are to be listed.
Any aliases in the name will be dereferenced unless prohibited by the relevant
service control.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.BR Status "(Status)
Takes the value
.B success
if the named object was located (even if there are no subordinates) and takes
an error value if not, when the subroutine is used synchronously.  Reports
whether the operation was initiated, if used asynchronously.
.TP
.BR Result "(Object(List-Result))
Upon successful completion of a synchronous call, the result contains some
information about the target object's immediate subordinates.  It also contains
the distinguished name of the target object, if an alias was dereferenced to
find it.  Aliases in the subordinate names are not dereferenced.  Also, there
may be a partial outcome qualifier, which indicates that the result is
incomplete.  It also explains why (for example, because the time limit expired)
and contains information that may be helpful when attempting to complete it.
.TP
.BR Invoke-ID "(Integer)
The
.B Invoke-ID
of an asynchronous directory operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
This function can return a System-Error or one of the following Library-Errors:
bad-argument, bad-class, bad-context, bad-name, bad-session, bad-workspace,
miscellaneous, missing-type, too-many-operations.
.PP
The following Directory-Errors may be returned by the function (or by
.BR ds_receive_result (3)
when used asyncrhonously):
Name-Error, Referral, Security-Error, Service-Error.
.PP
This function can return a Communications-Error.
.PP
This function can return the error constant
.RB [ DS_NO_WORKSPACE ].
