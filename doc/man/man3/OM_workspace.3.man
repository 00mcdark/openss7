.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Two application-specific APIs may involve the same class, the two APIs may
employ different implementations of the service, for example, because they are
supplied by different vendors, and the two implementations may represent
private objects differently. If it is to use both application-specific APIs,
the client must be able to specify which service implementation is to create
an instance of the class that both support. In addition, the client may wish
to present the object at both application-specific APIs, in which case the
object must be converted from one internal format to another. Such
interworking between service implementations is achieved by means of
workspaces.
.PP
The service maintains private objects in workspaces. A workspace is a
repository for instances of classes in the closures of one or more packages
associated with the workspace. The implementations of the OM interface
functions may differ from one workspace to another. A package may be
associated with any number of workspaces. The OM package is implicitly
associated with every workspace. Other packages may be explicitly associated
with a workspace when it is defined.
.PP
The interface includes functions for effectively copying and moving objects
from one workspace to another, provided that the objects classes are
associated with both. How workspaces are created, made known to the client and
destroyed, however, is outside the scope of this document. In all cases,
destroying a workspace effectively applies the Delete function to each private
object it contains.
Notes:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
Typically workspaces are created, made known to the client, and destroyed by
means of application-specific APIs designed to be used in conjunction with the
present interface.
.IP 2.
Failure to delete private objects before closing the workspace could result in
consumption of resources by those objects with no mechanism available for
freeing those resources.
