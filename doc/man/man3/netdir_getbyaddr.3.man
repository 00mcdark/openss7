.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.PP
.IR UNIX \(rg
has traditionally provided three components of the Network Services Library,
.BR libnsl ,
that are associated with Transport Provider Interface,
.BR tpi (7),
.IR STREAMS (9)
network pseudo-device drivers, and that are not currently part of the
.B Linux
Network Services Library.  These components are:
.IP 1. \w'1.\(em'u
Network Configuration database access, see
.BR netconfig (3).
.PD 0
.IP 2.
Network Configuration database Path access, see
.BR netpath (3).
.IP 3.
Network Directory Name and Address Service, see
.BR netdir (3).
.PD
.PP
These are often refered to as the Network Selection facility of the Network
Services Library.
.PP
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ()
provides a reverse directory name service for the network transport protocol specified with a
pointer to a
.BR netconfig (5s)
structure,
.IR config .
The
.I config
pointer is acquired using the
.BR getnetconfig (3),
.BR getnetconfigent (3)
or
.BR getnetpath (3)
subroutines and describes a particular transport protocol from the
.BR netconfig (5s)
network configuration database.
The address to reverse lookup is specified as a pointer to a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure,
.IR addr ,
that contains the transport address.
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ()
returns into the pointer referenced by
.I services
a pointer to a
.B nd_hostservlist
structure that contains the host and service name tuples associated with the address,
.IR addr .
.PP
Once the
.B nd_hostservlist
structure and the
.B nd_hostserv
structures that it contains are no longer required, they are freed by passing a pointer to the
structure to
.BR netdir_free (3)
with a
.I struct_type
argument of
.BR ND_HOSTSERVLIST .

.SH USAGE
.PP
Procedure for usage of the
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ()
subroutine is to first acquire a pointer to a
.BR netconfig (3)
structure representing an entry in the
.BR netconfig (5s)
database using a function such as
.BR getnetconfig (3),
.BR getnetconfigent (3)
or
.BR getnetpath (3).
Then an address string is placed in a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure and passed to the
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ()
function.  The returned
.B nd_hostservlist
structure pointer contains the host and service name tuples associated with the address.
Once the
.B nd_hostservlist
structure is no longer required, it is freed with
.BR netdir_free (3)
with a
.I struct_type
argument of
.BR ND_HOSTSERVLIST .
.PP
For Internet Protocol transports,
(that is, when
.I config
points to a
.BR netconfig (5s)
structure corresponding to an Internet Protocol Version 4 or Version 6 network),
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ()
is roughly equivalent to
.BR gethostbyaddr (3)
or
.BR getipnodebyaddr (3);
however,
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ()
is more general and applies to networks other than
.I inet
or
.I inet6
networks.
Also,
.BR gethostbyaddr (3)
and
.BR getipnodebyaddr (3)
do not return the service name.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 )
and places a pointer to an allocated
.B nd_hostservlist
structure in the pointer referenced by the
.I services
argument.
Otherwise, minus one
.RB ( -1 )
is returned and
.BR _nderror (3)
is set to indicate the error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ()
fails, it returns minus one
.RB ( -1 )

.BR netdir_perror (3)

must be called immediately after the failed network configuration subroutine fails.  Otherwise, the
error condition in

argument of
.BR ND_HOSTSERVLIST .
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Name to address lookup libraries that will be have their
.B _netdir_getbyaddr ()
dynamic symbols called to perform the lookup will be searched in the order that they appear in the
.I nc_lookups
member of the specified
.BR netconfig (5s)
structure,
.IR config .
If
.I config
specifies an
.I inet
or
.I inet6
network, and the number of lookup libraries,
.IR nc_nlookups ,
is zero, the standard BSD inet lookup functions will be used.
.PP
.BR _netdir_getbyaddr ()
is the symbol provided by shared object lookup libraries to implement
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ().
If the library does not implement
.BR _netdir_getbyaddr (),
.BR netdir_getbyaddr ()
will fail, return minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and set

to
