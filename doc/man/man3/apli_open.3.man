.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function creates a new instance of APLI that uses the service provider specified by
.IR pathname .
In the case of the SunLink implementation of APLI,
.I pathname
must identify the device
.BR /dev/oopi
that corresponds to the SunLink OSI Communication Platform.  Note that
.I pathname
may be the actual device name
.BR /dev/oopi ,
or a symbolic link that points to this device.
.PP
The SunLink implementation of APLI will not access a NULL value for
.IR pathname .
.PP
The
.I oflags
argument is a bit mase set to
.B O_NDELAY
to request non-blocking execution mode (no delay).  Unless specified otherwise, the API instance
operates in blocking mode.
.PP
The APLI environment must be initialized using a call to the
.BR ap_init_env (3)
function before the APLI instance can be used to send or receive primitives.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
On successful completion,
.BR ap_open ()
returns the integer value file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
that is used to identify the service provider in all subsequent function calls.  Otherwise, a value
of minus one
.RB ( -1 )
is returned an
.BR ap_errno (3)
is set to indicate the error.
The corresponding error message is returned by calling the
.BR ap_error (3)
function.

.SH ERRORS

In addition, operating system class errors are reported.

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
The following code fragment shows how
.BR ap_open ()
can be used to open an APLI isntance that will operate in blocking mode (default) by setting
.I oflags
to NULL or zero.  To operate in non-blocking mode,
.I oflags
must be set to
.B O_NDLEAY
(no delay).

.B /dev/oopi
as well as any device that acts as an ASCE/Presentaiton provider.
