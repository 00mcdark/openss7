.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function performs any necessary initialization of the interface and
allocates a workspace.  It must be called before any other directory interface
functions are called.  It may be called multiple times, in which case each call
returns a workspace that is distinct from other workspaces created by
.BR ds_initialize ()
but not yet deleted by
.BR ds_shutdown (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
None.

.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.BR Workspace "(Workspace)
Upon successful completion, contains a handle to a workspace in which OM
objects can be created and manipulated.  Objects created in this workspace, and
only such objects, may be used as arguments to the other directory interface
functions.  This function returns
.B NULL
if it fails.
