.HP
.BI "int endnetpath(void *" handle );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP \w'handle\(em'u
.I handle
an opaque pointer returned by

to be used as an argument to calls to

and
.BR endnetpath ().
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.IR UNIX \(rg
has traditionally provided three components of the Network Services Library,
.BR libnsl ,
that are associated with Transport Provider Interface,
.BR tpi (7),
.IR STREAMS (9)
network pseudo-device drivers, and that are not currently part of the
.B Linux
Network Services Library.  These components are:
.IP 1. \w'1.\(em'u
Network Configuration database access, see
.BR netconfig (3).
.PD 0
.IP 2.
Network Path access, see
.BR netpath (3).
.IP 3.
Name-to-Address Translation, see
.BR netdir (3).
.PD
.PP
The first two are often refered to as the Network Selection facility of the
Network Services Library.
.PP
The
.BR netpath (3)
component (of which
.BR endnepath ()
is a member)
provides a mechanism to sequentialy access entries in the Network Configuration database that
correspond to entries in the
.RB { NETPATH }
environment variable.  That is, the
.RB { NETPATH }
environment variable acts as a filter specification that filters network identifiers.
Members of this component are:
.BR setnetpath "(3), " getnetpath "(3) and " endnetpath ().
.PP
.BR endnetpath ()
releases client access to the database and frees for reuse any resources that were held by
.BR setnetpath (3)
for use by
.BR getnetpath (3).
.BR endnetpath ()
must only be called with a
.I handle
returned from a previous and corresponding call to
.BR setnetpath (3).
.BR endnetpath ()
must be called for each call to
.BR setnetpath (3)
with the corresponding
.I handle
pointer as the argument.
.PP
.BR nc_perror (3)
and
.BR nc_sperror (3)
provide a mechanism for providing diagnostic messages upon failure.  These subroutines are used for
both
.BR netconfig (3)
subroutines as well as the
.B netpath
subroutines described here.
.\"
.\"
.SS "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The format of the
.B /etc/netconfig
Network Configuration database file is as described in
.BR netconfig (5s).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR nc_perror (3)
and
.BR nc_sperror (3)
must be called immediately after the failed network configuration subroutine
fails.  Otherwise, the error condition may be lost.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR endnetpath ()
returns 0.  Otherwise, -1 is
returned and
.IR nc_error (3)
is set to indicate the error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR endnetpath ()
fails, it returns minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.BR nc_error (3)
to one of the following error numbers:
.TP \w'[\fBNC_NOMOREENTRIES\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ NC_NOERROR ]
.RI \(lq "no error" \(rq
.br
The last network selection function called was successful or no network selection function has yet
been called.
.TP
.RB [ NC_NOMEM ]
.RI \(lq "out of memory" \(rq
.br
There was not sufficient memory for the last network selection function called to complete.
.TP
.RB [ NC_NOSET ]
.RI \(lq "routine called before calling setnetpath() or setnetconfig()" \(rq
.br
The last call to
.BR endnetpath ()
or
.BR getnetpath (3)
was called (incorrectly) before calling
.BR setnetpath (3).
.TP
.RB [ NC_OPENFAIL ]
.RI \(lq "cannot open /etc/netconfig" \(rq
.br
The last call to a network selection function,
.BR setnetpath (3),
could not open the
.B /etc/netconfig
file.
.TP
.RB [ NC_BADLINE ]
.RI \(lq "error in /etc/netconfig : field %d of line %d" \(rq
.br
The last call to a network selection function detected a syntax error in the
.B /etc/netconfig
file at field
.I %d
of line
.IR %d .
.TP
.RB [ NC_NOTFOUND ]
.RI \(lq "netid not found in /etc/netconfig" \(rq
.br
The
.I netid
argument to the last call to
.BR getnetconfigent (3)
was not found in
.BR /etc/netconfig .
.TP
.RB [ NC_NOMOREENTRIES ]
.RI \(lq "no more entries in /etc/netconfig" \(rq
.br
The last call to network selection function
.BR getnetpath (3)
exhausted the entries in the
.B /etc/netconfig
file.
.TP
.RB [ ??? ]
.RI \(lq "unknown error" \(rq
.br
An internal error occurred in the
.BR libxnsl (3)
library.
.PP
An error string associated with the error number can be obtained using
.BR nc_sperror (3)
or printed to standard error with
.BR nc_perror (3).

has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR endnetpath ()
is compatible with
.I "SVR 4.2"
.[

.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[

.]
including
.IR AIX \(rg,

.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.[
hpuxdoc
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7doc
.]
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The
.IR Solaris \(rg
.I TIRPCSRC Version 2.8
version of
.BR getnetpath ()
is not thread-safe.  This
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation is thread-safe.
.IP \(em
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
stores the error condition in
.IR nc_error (3).
.IP \(em
Diagnostic message strings are not documented and are incompatible.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility would only be coincidental.
.IP \(em
On
.IR UNIX \(rg
systems, these utility subroutines are normally part of the Network Services
Library,
.BR libnsl ;
however,
.B Linux
already has a library of that name (which unfortunately is missing these
components), and, therefore,
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
renames the library to
.BR libxnsl (3).
.PP
See
.BR libxnsl (3)
for additional compatibility information.
