.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR ft_frdir ()
function reads the contents of the directory pathname in the file-store
identified by
.IR p_address .
A list of zero or more FTAM-Attributes objects is returned, one for each file
in the remote directory.  The order of files in this list is determined by the
source file-store.
The
.BR ft_frdir ()
function uses the NBS-9 document type to retrieve directory information from
the remote file-store.  The function may fail if the remote file-store does not
support this document type.  Two factors may constrain the list of attributes
returned for each file:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
The FTAM file attribute groups negotiated for the connection with the FTAM
responder may limit the list of attributes that are requested for each file.
.IP \(bu
The attributes that the remote FTAM responder supports for the NBS-9 file type
may limit the list of attributes returned for each file.  The definition of the
NBS-9 document type requires only that the Filename attribute is returned for
each file.
.\"

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.BI session " (Private Object (Session))
This parameter is a handle for a private object of class Session that
identifies the particular XFTAM instance that is to perform the required XFTAM
operation.  The session identifies the resources associated with the instance,
including the XOM workspace that contains all private objects passed to or
returned from this XFTAM function call.
.TP
.BI p_address " (Object (Presentation-Address))
This parameter is a handle for an object of class Presentation Address.  If
present, the Association-Id attribute of API-Input-Parameters shall be absent
as the operation is being carried out in context free mode.  When present, this
attribute identifies the FTAM responder that serves the remote filestore.  If
not present, the Association-Id attribute of API-Input-Parameters shall be
present as the operation is being carried out in context sensitive mode.  If
both P-address and Association-Id are present, the function returns an error
code
.RB [ FT_CONTEXT_MISMATCH ].
.TP
.BI pathname " (String(Octet))
The name of the directory file for which a file list is to be retrieved.
.TP
.BI attribute_names " (Object(FTAM_Attribute_names))
This optional parameter is a handle for an object of class
FTAM-Attribute-Names that indicates the file attributes from the kernel or
negotiated FTAM attribute group to read.  If not specified,
.I attribute_names
defaults to the attribute filename only.  The attributes that may be read
are:
.RS
.RS
.PP

.PP
If the underlaying FTAM service provider fails to negotiate the use of an FTAM
attribute group required for one of the specified attributes, the function
returns an error.  A request to read attributes other than those listed here
also results in an error.  A mandatory parameter, given in the syntax used by
the real filestore containing the file.
.RE
.TP
.BI ftam_in " (Object (FTAM-Input-Parameters))
This parameter is a handle for an object of class FTAM-Input-Parameters,
specifying general FTAM parameters for use in this function.  The parameter is
optional.  However, failure to specify some of its OM attributes may result in
the remote responder rejecting the requested file actions.  For the
.BR ft_frdir ()
the following attributes of this object may be set:
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
.B Account.
.br
If context-sensitive processing mode is in use for this operation
(Association-Id is present), this parameter is optional.
.RS
.PP
When present, for the duration of this file transfer or file management
function, it overrides the current identified account to which charges are
made (as defined when
.BR ft_connect (3)
created the association).  In this case, charges for this operation are
returned upon completion.
.PP
When not present, the account identified when
.BR ft_connect (3)
created the association is used for any charges, and no charging information
is returned when this function completes, all charging information being
returned when the association is destroyed by
.BR ft_disconnect (3).
.RE
.IP \(bu
.B File-Passwords.
.br
This parameter is used to specify file passwords for the FTAM file actions to
be performed.  Set the read password if filename contains an access control
element that specifies a password for this action.
.IP \(bu
.B Concurrency-Control.
.br
This parameter is used to specify concurrency locks for the FTAM file actions
to be performed.  Set the read concurrency key if filename contains an access
control element that specifies a lock for this action.
.PP
If context-sensitive processing mode is in use for this function call
(Association-Id is present), the following parameters should not be present as
they have already been provided when the association was created.  In this
case, if any of these are present, the function returns an error code
.RB [ FT_CONTEXT_MISMATCH ].
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Initiator-Identity
.IP \(em
Filestore-Password
.IP \(em
FQoS.
.RE
.RE
.TP
.BI api_in " (Object (API-Input-Parameters))
This optional parameter is the handle of an object of class
API-Input-Parameters, that may contain API-specific parameters for use in
this function call.
.RS
.PP
If context-sensitive processing mode is in use, this parameter contains the
Association-Id for an existing association.  If the Association-Id provided
does not represent an active association within the FTAM instance identified
by Session, the function returns an error code
.RB [ FTE_INV_ASSOC ].
.RE
.TP
.BI directory_list " (Private Object (Directory-List))
If successful, this parameter is a handle for a private object of class
Directory-List that contains a list of zero or more FTAM-Attribute objects,
one for each file in the directory accessed.  Only values of attributes from
groups supported by responder for the NBS-9 document type are returned.
.TP
.BI ftam_out " (Private Object (FTAM-Output-Parameters))
This parameter is a handle for a private object of class
FTAM-Output-Parameters, and is returned only if there are relevant FTAM output
parameters to be returned as a result of the FTAM actions performed.
.RS
.PP
If context-sensitive processing mode is in use, the following specific
parameter use applies:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
.B Charging-List.
.br
If an override account was provided (in the account attribute within
.IR ftam_in ),
any charges returned are those for this function only and do not include
connection changes.  The charges returned here are not included in the charges
returned when the association is destroyed with
.BR ft_disconnect (3).
.RE
.TP
.BI api_out " (Private Object (API-Output-Parameters))
This parameter is always returned and is a handle for a private object of
class API-Output-Parameters.  It returns API-specific output parameters for
this function call.
