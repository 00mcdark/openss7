.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A data value of this type is used for requesting the features of a session.
The object identifiers identifying the features defined in this specification
are as follows:
.TP
.B MS Package
.I ms-pkg(1)
The Message Store Package is mandatory.
.TP
.B MS General Attributes Package
.I ms-general-attr-pkg(2)
The Message Store General Attributes Package is mandatory.
.TP
.B MS IM Attributes Package
.I ms-im-attr-pkg(3)
The Message Store Interpersonal Message Attributes Package is optional.
.TP
.B MS FU
.I ms-fu(4)
The Message Store Functional Unit is mandatory.
.TP
.B MS Submission FU
.I ms-submission-fu(5)
The Message Store Submission Functional Unit is optional.
.TP
.B MS Administration FU
.I ms-administration-fu(6)
The Message Store Adminsitration Functional Unit is optional.
.TP
.B MS Alert FU
.I ms-alert-fu(7)
The Message Store Alert Functional Unit is optional.
.PP
The XMS
.[
XMS
.]
specification defined three packages, of which two are mandatory and one is
optional.  Use of optional packages is negotiated through the
.I feature_list
argument of the
.BR ms_initialize (3)
function.  The packages defined are as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
The
.IR "Message Store Package" ,
with Errors, is mandatory.
.IP \(bu
The
.IR "Message Store General Attributes Package" ,
is mandatory.
.IP \(bu
The
.IR "Message Store Interpersonal Messaging Attributes Package" ,
is optional.
.PP
The service makes an optoinal feature available to the client only if the
client requests it.  The client may request a set of features through the
.I feature_list
argument to the
.BR ms_initalize (3)
function: the MS FU, the MS Package and the MS General Attributes Package are
provided by the service as default.
.PP
The following occurs if the client attempts to use a feature that the service
has not made available.  If the MS FU is available and the client invokes a
function in the other FUs, but that FU is unavailable, the
.I feature-unavailable
.RB [ MS_E_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE ]
error arises.
.PP
After initializing the interface with certain features negotiated, if the
client attempts to invoke a function not previously requested, the
.I feature-no-requested
.RB [ MS_E_FEATURE_NOT_REQUESTED ]
error arises.
.PP
If the client supplies, as a function argument, an object, one of whose
subobjects is an instance of a class not in any of the packages the interface
hass been initialized with, the
.I no-such-class
.RB [ MS_E_NO_SUCH_CLASS ]
error arises.
.PP
The XMS
.[
XMS

specification does not mandate that any OM classes be encodable using
.BR om_encode (3)
and
.BR om_decode (3).
