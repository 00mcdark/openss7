.SH NAME

\- change the relative distinguished name (RDN) or a leaf entry
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xds.h>
.HP
.BI "DS_status ds_modify_rdn(OM_private object " session ", OM_private_object " context ", OM_object " name ", OM_object " new_RDN ", OM_boolean " delete_old_RDN ", OM_sint *" invoke_id_return );
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
XDS
.[
XDS
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to change the RDN of a leaf entry (either an object entry
or an alias entry).
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.IR session "\0\fBSession\fP(Object(Session)).
The directory session against which this operation is performed.  This must be
a private object.
.TP
.IR context "\0\fBContext\fP(Object(Context)).
The directory context to be used for this operation.  Note that
.B size-Limite
and
.B dont-Dereference-Aliases
do not apply to this operation.  This argument must be a private object or the
constant
.RB { DS_DEFAULT_CONTEXT }.
.TP
.IR name "\0\fBName\fP(Object(Name)).
The current name of the target leaf entry.  Any aliases in the name will
.I not
be dereferenced.  The immediate superior should not have any non-specific
subroutine references, otherwise, the function may fail with an Update-Error
(affects-multiple-DSAs).  (A non-specific subordinate reference is an
indication that another DSA holds some number of children, but does not
indicate their RDNs.  This means that it is not possible to check the
uniqueness of the requested new RDN within a single DSA.)
.TP
.IR new_RDN "\0\fBNew-RDN\fP(Object(Relative Name)).
If an attribute in the new RDN does not already exist in the entry (either as
part of the old RDN or as a non-distinguished value), the new value is added.
If it cannot be added, an error is reported.
.TP
.IR delete_old_RDN "\0\fBDelete-Old-RDN\fP(Object(Boolean)).
If this value is
.BR true ,
all attribute values that are in the old RDN but not in the new RDN are
deleted.  If the value is
.BR false ,
the old values should remain in the entry (not as part of the RDN).  The value
must be
.B true
when a single value in the RDN has its value changed by the operation.  If this
operation removes the last attribute value of an attribute, that attribute will
be deleted.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.BR Status "(Status)
Whether the name of the entry was changed or not, if use syncrhonously, or
whether the operation was initiated, if used ansynchronously.
.TP
.BR Invoke-ID "(Integer)
The
.B Invoke-ID
of an asyncrhonous directory operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
This function can return a System-Error or one of the following Library-Errors:
bad-argument, bad-class, bad-context, bad-name, bad-session, bad workspace,
miscellaneous, missing-type, too-many-operations.
.PP
The following Directory-Errors may be returned by the function (or by
.BR ds_receive_result (3)
when used asynchronously):
Attribute-Error, Name-Error, Referral, Security-Error, Service-Error,
Update-Error.
.PP
The Update-Error (affects-multiple-DSAs) that is referred to in the argument
descriptions need not be returned if there is local agreement between the DSAs
to allow the entry to be modified.
.PP
This function can return a Communications-Error.
.PP
This function can return the error constant
.RB [ DS_NO_WORKSPACE ].
