.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A data value of this type is a descriptor, which embodies an attribute value.
A sequence of descriptors (an array in C) can represent all the values of all
the attributes of an object, and is the representation called a Public Object.
A descriptor has the following components:
.TP
.IR Type \%\0(Type)
Identifies the type of the attribute value.
.TP
.IR Syntax \%\0(Syntax)
Identifies the syntax of the attribute value.
.sp
In the C interface,
.I Long-String
to
.IR Private ,
below,
are encoded in the high-order bits of this structure member.  The syntax should
always be masked with the constant,
.RB ( OM_S_SYNTAX ),
because of this.  The macros
.BR OM_SYNTAX ()
and
.BR OM_SYNTAX_ASSIGN ()
are provided for this purpose.
.TP
.IR Long-String \%\0(Boolean)
True, if, and only if, the descriptor is service-generated and the length of
the value is greater than an implementation-defined limit.
.sp
In the C interface, this component occupies bit 15 (0x8000) of the
.I syntax
member and is represented by the constant
.RB ( OM_S_LONG_STRING ).
.sp
The macro,
.BR OM_IS_LONG_STRING (),
may be used to test this flag.
.TP
.IR No-Value \%\0(Boolean)
Only true if the descriptor is service-generated and the value is not present
(because
.B exclude-values
or
.B exclude-multiples
was set in the call to
.IR Get ()).
.sp
In the C interface, this component occupies bit 14 (0x4000) of the
.I syntax
member and is represented by the constant
.RB ( OM_S_NO_VALUE ).
.sp
The macro,
.BR OM_HAS_VALUE (),
may be used to test this flag.
.TP
.IR Local-String \%\0(Boolean)
Only significant if the
.IR Syntax " is " String(*) .
True if, and only if, the string is represented by an implementation-defined
local character set.  The local character set may be more amenable for use as
keyboard inut or display output than the non-local character set, and may
include specific treatment of line terminal sequences.  Certain interface
functions may convert information in string syntaxes to or from the local
representation, which may result in a loss of information.
.sp
In the C interface, this component occupies bit 13 (0x2000) of the
.I syntax
member and is represented by the constant
.RB ( OM_S_LOCAL_STRING ).
.sp
The macro,
.BR OM_IS_LOCAL_STRING (),
may be used to test this flag, and,
.BR OM_SET_LONG_STRING (),
to set it.
.TP
.IR Service-Generated \%\0(Boolean)
True, if, and only if, the descriptor is service-generated and the first
descriptor of a public object, or the defined part of a private object.
.sp
In the C interface, this component occupies bit 12 (0x1000) of the
.I syntax
member and is represented by the constant
.RB ( OM_S_SERVICE_GENERATED ).
.sp
The macro,
.BR OM_IS_SERVICE_GENERATED (),
may be used to test this flag.
.TP
.IR Private \%\0(Boolean)
True if, and only if, the descriptor in the service-generated public object
contains a reference to the handle of a private subobject, or in the defined
part of a private object.
.sp
(Note: This applies only when the descriptor is service-generated.  The client
need not set this bit in a client-generated descriptor containing a reference
to a private object.)
.sp
In the C interface, this component occupies bit 11 (0x0800) of the
.I syntax
member and is represented by the constant
.RB ( OM_S_PRIVATE ).
.TP
.IR Value \%\0(Value)
The attribute value.
