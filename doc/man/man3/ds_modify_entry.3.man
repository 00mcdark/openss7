.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "DS_status ds_modify_entry(OM_private object " session ", OM_private_object " context ", OM_object " name ", OM_object " changes ", OM_sint *" invoke_id_return );
.\"

.SH INTERFACE
.PP
XDS
.[
XDS
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to make a series of one or more of the following changes
to a single directory entry:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
add a new attribute
.RB ( add-attribute )
.IP \(bu
remove an attribute
.RB ( remove-attribute )
.IP \(bu
add attribute values
.RB ( add-values )
.IP \(bu
remove attribute values
.RB ( remove-values ).
.PP
Values may be replaced by a combination of adding values and removing values in
a single operation.  The RDN can only be changed by using the
.BR ds_modify_rdn (3)
function.
.PP
The result of the operation is as if each modification is made in the order
specified in the
.I changes
argument.  If any of the individual modifications fails, then an
Attribute-Error is reported and the entry is left as it was prior to the whole
operation.  The operation is atomic; either all or none of the changes are
made.  The directory checks that the resulting entry conforms to the directory
schema.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.IR session "\0\fBSession\fP(Object(Session)).
The directory session agains which this operation is performed.  This must be a
private object.
.TP
.IR context "\0\fBContext\fP(Object(Context)).
The directory context to be used for this operation.  Note that
.B size-Limit
and
.B dont-Dereference-Aliases
do not apply to this operation.  This argument must be a private object or the
constant
.RB { DS_DEFAULT_CONTEXT }.
.TP
.IR name "\0\fBName\fP(Object(Name)).
The name of the target object entry.  Any aliases in the name will
.I not
be dereferenced.
.TP
.IR changes "\0(Object(Entry-Mod-List)).
A sequence of modifications to the named entry.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.BR Status "(Status)
Takes the value
.B success
if all the modifications succeeded and takes an error value if not, when the
function is used synchronously.  Reports whether the operation was initiated,
if used asynchronously.
.TP
.BR Invoke-ID "(Integer)
The
.B Invoke-ID
of an asyncrhonous directory operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
This function can return a System-Error or one of the following Library-Errors:
bad-argumnet, bad-class, bad-context, bad-name, bad-session, bad-workspace,
miscellaneous, missing-type, too-many-operations.
.PP
The following Directory-Errors may be returned by the function (or by
.BR ds_receive_result (3)
when used asynchronously):
Attribute-Error, Name-Error, Referral, Security-Error, Service-Error,
Update-Error.
.PP
Attempting to use
.B add-attribute
to add an existing attribute results in an Attribute-Error.  Attempting to use
.B add-values
to add an existing value results in an Attribute-Error, as does an attempt to
add a value to a non-existent attribute type.  Attempting to use
.B remove-attribute
to remove a non-existing attribute results in an Attribute-Error, while an
attempt to remove an attribute that is part of the object's RDN results in an
Update-Error.  Attempting to use
.B remove-values
to remove a non-existing value results in an Attribute-Error, while an attempt
to remove a value of an attribute that is part of the object's RDN, or to
modify the object class attribute, results in an Update-Error.
.PP
This function can return a Communications-Error.
.PP
This function can return the error constant
.RB [ DS_NO_WORKSPACE ].
