.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function associates the Presentation Address stored in the
.B AP_BIND_PADDR
environment variable with the XAP
.[
xap c303
.]
Instances specified by
.IR fd .
Upon successful completion the service provider may begin enqueueing incoming
associations or sending outbound associations requests.  All necessary
environment variables (e.g.
.BR AP_BIND_PADDR ,
.BR AP_ROLE_ALLOWED )
should be set prior to calling
.BR ap_bind ().
.PP
When this function is called, an attempt may be made to bind to the specified
address.  As a part of the bind procedure, an authorization check may be
performed to verify that all of the processes that share this XAP instance are
authorized to use the new address.  If all are authorized to do so, the bind
request will succeed and the XAP instance may be used to send (receive)
primitives from (addressed to) the new address.  Successfully calling this
function causes the state of XAP to move from
.BR AP_UNBOUND " to " AP_IDLE .
.PP
Some implementations may perform no authorization checking.  In this case the
.RB [ AP_ACCES ]
error response will not be returned.  Other implementations may defer binding
and authorization until a
.BR A_ASSOC_REQ " or " A_ASSOC_RSP
primitive is issued.  In this case, if the authorization check fails, the
.RB [ AP_ACCES ]
error will be returned by
.BR ap_snd (3).
The local address can be changed to an acceptable value and the primitive
reissued, or the connection can be closed.
.PP
An instance can be bound to a presentation address only if all of the processes
that share it are authorized to use the requested address.  Consequently, when
an attempt is made to bind an address, the effective UIDs of all of the
processes that share this instance of XAP may be checked against the list of
users allowed to use the requested address. If all are authorized to use the
address,
.BR ap_bind ()
succeeds and the instance is bound to the specified presentation address. On the
other hand, if any of the processes is not authorized to use the requested
address,
.BR ap_bind ()
fails and the instance remains unbound.
.I aperrno_p
must be set to point to a location which will be used to carry an error code
back to the user.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero
.RB ( 0 )
is returned. Otherwise, a value of
minus one
.RB ( -1 )
is returned and the location pointed to by
.I aperrno_p
is set to indicate the error.

.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
In the OpenSS7 implementation,
.BR ap_open (3)
results in the opening of a Stream on the Transport Provider (TP),
.B /dev/tp
pseudo-device driver, and pushing of the ACSE/Presentation Module (APMOD),
.RB \*(lq apmod \*(rq.
This may also be accomplished by opening an device minor number on the TP
driver for which an autopush specification has been made, commonly called
.BR /dev/oopi .
Assigning
.B AP_BIND_PADDR
and, possibly,
.B AP_ROLE_ALLOWED
is accomplished using
.BR ap_set_env ().
This associates those attributes with the environment associated with the
Stream.  This is vague way of saying that these options are set on the Stream;
either in a library structure associated with the file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
by the library, or in a kernel resident structure associated with the Stream.
.PP
Multiple processes may have access to the same Stream which corresponds to
multiple processes having access to the same APLI or XAP instance.
On the other hand, multiple APLI or XAP instances may share the same transport
provider.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR ap_bind ()
is compatible with APLI
.[
apli unix international

and XAP,
.[
xap c303

and implementations based on APLI or XAP, such as
.IR "USL ONP" \(rg,
.IR "Solaris Solstice OSI" \(rg,
.IR "HP-UX OTS/9000" \(rg,
.IR "AIX OSI/6000" \(rg,
.IR "Digital DECnet/OSI" \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Only source compatibility is attempted.
Binary compatibility is not
attempted: any exhibited binary compatibility is coincidental and is scheduled
to be removed on the next release.

.SH HISTORY

.BR ap_bind ()
first appeared in XAP.

In the older APLI library, there was no separate function for bind: binding was
enabled whenever the
.B AP_BIND_PADDR
environment variable was set.
