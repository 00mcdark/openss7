.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include <xds.h>
.HP
.BI "DS_status ds_abandon(OM_private_object " session ", OM_sint " invoke_id );

.SH INTERFACE

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function abandons the result of an outstanding asyncrhonous function
call.  The function is no longer outstanding after this function returns, and
the result will never be returned by
.BR ds_receive_result (3).
.PP
Note that this function may, but need not, cause an \*(lqAbandon\*(rq
operation to be requested of the directory.  Such an \*(lqAbandon\*(rq
operation may, but need not, cause the directory to abandon the outstanding
asynchronous operation itself.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.BR ds_abandon ()
takes the following arguments:
.TP
.IR session "\0\fBSession\fP(Object(Session))
The directory session in which the operation was submitted to the directory.
This must be a private object, see
.BR XOM (3).
.TP
.IR invoke_id "\0\fBInvoke-ID\fP(Integer)
Selects the specific outstanding asyncrhonous operation submitted via the
.B Session
to be terminated.  The operation must be interrogation (that is,
.BR ds_compare "(3), " ds_list "(3), " ds_read "(3) or " ds_search (3)).
The value of
.B Invoke-ID
must be that which was returned by the function call
that initiated the asyncrhonous directory operation to be abandonned.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.BR Status "(Status)
Whether the function succeeded or not.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
This function can return a System-Error or one of the following
Library-Errors: bad-session, miscellaneous.
.PP
This function can return a Communications-Error or the following
Directory-error: Abandon-Failed.  Note that the result of the asyncrhonous
operation will not be returned even if an Abandon-Failed error is returned.
.PP
This function can return the error constant
.RB [ DS_NO_WORKSPACE ],
.RB [ DS_INVALID_WORKSPACE ]
or
.RB [ DS_SUCCESS ].
