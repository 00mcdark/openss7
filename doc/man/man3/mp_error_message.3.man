.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function returns an error message string which describes the error.  The caller provides a
buffer-address and buffer-length argument.  The error message text is stored in the client's buffer.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I error
The error number returned as a status from another XMP library call.
.TP
.I length
The length of the buffer.  The error text buffer is an unsigned character array.  This is necessary
if the intent is to support NLS (the X/Open Native Language System).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.I length_return
Indicates the length of the returned message.  If the
.I length
parameter is zero (0) or the
.I error_text_return
parameter is
.BR NULL ,
then the
.I length_return
value indicates the amount of buffer space required to hold the error message.
.TP
.I error_text_return
A message describing the error.  The error message text is termianted by a NUL character.  The error
message text will be truncated if the length of the error-text buffer is less than the length of the
error message text.

.SH ERRORS
.PP
This function returns no errors.  (A default error message reports faulty arguments or other
problems).
