.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dlpi_info
is a DLPI Library
.[
soldoc11
.]
subroutine.
This DLPI Library function returns information obtained from the DLS provider
concerning the state and characteristics of the DLPI Stream.  This is
accomplished internally using the
.BR DL_INFO_REQ "(7) and " DL_INFO_ACK (7)
primitives of the DLPI.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
Most of the information returned in the \fBdlpi_info_t\fP structure pointed to
by the \fIinfop\fP argument to the call are taken directly from the
.BR DL_INFO_ACK (7)
response.  One exception is the \fIdi_linkname\fP field, which is set to the
same name as was passed as the \fIlinkname\fP argument to the
.BR dlpi_open (3)
call.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B dlpi_info
function, include
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
and
.RB < dlpi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -ldlpi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B dlpi_info
function or include the
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.a
static library object as an target of the linking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B dlpi_info
is fully thread-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B dlpi_info
is successful, it returns \fBDLPI_SUCCESS\fP.
When
.B dlpi_info
fails, it returns DLPI Library, DLPI or \fBLinux\fP system error code.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B dlpi_info
fails, it returns DLPI Library, DLPI or \fBLinux\fP system error code.

.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
Insufficient \fISTREAMS\fP resources were available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
A temporary failure occurred and the DLS user should reissue the request.
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
THe control information in the request has already been subjected to the
control request or a transient condition prevented the request.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
On of the parameters of the requst for which there is no prescribed error code
has an invalid value.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTSUP ]
The request is recognized by not supported.

Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
