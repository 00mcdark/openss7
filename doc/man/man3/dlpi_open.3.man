.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dlpi_open
is a DLPI Library
.[
soldoc11
.]
subroutine.
The
.B dlpi_open
library subroutine
opens a new DLPI Stream and prepares the Stream for use by moving the Stream to
the
.B DL_UNBOUND
state.
.PP
The \fIlinkname\fP argument specifies the string that corresponds to the
\fBLinux\fP system device name: e.g., \fB\*(lqeth0\*(rq\fP.  The library
subroutine call determines the device name and other particulars necessary to
open and attach the DLPI Stream, moving it to the \fBDL_UNBOUND\fP state.
.PP
To avoid mapping file descriptors to associated user-space data structures, the
.B dlpi_open
call returns a data link handle into the area pointed to by the \fIdhp\fP
argument to the call.  This data link handle can be used for subsequent calls
referencing the Stream.  The actual file descriptor associated with the open
Stream can be obtained using the
.BR dlpi_fd (3)
DLPI library call.
.PP
The \fIflags\fP argument to the call provides some flags that control the mode
of the DLPI Stream that remain in effect for the duration that the Stream
remains open.  These flags are as follows:
.TP
.B DLPI_RAW
sets raw mode of operation.  The raw mode of operation is invoked on the Stream
with the
.BR DLIOCRAW
input-output control described in
.BR dlpi_ioctl (4).
The
.BR DLIOCRAW
command puts the stream into a raw mode, which, upon receive, causes the full
MAC-level packet to be sent upstream in an
.BR M_DATA (9)
message instead of it being transformed into the
.BR DL_UNITDATA_IND (7)
form normally used for reporting incoming packets in accordance with the DLPI
specification.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
Packet SAP filtering is still performed on Streams that are in raw mode.  If a
Stream user wants to receive all incoming packets it must also select the
appropriate promiscuous modesl using the
.BR dlpi_promiscon (3)
library call.  After successfully selecting raw mode, the application is also
allowed to sen fully formatted packets to the driver as
.BR M_DATA (9)
messages for transmission.  Once enabled, the Stream remains in this mode until
closed.
.TP
.B DLPI_NATIVE
sets the native mode of operation.  The native mode of operation is invoked on
the Stream with the
.BR DLIOCNATIVE
input-output control described in
.BR dlpi_ioctl (4).
Some DLPI providers may be able to represent their link layer using more than
one link layer format.  In this case, the default link layer format may
minimize impact to applications, but may not allow truly native link layer
headers to be sent or received.  DLS users who wish to use the native link
layer format can use
.BR DLIOCNATIVE
to transition the Stream.
.BR DLIOCNATIVE
returns the DLPI MAC Type associated with the new link-layer format.  Once
enabled, the Stream remains in this mode until closed.  Note that
.BR DLIOCNATIVE
does not enable transition between dissimilar DLPI MAC types and (aside from
the link layer format), the new DLPI MAC type is guaranteed to be semantically
identical.  In particular, the SAP space and addressing format are not affected
and the effect of
.BR DLIOCNATIVE
is only visible when in raw mode, though any subsequent
.BR dlpi_info (3)
requests generate a response with \fIdli_mac_type\fP set to the native DLPI
type.
.TP
.B DLPI_PASSIVE
sets the passive mode of operation.  The passive mode of operation is invoked
on the Stream with the
.BR DL_PASSIVE_REQ (7)
extension primitive.
This mode requests that the DLS provider Stream be permitted access to
individual data link that are part of an aggregate.

.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B dlpi_open
function, include
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
and
.RB < dlpi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -ldlpi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B dlpi_open
function or include the
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.a
static library object as an target of the linking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B dlpi_open
is fully thread-safe.
What is described as global variables are in fact thread-specific data when
linked with
.BR libpthread .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B dlpi_open
is successful, it returns \fBDLPI_SUCCESS\fP.
When
.B dlpi_open
fails, it returns an error code
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B dlpi_open
is compatible with the
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
.[
soldoc11
.]
and systems providing an interface equivalent to
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The \fISolaris\fP\(rg version of the DLPI library uses the link name,
\fIlinkname\fP, to search the \fB/dev\fP directory for a suitable Style 1 or
Style 2 device.
.RS
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses a slightly different approach based on the fact that the underlying system
is a \fBLinux\fP networking system where device drivers have assigned device
names outside the namespace of the \fB/dev\fP directory.
Under the
.B OpenSS7
DLPI library, the link name, \fIlinkname\fP, is used as a \fBLinux\fP device
name.  For example, the \fIlinkname\fP may be specified as \fB\*(lqeth0\*(rq\fP.
.RE
.IP \(em
The \fBDLPI_DEVONLY\fP and \fBDLPI_SERIAL\fP flags are undocumented in the
\fISolaris\fP\(rg DLPI Library.  They should not even be used by
\fISolaris\fP\(rg programs.
.IP \(em
.B DLPI Library
functions are
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
applications programs, drivers and modules to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the DLPI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
