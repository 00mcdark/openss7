.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.IR UNIX \(rg
has traditionally provided three components of the Network Services Library,
.BR libnsl ,
that are associated with Transport Provider Interface,
.BR tpi (7),
.IR STREAMS (9)
network pseudo-device drivers, and that are not currently part of the
.B Linux
Network Services Library.  These components are:
.IP 1. \w'1.\(em'u
Network Configuration database access, see
.BR netconfig (3).
.PD 0
.IP 2.
Network Path access, see
.BR netpath (3).
.IP 3.
Name-to-Address Translation, see
.BR netdir (3).
.PD
.PP
The last is referred to as the Name-to-Address Translation facility of the
Network Services Library.
.PP
The
.BR netdir (3)
component (of which
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
is a member) consists of an interface that provides a set of Name-to-Address
Translation subroutines for transport independence:
.BR netdir_getbyname (3),
.BR netdir_getbyaddr (3),
.BR netdir_options (3),
.BR taddr2uaddr "(), and
.BR uaddr2taddr ().
.PP
Of these,
.BR taddr2uaddr "() and " uaddr2taddr ()
provide a mechanism for trasnlating between transport specific address formats
and a universal address format in a character string.
.PP
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
provides an address translation service for the network transport protocol sepcified with a pointer
to a
.BR netconfig (5s)
structure,
.IR config .
The
.I config
pointer is acquired using the
.BR getnetconfig (3),
.BR getnetconfigent (3)
or
.BR getnetpath (3)
subroutines and describes a particular transport protocol from the
.BR netconfig (5s)
network configuration database.
The transport address to translate to a universal address string is specified as a pointer to a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure,
.IR addr ,
that contains the transport address as it is passed to and from the transport provider.
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
returns a pointer to a character string representing the universal address that corresponds to the
transport address.
.PP
Once the character string representing the universal address is no longer required, it is freed by
passing its pointer to
.BR free (3).
.\"
.\"
.SS "STRUCTURE FORMAT"
.PP
The
.B netconfig
structure is defined in
.RB < netconfig.h >
and described in
.BR netconfig (3)
and
.BR netconfig (5s).
.PP
The
.BR netbuf (3)
structure is defined in
.RB < xti.h >
and described in
.BR netbuf (3).
.PP
Upon successful return, the returned character string pointer points to an allocated null terminated
string.
.\"
.\"
.SS "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The format of the
.B /etc/netconfig
Network Configuration database file is as described in
.BR netconfig (5s).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Procedure for usage of the
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
subroutine is to first acquire a pointer to a
.BR netconfig (3)
structure representing an entry in the
.BR netconfig (5s)
database using a function such as
.BR getnetconfig (3),
.BR getnetconfigent (3)
or
.BR getnetpath (3).
Then a transport address is placed in a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure (perhaps as returned by
.BR t_bind (3)
or
.BR t_accept (3))
and passed to the
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
function.  The returned character string contains the universal address representing the
transport address.
Once the character string is not longer required, it is freed with
.BR free (3)
by passing the character string pointer as the argument.
.PP
For Internet Protocol transports, (that is when
.I config
points to a
.BR netconfig (5s)
structure corresponding to an Internet Protocol Version 4 or Version 6 network),
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
is roughly equivalent to
.BR inet_ntoa (3);
however,
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
is more general and applies to networks other than
.I inet
or
.IR inet6 .
Also,
.BR inet_ntoa (3)
neither accepts nor translates a service component to a port number in the resulting
numbers-and-dots universal address.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
returns a
.RB non- NULL
character string pointer to an allocated universal address string.
Otherwise,
.B NULL
is returned and
.BR _nderror (3)
is set to indicate the error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
fails, it returns
.B NULL
and sets
.BR _nderror (3)
to one of the following error codes:
.TP \w'[\fBND_NO_RECOVERY\fR]\(em'u

might also provide some insight into the error.

An internal error occured in the

is the decimal number of the error number that was contained in
.BR _nderror (3).
.PP
When an error occurs, an error message can be printed to standard error or retrieved using
.BR netdir_perror (3)
or
.BR netdir_sperror (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR netdir_perror (3)
and
.BR netdir_sperror (3)
must be called immediately after the failed network configuration subroutine fails.  Otherwise, the
error condition in
.BR _nderror (3)
may be lost.
.PP
The character string to which a pointer is returned must eventually be freed by passing it to
.BR free (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Name to address lookup libraries that will have their
.BR _taddr2uaddr ()
dynamic symbols called to perform the lookup will be searched in the order that they appear in the
.I nc_lookups
member of the specified
.BR netconfig (5s)
structure,
.IR config .
If
.I config
specifies an
.I inet
or
.I inet6
network, and the number of lookup libraries,
.IR nc_nlookups ,
is zero, the standard BSD inet translation functions will be used.
.PP
.BR _taddr2uaddr ()
is the symbol provided by shared object lookup libraries to implement
.BR taddr2uaddr ().
If the library does not implement
.BR _taddr2uaddr (),
.BR taddr2uaddr ()
will fail, return
.B NULL
and set
.BR _nderror (3)
to
.RB [ ND_NOSYM ].
