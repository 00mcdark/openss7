.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to retrieve the completed result of a previous
asynchronous operation invocation.  The \fIcompletion_flag\fP parameter
indicates if an outstanding invocation has completed, if so the other
parameters are used to return the invocation identifier and output object
handles associated with the completed operation.  The result of a completed
outstanding invocation will be returned exactly once.
.PP
Asynchronous execution mode is an optional feature of XFTAM.  If an
implementation does not support this feature,
.BR ft_rcvresult ()
returns an error code of
.RB [ FTE_NOTSUP_ASYNC ].
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.BI session " (Private Object (Session))
This parameter is a handle for a private object of class Session that
identifies the particular XFTAM instance that is to perform the required XFTAM
operation.  The session identifies the resources associated with the instance,
including the XOM workspace that contains all private objects passed to or
returned from this XFTAM function call.
.TP
.BI completion_flag (Integer)
One of the following values to indicate the status of outstanding asynchronous
operations:
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
FT_COMPLETED_INVOKATION
.br
At least one outstanding invocation has completed and its result is made
available.
.IP \(bu
FT_OUTSTANDING_INVOKATIONS
.br
There are outstanding invocations, but none has yet completed.
.IP \(bu
FT_NO_OUTSTANDING_INVOKATIONS
.br
There are no outstanding invocations.
.PP
Upon successful return with completion_flag having the value
.RB [ FT_COMPLETED_INVOKATION ],
the Invoke-ID and the return object handles associated with the completed
invocation are returned as noted below.
.RE
.TP
.BI op_invoke_id " (Integer)
This parameter is used to return the Invoke-ID of a completed operation.  The
value returned can be matched to those returned by outstanding asynchronous
operations.  It is only valid if the completion_flag parameter returned
.RB [ FT_COMPLETED_INVOKATION ].
.TP
.BI op_api_out " (Private Object (API-Output-Parameters))
This parameter is used to return an object handle for the
API-Output-Parameters associated with the completed invocation.  It is only
valid if the completion_flag parameter returned
.RB [ FT_COMPLETED_INVOKATION ].
.TP
.BI op_ftam_out " (Private Object (FTAM-Output-Parameters))
This parameter is used to return an object handle for the
FTAM-Output-Parameters associated with the completed invocation.  It is only
valid if the completion_flag parameter returned
.RB [ FT_COMPLETED_INVOKATION ]
and op_api_out indicated that the asynchronous operation succeeded.
.TP
.BI op_result_object " (Private Object (Object))
This parameter is used to return an object handle for a possible output object
associated with the completed operation.  It is only valid if the
.I completion_flag
parameter returned
.RB [ FT_COMPLETED_INVOKATION ]
and
.I op_api_out
indicated that the asynchronous operation succeeded and depending on the
definition of the XFTAM function that initiated the asynchronous operation.
.RS
.PP
For example, if the function
.BR ft_frattributes (3)
is invoked in asynchronous mode, this output parameter is used to return a
pointer to the resulting FTAM-Attributes object returned by the read
attributes operation.
.RE
.TP
.BI api_out " (Private Object (API-Output-Parameters))
This parameter is always returned and is a handle for a private object of
class API-Output-Parameters.  It returns API-specific output parameters for
this function call.

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Only source compatibility is attempted.  Binary compatibility will fail due to
the lack of published and standard symbolic constants.  Any binary
compatibility experienced is a bug and will be removed in the next release.
