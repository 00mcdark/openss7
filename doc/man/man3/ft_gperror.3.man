.HP
.B FT_return_code ft_gperror(
.br
.BI "OM_private_object " api_out_in ,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR ft_gperror ()
function translates the result of a previous call to an XFTAM API function
into a pair of printable strings, corresponding to the Return-Code and
Vendor-Code attributes of the API-Output-Parameters object class.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.BI api_out_in " (Private Object (API-Output-Parameters))
This mandatory parameter is a handle for an object of class
API-Output-Parameters that contains the API output parameters for a previous
another function call for which the printable errors strings are required.
.TP
.BI return_string " (OM_String(*))
A text string in the natural language of the current locale that represents
the Return-Code attribute of the \fIapi_out_in\fP parameter.  This is the
XFTAM-specified error code and is always returned.  The resulting string is
formatted for printing as a self-contained unit (for example, in an English
language locale, it includes a terminating newline character).  The user must
pass a pointer to a location of type \fBOM_string *\fP.  If the pointer in the
referenced location is \fBNULL\fP,
.BR ft_gperror ()
will allocate storage for the string and return a pointer to it into the
referenced location.  Otherwise, the pointer in the referenced location must
point to at least 256 octets of storage, the string will be stored in the
locations pointed to.
.TP
.BI vendor_string " (OM_String (*))
A text string in the natural language of the current locale that represents
the Vendor-Code attribute of the \fiapi_out_in\fP parameter.  This is an
optional implementation-specific error code and is not returned if the
\fIapi_out_in\fP parameter did not contain an equivalent code.  The resulting
string is formatted for printing as a self-contained unit (for example, in an
English language locale, it includes a terminating newline character).  The
comments regarding allocation of storage for the \fIreturn_string\fP return
parameter also apply to this parameter.  If no vendor string is available, the
returned string will be zero-length (if the user supplies the storage), or the
returned pointer will be NULL (if the allocation of storage is left to
.BR ft_gperror ()).
.TP
.BI api_out " (Private Object (API-Output-Parameters))
This parameter is always returned and is a handle for a private object of
class API-Output-Parameters.  It returns API-specific output parameters for
this function call.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

.BR ft_gperror ()
is compatible with XFTAM

and implementations based on XFTAM, such as
.IR "Solstice OSI 9.0" ,
.IR "HP-UX OTS/9000" ,
.IR "AIX OSI/6000" ,
.IR "SVR 4.2 ONP" ,
with the following portability considerations:

Only source compatibility is attempted.  Binary compatibility will fail due to
the lack of published and standard symbolic constants.  Any binary
compatibility experienced is a bug and will be removed in the next release.
