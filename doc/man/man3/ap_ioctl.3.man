.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function controls the generation of software interrupts for the XAP instance identified by
.IR fd .
.PP
Software interrupt is an asynchronous mechanism that can be used to inform an application of pending
events or state changes for a service that it is using. An XAP implementation may use such a mechanism
to inform the XAP user about incoming events such as a primitive available to be received, or outgoing
events such as a flow control restriction being lifted. This mechanism is complementary to the
.BR ap_poll (3)
function which provides synchronous notification of such events.
.PP
Support for software interrupt and the mechanism by which such an interrupt is signalled to the XAP
user is a feature of the operating system platform on which the XAP implementation runs.  XAP does not
define a software interrupt interface mechanism itself. Further, support for the function provided by
.BR ap_ioctl ()
is not a mandatory part of XAP and if not available,
.BR ap_ioctl ()
returns
.RB [ AP_NOT_SUPPORTED ].
Therefore a portable application should not rely on provision of this mechanism.
.PP
If the user requires software interrupts to be generated when a data event occurs, then
.BR ap_ioctl ()
should be called with a
.I request
parameter of
.BR AP_SETPOLL .
The
.I l
member of the
.B ap_val_t
.I argument
parameter is a bitmask used to indicate which events should generate a software interrupt. All XAP
Library implementations recognise the following events:
.TP \w'\fBAP_POLLWRBAND\fR\(em'u
.B AP_POLLRDNORM
Data (for example, an XAP Library primitive or user data associated with an XAP Library primitive) has
arrived on the normal data flow and is available to be read.
.sp
Normal (band 0) data may be read from \fIfd\fP without blocking.  For \fISTREAMS\fP(4) special
files, this event occurs when a \fBM_PROTO\fP(9) or \fBM_DATA\fP(9) message (in band zero(0))
arrives at the Stream head and is generated even when the data available is of zero length.  See
\fBgetmsg\fP(2s).
.TP
.B AP_POLLRDBAND
Data has arrived outside the normal data flow and is available to be read. In implementations that do
not support multiple data bands, this event will result in the same action as the
.B AP_POLLRDNORM
event.
.sp
Priority (band > 0) data may be read from \fIfd\fP without blocking.  For \fISTREAMS\fP(4) special
files, this event occurs when a \fBM_PROTO\fP(9) or \fBM_DATA\fP(9) message (in a band greater than
zero) arrives at the Stream head and is generated even when the data available is of zero length.
See \fBgetpmsg\fP(2s).
.TP
.B AP_POLLIN
Data has arrived (on either band) and is available to be read.
.sp
Nomral priority data may be read from \fIfd\fP without blocking.  For \fISTREAMS\fP(4) special
files, this event occurs when a \fBM_PROTO\fP(9) or \fBM_DATA\fP(9) message (in any band) arrives at
the Stream head and is generated even when the data available is of zero length.  See
\fBgetmsg\fP(2s).
.TP
.B AP_POLLOUT
Data can be sent on the normal priority band.
.sp
Normal (band 0) data may be written to \fIfd\fP without blocking.  For \fISTREAMS\fP(4) special
files, this even occurs when band zero high water makr thresholds have not been exceeded, or when
band zero becomes back-enabled (falls below the low water mark threshold).
.TP
.B AP_POLLWRNORM
The same as AP_POLLOUT.
.TP
.B AP_POLLWRBAND
Out-of-band data can be sent. This event will be treated as
.B AP_POLLOUT
in implementations that do not support multiple data bands.
.sp
Priority (band > 0) data may be written to \fIfd\fP without blocking.  For \fISTREAMS\fP(4) special
files, this event occurs when any non-zero band high water mark thresholds have not been exceeded,
or when any non-zero band becomes back-enabled (falls below the low water makr threshold).  This
event only occurs for bands that have been written to at least once.
.PP
Support for events other than those listed above is optional. Users interested in developing
applications that are portable across different XAP Library implementations should keep this caveat in
mind.
.PP
If the user requires software interrupts to be disabled then
.BR ap_ioctl ()
should be called with a
.I request
parameter of
.BR AP_SETPOLL
and the
.I l
member of the
.B ap_val_t
.I argument
value as 0.
.PP
If the user wishes to obtain the current settings of the software interrupts bitmask then
.BR ap_ioctl ()
should be called with a
.I request
parameter of
.BR AP_GETPOLL .
The
.I v
member of the
.B ap_val_t
.I argument
must point to a location where the current setting of the bitmask is to be written by
.BR ap_ioctl ().
.PP
.I aperrno_p
must be set to point to a location which will be used to carry an error code back to the user.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero
.RB ( 0 )
is returned. Otherwise, a value of
minus one
.RB ( -1 )
is returned and the location pointed to by
.I aperrno_p
is set to indicate the error.

.SH ERRORS
.TP \w'[\fBAP_NOT_SUPPORTED\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ AP_BADF ]
The
.I fd
paramter does not identify an XAP instance.
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOT_SUPPORTED ]
.BR ap_ioctl ()
operation is not supported by this implementation of XAP.
.PP
In addition, operating system class errors are reported.
.TP \w'[\fBAP_NOT_SUPPORTED\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EFAULT ]
\fIargument.v\fP points outside the caller's valid address space.  Normally
the calling process is also sent a fatal {\fISIGSEGV\fP} signal.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
\fIfd\fP,  \fIrequest\fP, \fIargument\fP, or a member of \fIargument\fP, or a
member of a structure pointed to by \fIargument\fP is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
\fIrequest\fP was \fBAP_GETPOLL\fP and the process is not registered to
receive a {\fISIGPOLL\fP} or {\fISIGURG\fP} signal.
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
\fIfd\fP refers to a Stream that is closing.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
\fIfd\fP refers to a Stream that has received a hangup, that is, a
\fBM_HANGUP\fP(9) message was received by the Stream head.
.TP
.RB [ EPIPE ]
\fIfd\fP referes to a \fISTREAMS\fP-based pipe and the other end of the pipe
is closed.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
\fIfd\fP refers to a Stream that is linked under a multiplexing driver.  If a
Stream is linked under a multiplexing driver, all \fBioctl\fP(2s) commands
other than \fBI_UNLINK\fP(7) or \fBI_PUNLINK\fP(7) will return [\fBEINVAL\fP].
.TP
.RB [ ERESTARTSYS ]
A signal was received (or generated by the call) before the operation could
begin.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
A signal was received before the operation could complete.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
A message block could not be allocated during the operation and the operation
is not permitted to block.  Under some circumstances, an \fBioctl\fP(2s)
command will block awaiting the availability of message blocks, regardless of
the setting of \fBO_NDELAY\fP or \fBO_NONBLOCK\fP.
.PP
Any error delivered to the Stream head in an \fBM_ERROR\fP(9) message can be
returned.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT-LEVEL
.PP
.BR ap_ioctl ()
is MT-safe.  Note that
.BR ap_ioctl ()
is a thread cancellation point, as is the underlying \fBioctl\fP(2s) system
call.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The OpenSS7 XAP library also supports the following:
.TP \w'\fBAP_POLLWRBAND\fR\(em'u
.B AP_POLLPRI
High-priority data may be read from \fIfd\fP without blocking.  For
\fISTREAMS\fP(4) special files, this event occurs when an \fBM_PCPROTO\fP(9)
and \fBM_DATA\fP(9) message arrives at the Stream head and is generated even
when the data available is of zero length.
.TP
.B AP_POLLMSG
A pending signal has occured on the file.  For \fISTREAMS\fP(4) special files,
this event occurs when an \fBM_SIG\fP(9) message arrives at the Stream head.
.TP
.B AP_POLLERR
An error has occured on the file.  For \fISTREAMS\fP(4) special fiels, this
event occurs when an \fBM_ERROR\fP(9) message arrives at the Stream head.
.TP
.B AP_POLLHUP
A hangup has occured on the file.  For \fISTREAMS\fP(4) special files, this
event occurs when an \fBM_HANGUP\fP(9) message arrives at the Stream head or
the Stream is closing.  A Stream cannot be writable while this event is in
force.
.TP
.B AP_POLLURG
A modifier to \fBAP_POLLRDBAND\fP to generate a {\fISIGURG\fP} signal instead of a
{\fISIGPOLL\fP} signal.
.PP
Note that setting signals in this fashion does not survive a
.BR fork (2)
system call.  Each process must regsister for signals to receive them.
Signals are not inherited from the parent process even if the file descriptor
remains open in the child process.

This function is not supported by the APLI library.  For OpenSS7 APLI library
applications, \fBI_SETSIG\fP(7) and \fBI_GETSIG\fP(7) should be used directly.
See \fBstreamio\fP(7).
.IP \(em
For XAP library applications, \fBap_ioctl\fP() should be used instead of the
\fISTREAMS\fP \fBI_SETSIG\fP(7) and \fBI_GETSIG\fP(7) STREAMS input-output
controls.
.IP \(em
The OpenSS7 XAP library provides \fBAP_POLLPRI\fP, \fBAP_POLLMSG\fP,
\fBAP_POLLERR\fP, \fBAP_POLLHUP\fP and \fBAP_POLLURG\fP in the obvious manner
to support \fISTREAMS\fR(4) standard events described in \fII_SETSIG\fP(7).
This is a rather obvious approach to these extensions and should be compatible
with most \fISTREAMS\fP-based APLI and XAP implementations.
.IP \(em
Only source compatibility is attempted.
Binary compatibility is not
attempted: any exhibited binary compatibility is coincidental and is scheduled
to be removed on the next release.
