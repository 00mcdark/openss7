.B #include <npiapi.h>
.HP
\fBint npi_connect\fP(\fBint\fP \fIfd\fP);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the file descriptor for the Stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B npi_connect
is a NPI API Library
.[
npiapi
.]
subroutine.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B npi_connect
function, include
.RB < sys/npi.h >
and
.RB < npiapi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -lnpiapi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B npi_connect
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B npi_connect
is fully thread-safe.
What is described as global variables are in fact thread-specific data when
linked with
.BR libpthread .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B npi_connect
is successful, it returns zero (0) or a positive integer value.
When
.B npi_connect
fails, it returns a negative integer value (-1).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B npi_connect
fails, it returns a negative integer value (-1).
.B npi_connect
may fail when:
.TP \w'[\fBENOMEM\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ EBADF ]
the file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
supplied does not correspond to a valid NPI Stream open for reading and
writing.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
one of the arguments supplied was invalid.
.PP
In addition, any of the error numbers returned by
.BR putmsg (2s),
.BR getmsg (2s),
.BR open (2s),
.BR close (2s),
.BR ioctl (2s)
may also be returned by
.BR npi_connect .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B npi_connect
is a
.IR GCOM -specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor smbol,
.BR _GCOM_SOURCE ,
before including the
.RB < sys/npi.h >
header file, to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations
necessary for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < npiapi.h >
header file
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.
.\"
.\"
.SH FILES
.PP

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B npi_connect
is compatible with the
.I GCOM
NPI API Library,
.[
npiapi
.]
and system providing an interface equialent to the
.I GCOM
NPI API Library,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B NPI API Library
functions are
.IR GCOM -specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR GCOM
software to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
NPI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the NPI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
