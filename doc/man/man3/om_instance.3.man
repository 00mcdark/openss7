.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR om_instance ()
function determine whether a service-generated public or private object, the
subject is an instance of a particular class or any of its subclasses.
.TP
.B Note:
The client can determine an object's class,
.IR C ,
by simply inspecting the object (using programming language constructs if the
object is public, or the
.BR om_get (3)
function if it is private).  The utility of the present function is that it
reveals that an object is an instance of the specified class, even if
.I C
is a subclass of that class.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, the zero value of
.RB [ OM_SUCCESS ]
is returned. Otherwise, a non-zero diagnostic error value is returned.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR om_instance ()
fails, it returns a non-zero error code, as follows:
.TP
.RB [ OM_FUNCTION_INTERRUPTED ]
The function was aborted by an external force (for example, a keystroke,
designated for this purpose, at a user interface).
.TP
.RB [ OM_MEMORY_INSUFFICIENT ]
The service cannot allocate the main memory it needs to complete the function.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NETWORK_ERROR ]
The service could not successfully employ the network upon which its
implementation depends.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NO_SUCH_CLASS ]
A purported class identifier is undefined.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NO_SUCH_OBJECT ]
A purported object is nonexistent or the purported handle is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NO_SUCH_SYNTAX ]
A purported syntax identifier is undefined.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NOT_THE_SERVICES ]
An object is client-generated, rather than service-generated or private.
.TP
.RB [ OM_PERMANENT_ERROR ]
The service encountered a permanent difficulty other than those denoted by
other return codes.
.TP
.RB [ OM_POINTER_INVALID ]
In the C inteface, an invalid pointer was supplied as a function argument or as
the receptacle for a function result.
.TP
.RB [ OM_SYSTEM_ERROR ]
The service could not successfully employ the operating system upon which its
implementation depends.
.TP
.RB [ OM_TEMPORARY_ERROR ]
The service encountered a temporary difficulty other than those denoted by
other return codes.
.PP
Other arguments passed to or returned by the function are unaffected.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

is compatible with

and implementations based on
XOM,
.[

with the following portability considerations:

Note that many add-on OSI packages for popular UNIX SVR 4.2 based releases
provided the XOM interface and the associated set of X/Open, IEEE and ISO
standard interfaces.

The function is source compatible only.  Binary compatibility was not
attempted.
