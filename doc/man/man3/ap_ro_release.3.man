.HP
.BI "ap_ro_release(int " fd ", unsigned long *" aperrno_p ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
This integer value refers to the descriptor returned from a previous
.BR ap_open (3)
call.  It identifies the liberary instance that supports the association.
.TP
.I aperrno_p
In case of failure,
.I aperrno_p
must be set to point to a location that will be used to carry an error code back to the user.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR ap_ro_release ()
function releases an instance of the XAP-ROSE user environment from an established application
association.
.PP
If this function returns success, the ROSE service provider has been disabled, and will no longer be
active when an application association is esablished.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
On success,
.BR ap_ro_release ()
returns zero (0).  When an error occurs, minus one (-1) is returned and the location pointed to by
.I aperrno_p
is set to indicate the error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR ap_ro_release ()
fails, it returns minus one (-1) and sets the location pointed to by
.I aperrno_p
to one of the following error codes:
.TP
.RB [ AP_NOT_SUPPORTED ]
The identified instance is not an XAP-ROSE instance - that is, the service provider selected in the
call to
.BR ap_open (3)
does not support a ROSE service provider, or the AP_ROSE_MODE flag has not been set in the
AP_MODE_SEL environment attribute.
.PP
In addition to these errors, any of the errors returned from the XAP Library may also be returned.

.BR aperrno (3).
