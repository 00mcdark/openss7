.TH PCAPNG_BREAKLOOP 3 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "PCAP-NG Library Calls"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B pcapng_breakloop
\- force a pcapng_dispatch() or pcapng_loop() call to return.
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <pcapng.h>
.HP 8
.BI "void pcapng_breakloop(pcap_t *" p );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I p
a PCAP-NG handle.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B pcapng_breakloop
signals to
.BR pcapng_dispatch (3)
or
.BR pcapng_loop (3)
that they are to return instead of looping by setting a flag.  These
functions will return with the number of packets processed so far, or
.B -2
when no packets have been processed, as flag is checked in loops reading
packets within
.B pcapng_dispatch (3)
and
.B pcapng_loop (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.B pcapng_breakloop
can be used simply from within a packet handling callback invoked by
.BR pcapng_dispatch (3)
or
.BR pcapng_loop (3).
For this use the dispatch or loop will return immediately upon checking the
flag set by
.B pcapng_breakloop
before processing of another packet occurs.
So, for example, the callback function, after processing the packet passed to
the callback, could check one or more conditions and determine that the loop
must be exited to process some more important event.  In this case, it could
call
.B pcapng_breakloop
to cause the caller to exit upon the callback function's return.
.PP
Another use of
.B pcapng_breakloop
is in response to a signal.  Upon receipt of a signal while the process is
currently involved in a
.BR pcapng_dispatch (3)
or
.BR pcapng_loop (3)
loop, the signal handler may use
.B pcapng_breakloop
to signal that the loop is to be exited.  When the loop exist, the main
thread of the process can perform other actions before reentering the loop.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B pcapng_breakloop
is trivially thread-safe.  It affects a
.B volatile
element in the main
.B pcapng_t
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.B pcapng_breakloop
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B pcapng_breakloop
always succeeds.

.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.B pcapng_breakloop
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B pcapng_breakloop
is compatible with
.BR pcap_breakloop (3),
as it is used in some instances to implement the function.
.B pcapng_breakloop
adds thread-safety to the
.BR pcap_breakloop (3)
call by appropriately wrapping calls to the function.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
.B pcapng_breakloop
conforms to the operation of the
.BR pcap_breakloop (3)
function from
.BR libpcap .
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
.B pcapng_breakloop
first appeared in PCAP-NG 1.0.
.BR pcap_breakloop (3)
appeared in
.BR libpcap.
