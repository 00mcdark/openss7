.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dlpi_recv
is a DLPI Library
.[
soldoc11
.]
subroutine.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B dlpi_recv
function, include
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
and
.RB < dlpi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -ldlpi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B dlpi_recv
function or include the
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.a
static library object as an target of the linking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B dlpi_recv
is fully thread-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B dlpi_recv
is successful, it returns zero (0) or a positive integer value.
When
.B dlpi_recv
fails, it returns a negative integer value (-1).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B dlpi_recv
fails, it returns a negative integer value (-1).
.B dlpi_recv
may fail when:
.TP \w'[\fBENOMEM\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ EBADF ]
the file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
supplied does not correspond to a valid DLPI Stream open for reading and
writing.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
one of the arguments supplied was invalid.
.PP
In addition, any of the error numbers returned by
.BR putmsg (2s),
.BR getmsg (2s),
.BR open (2s),
.BR close (2s),
.BR ioctl (2s)
may also be returned by
.BR dlpi_recv .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B dlpi_recv
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor symbol,
.BR _SUN_SOURCE ,
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file, to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations
necessary for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < dlpi.h >
header file
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.
.\"
.\"
.SH FILES
.PP
.TP
.B @includedir@/@PACKAGE@/sys/dlpi.h
The DLPI header file.
.TP
.B @includedir@/@PACKAGE@/dlpi.h
The DLPI Library header file.
.TP
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.a
The static library containing the
.BR dlpi_recv
function.
.TP
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.so
The shared object library containing the
.BR dlpi_recv
function.

.B dlpi_recv
has no known bugs.

.SH SEE ALSO
.PP
.BR dlpi (7),
.BR dlpi (3),

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B dlpi_recv
is compatible with the
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
.[
soldoc11
.]
and systems providing an interface equivalent to
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B DLPI Library
functions are
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
applications programs, drivers and modules to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the DLPI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
.PP
For further compatibility information, see
.BR dlpi (3),
.BR dlpi (7),
.IR STREAMS (9).
