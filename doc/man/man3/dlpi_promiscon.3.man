.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dlpi_promiscon
is a DLPI Library
.[
soldoc11
.]
subroutine that requests that the DLS provider place the DLPI Stream into
promiscuous mode.  Promiscuous mode is where the DLPI Stream receives all
messages received by the interface for the requested promiscuous level.
.PP
The DLS user uses \fBdlpi_enabmulti\fP(3) and \fPdlpi_promiscon\fP to define a
set of enabled physical and SAP address components on a per DLPI Stream basis.
It is invalid for a DLS provider to ever send upstream a data message that
the DLS user on that Stream has not requested.  The burden is on the provider to
enforce by any meahc that it chooses, the isolation of SAP and physical address
space effects on a per-Stream basis.
.PP
When the DLS user requests promiscuous mode at the physical level
(\fB\)DL_PROMISC_PHYS\fP), the DLS user receives a copy of every packet on the
wire for all SAPs.  This has the same effect (for the local Stream) as though
the DLS user could set a wildcard physical address.
.PP
When the DLS user requests promiscuous mode at the SAP level
(\fB\)DL_PROMISC_SAP\fP), the DLS user receives a copy of every packet on the
wire directed to that user (physical address, broadcast address or enabled
multicast address) that matches any SAP for that interface.  This has the same
effect as though the DLS user could bind to a wildcard SAP.
.PP
When the DLS user requests promiscous mode for all multicast adddresses
(\fB\)DL_PROMISC_MULTI\fP), the DLS user receives all packets on the wire that
have either a multicast or group destination address, including broadcast
addresses.  This has the same effect as though the DLS user could enable a
wildcard multicast address.

.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B dlpi_promiscon
function, include
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
and
.RB < dlpi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -ldlpi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B dlpi_promiscon
function or include the
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.a
static library object as an target of the linking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B dlpi_promiscon
is fully thread-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B dlpi_promiscon
is successful, it returns \fBDLPI_SUCCESS\fP.
When
.B dlpi_promiscon
fails, it returns a DLPI or DLPI Library error code.  When the DLPI error code
is \fBDL_SYSERR\fP, the error is contained in the \fIerrno\fP(3) global
variable.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B dlpi_promiscon
fails, it returns a DLPI, DLPI Library or system error code.
.B dlpi_promiscon
may fail when:
.PP
The following DLPI Library errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDL_NOTSUPPORTED\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ DLPI_EINHANDLE ]
The DLPI handle, \fIdh\fP, is not a valid data link handle.
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ DLPI_EINVAL ]
The \fIlevel\fP argument is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ DLPI_EBADMSG ]
Received a bad or unexpected DLPI message.
.TP
.RB [ DLPI_ETIMEDOUT ]
The operation timed out awaiting an acknowledgement.
.PD
.PP
The following DLPI errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDL_NOTSUPPORTED\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ DL_NOTSUPPORTED ]
The primitive is known, but not supported by the DLS provider.
.PD 0
.\".TP
.\".RB [ DL_OUTSTATE ]
.\"The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ DL_UNSUPPORTED ]
Requested service is not supplied by the provider.
.TP
.RB [ DL_SYSERR ]
A system error occurred and the \fBLinux\fP system error code is in the
\fIerrno\fP(3) global variable.
.PD
.PP
The following \fBLinux\fP system errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDL_NOTSUPPORTED\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ EPERM ]
Fine-grained permission for the request is incorrect.
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
Insufficient memory was immediately available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
Insufficient buffers were immediately available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
Insufficient \fISTREAMS\fP resources were available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
A temporary failure occured and the DLS user should reissue the request.
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
The control information in the request has already been subjected to the
control request or a transient condition prevented the request.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
On of the parameters of the requst for which there is no prescribed error code
has an invalid value.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTSUP ]
The request is recognized by not supported.
.TP
.RB [ ENOLINK ]
The interface, Physical Point of Attachment, or underlying driver or device, is
not connected.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
Invalid device.  The interface, Physical Point of Attachment, or underlying
driver or device is no longer installed on the system.
.PD
.PP
In addition, any of the error numbers returned by
.BR putmsg (2s)
or
.BR getmsg (2s)
may also be returned in \fIerrno\fP(3) when
.B dlpi_promiscon
returns \fBDL_SYSERR\fP.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B dlpi_promiscon
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor symbol,
.BR _SUN_SOURCE ,
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file, to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations
necessary for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < dlpi.h >
header file
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B dlpi_promiscon
is compatible with the
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
.[
soldoc11
.]
and systems providing an interface equivalent to
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B DLPI Library
functions are
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
applications programs, drivers and modules to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the DLPI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
