.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dlpi_enabnotify
is a DLPI Library
.[
soldoc11
.]
subroutine requests that the DLS provider register the notifications specified
in \fInotes\fP and call back the specified callback function, \fIfuncp\fP with
the DLPI handle, \fIdh\fP, notification information, and client argument,
\fIarg\fP, when an event occurs for which notification is registered.
.PP
When successful, \fBdlpi_enabnotify\fP will return a handle to the area pointed
to by \fIidp\fP that may be used in a subsequent call to \fBdlpi_disabnotify\fP
to de-register the notification.
Note that \fBdlpi_notifyid_t\fP is opaque to the DLPI library user, but can be
treated as a \fB(void *)\fP type.
.PP
The callback function, \fIfuncp\fP, is called with the DLPI handle, \fIdh\fP,
the client-supplied argument, \fIarg\fP, and a pointer to a
\fBdlpi_notifyinfo_t\fP structure describing each notification.  The callback
function will be invoked until the DLPI Stream is closed, or the
\fBdlpi_disabnotify\fP(3) function is invoked to disable the callback.
.PP
Multiple callback functions can be registered for a given notification on a DLPI
Stream.  Callback functions can be registered and deregistered in any order.
When invoked due to the occurence of an event, the most recently registered
callback function will be invoked first.

.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B dlpi_enabnotify
function, include
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
and
.RB < dlpi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -ldlpi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B dlpi_enabnotify
function or include the
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.a
static library object as an target of the linking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B dlpi_enabnotify
is fully thread-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B dlpi_enabnotify
is successful, it returns \fBDLPI_SUCCESS\fP, and the handle for the
notification in the area pointed to by \fIidp\fP.
When
.B dlpi_enabnotify
fails, it returns a DLPI or DLPI Library error code.  When the DLPI error code
is \fBDL_SYSERR\fP, the error is contained in the \fIerrno\fP(3) global
variable.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B dlpi_enabnotify
fails, it returns a DLPI, DLPI Library or system error code.
.B dlpi_enabnotify
may fail when:

The control information in the request has already been subjected to the
control request or a transient condition prevented the request.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
On of the parameters of the requst for which there is no prescribed error code
has an invalid value.

not connected.

In addition, any of the error numbers returned by

may also be returned in \fIerrno\fP(3) when
.B dlpi_enabnotify
returns \fBDL_SYSERR\fP.

.SH NOTICES
.PP

is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor symbol,

before including the

header file, to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations
necessary for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B dlpi_enabnotify
is compatible with the
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
.[
soldoc11
.]
and systems providing an interface equivalent to
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The
.B dlpi_enabnotify
function relies upon support for the
.BR DL_NOTIFY_REQ (7)
primitive, which is not part of the DLPI standard.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
It should, therefore, not be used by portable DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
does not document values of the \fInotes\fP argument:
.BR DL_NOTE_AGGR_AVAIL ,
.BR DL_NOTE_AGGR_UNAVAIL ,
.B DL_NOTE_FASTPATH_FLUSH
and
.BR DL_NOTE_CAPAB_RENEG .
These values should not be used by even
.IR Solaris \(rg
programs.  Link aggregation and IP fast path are not necessarily supported by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
drivers, modules, libraries and programs.
.IP \(em
.B DLPI Library
functions are
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
applications programs, drivers and modules to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the DLPI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
