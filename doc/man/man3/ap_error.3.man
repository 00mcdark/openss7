.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function returns a pointer to a message that describes the error
indicated by
.IR aperrno .
The message is in the natural language of the currently defined
.BR LOCALE .
The pointer will point to
.B NULL
if no such message is available under the currently defined
.BR LOCALE .
For English language locales, the message will be one of the messages listed
under
.RB \(lq "ERROR STRINGS" ,\(rq
below.  The message pointer points to an internal buffer area.  If the caller
wishes to retain the message text, before calling
.BR ap_error ()
again, then the text should be copied to some private storage.
.PP
All error codes that are not XAP errors and thus do not map to error strings
will return a generic error string.
