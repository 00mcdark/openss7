.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function frees memory allocated for structures used to convey the values of APLI environment
attributes, or
.B ap_cdata_t
structures that are associated with APLI primitives.  Many of these structures have pointers to
variables that are allocated dynamically.  If these structures are not freed, the memory they occupy
will continue to grow throughout the life of the APLI instance.  A typical use of this function is
to free memory allocated for the value of an environment attribute following an
.BR ap_get_env (3)
invocation.  Note that
.BR ap_free (3)
cannot be used to free user-allocated memory.
.PP
The argument,
.IR kind ,
identifies the kind of structure that is to be freed.  Legal values for this argument are:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
The names of APLI environment attributes listed in
.BR ap_env (3)
(for example
.BR AP_INIT_TOKENS ).
.IP \(bu
The names of APLI service primitives.
.IP \(bu
The names of types associated with either APLI environment attributes or service primitives, in
capital letters.
.PP
The argument,
.IR val ,
is a pointer to a structure of the type indicated by
.IR kind .
When releasing memory,
.BR ap_free ()
follows and frees all internal pointers.  The top level structure (the structure pointed to by
.IR val )
is not freed.  If the specified structure does not contain any pointers,
.BR ap_free ()
has no effect.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success, a value of zero (0) is returned; otherwise, minus one (-1) is returned and
.BR ap_errno (3)
is set to indicate the error.  The corresponding error message is returned by calling the
.BR ap_error (3)
function.

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
The following example shows how memory allocated to the
.B AP_CDL
environment attribute by
.BR ap_get_env ()
can be released by calling
.BR ap_free ()
with
.I kind
set to
.B AP_CDL
(or
.BR AP_CDL_T )
and
.I val
pointer to the relevant
.BR ap_cdl_t
structure.
