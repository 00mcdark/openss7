.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Name-to-Address translation shared objects are those listed in the name-to-address libraries member,
.IR nc_lookup ,
of the
.BR netconfig (5)
structure.
These n2a libraries are libraries that can be opened by the dynamic linker, see
.BR dlopen (3),
and which provide the following symbols (with the function prototypes listed under
.RI \(lq SYNOPSIS \(rq,
above, and declared in
.RB < netdir.h >):
.TP
.B _netdir_getbyname
Translate the supplied host and service name to a list of transport specific addresses.
.IP ""
When the transport supports transport-independent RPC, the service name
.RI \(lq rpcbind \(rq
should always be supported.
.IP ""
If the service name member,
.IR h_serv ,
of the
.B nd_hostserv
structure is
.BR NULL ,
the host name member,
.IR h_name ,
of the
.B nd_hostserv
structure should still be used if present and a host name only derived list of addresses should be
returned.
.IP ""
The following special host names from
.RB < netdir.h >
should be recognized:
.RS
.TP \w'\fBHOST_SELF_CONNECT\fR\(em'u
.B HOST_SELF
Local host name.
.PD 0
.TP
.B HOST_ANY
Any host name.
.TP
.B HOST_BROADCAST
All addresses accessible by transport.
.TP
.B HOST_SELF_CONNECT
Address for connecting to the local host.
.TP
.B HOST_SELF_BIND
Bind to one's self.
.TP
.B HOST_ALLNODES
All nodes (broadcast or rpcbind broadcast).
.TP
.B HOST_RPCNODES
All RPC nodes (multicast or rpcbind multicast).
.PD
.RE
.TP
.B _netdir_getbyaddr
Translate the transport specific address to a list of host and service name tuples.
.TP
.B _netdir_options
Perform options management on the transport.
.TP
.B _taddr2uaddr
Translate a transport specific address to a character string representation (universal address).
.TP
.B _uaddr2taddr
Translate a universal address (character string) to a transport specific address.
.PP
The order in which the name-to-address translation libraries are accessed is dependent upon the
order of the libraries in the
.I nc_lookup
member of the
.BR netconfig (5)
structure for the specific transport specified by
.IR tp .
The corresponding symbol in each name-to-address is invoked until a success has been achieved, a
fatal error occurs (see
.RI \(lq ERRORS \(rq,
below), or the list is exhausted without success.
.\"
.\"
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
General rules for implementation of the name-to-address translation procedures are as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Shared object procedures are permitted to use
.BR malloc (3),
.BR xti (3),
and low-level RPM routines.
.BR malloc (3)
is the only permitted way to allocate structures.
.IP \(bu
Procedures must not recurse on functions in the
.BR libxnsl (3)
library, but may call naming functions in the
.B Linux
.BR libnsl.so
library.
.IP \(bu
The results passed back from procedures cannot be static.  Any structures passed back must by
dynamically allocated using
.BR malloc (3)
(including universal address strings).
The caller is ultimately responsible for freeing these data structures using
.BR netdir_free (3),
for
.BR netbuf (3),
.BR nd_addrlist ,
.BR nd_hostserv ,
and
.BR nd_hostservlist
structures.  Universal address strings must be freed with
.BR free (3).
.IP \(bu
.BR _netdir_getbyname "(), " _netdir_getbyaddr "(), " _taddr2uaddr "() and " _uaddr2taddr ()
return
.B NULL
on error.
.BR _netdir_options ()
returns non-zero
on error.
.IP \(bu
Procedures must assign error values to the global
.BR _nderror (3)
thread-specific variable.  All fatal errors will cause lookup of subsequent shared object files to
terminate.  Non-fatal errors will cause the next shared object file to be called.  Fatal errors are
negative.  Non-fatal errors are positive.  Success is zero.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR _netdir_getbyname (),
.BR _netdir_getbyaddr (),
.BR _taddr2uaddr "() and "
.BR _uaddr2taddr (),
return a pointer to
.BR malloc (3)'ed
structure(s) or character string;
.BR _netdir_options ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 ).
On failure,
.BR _netdir_getbyname (),
.BR _netdir_getbyaddr (),
.BR _taddr2uaddr "() and "
.BR _uaddr2taddr (),
return
.BR NULL ;
.BR _netdir_options ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 ),
and all set
.IR _nderror (3)
to indicate the error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When a procedure fails, it returns
.BR NULL ,
or a non-zero value,
and sets
.BR _nderror (3)
to an appropriate error number as described below.
Negative error numbers are fatal.  Positive error numbers are considered warnings.
When the
.BR libxnsl (3)
library function detects a fatal error, it will not try additional name-to-address shared libraries
on the lookup list and will return an error to the caller; when it detects a non-fatal error, it
continues attempting to invoke the function on subsequent name-to-address shared libraries in the
lookup list.  The first success will cause the library function to return success to the caller.

Although the prototypes of the exported symbols follow the convention of
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
implementation differs and binary compatibility would only be coincidental.
.IP \(em
Name-to-address translation library names typically present on

systems are not necessarily provided.  Some libraries that provide similar translation services
might have different names.
.IP \(em
On
.IR UNIX \(rg
systems, these utility subroutines are normally part of the Network Services Library,
.BR libnsl ;
however,
.B Linux
already has a library of that name (which unfortunately is missing these components), and,
therefore,

renames the library to
