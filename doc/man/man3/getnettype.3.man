\- obtain X.25 network type for subnetwork identifier
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
X.25 Network Layer Interface (NLI).
.\"
.\"
.SH LIBRARY
.PP
X.25 Support Library,

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <netx25/x25_proto.h>
.br
.B #include <netx25/xnetdb.h>
.HP
.BI "int getnettype(unsigned char *" snid );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I snid
The subnetwork or link identifying unsigned character string.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B getnettype
determines the type of the subnetwork identified by the subnetwork string,
\fIsnid\fP, and returns the type of network to which the subnetwork string
corresponds.  To do this, it reads the \fBx25conf\fP(5) configuration file.
.PP
The network type can be one of the following symbolic constants defined in the
\fBxnetdb.h\fP header file:
.TP
.B LAN
the subnetwork identified by \fIsnid\fP is a local area network;
.TP
.B W80
the subnetwork identifier by \fIsnid\fP is a wide area network providing
X.25(1980);
.TP
.B W84
the subnetwork identifier by \fIsnid\fP is a wide area network providing
X.25(1984);
.TP
.B W88
the subnetwork identifier by \fIsnid\fP is a wide area network providing
X.25(1988).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.B getnettype
returns a value equal to one of the symbolic constants indicating the network
type associated with the provided subnetwork id.
Upon failure,
.B getnettype
returns a negative value.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B getnetype
fails when:
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
the supplied \fIsnid\fP was \fBNULL\fP or invalid.
.TP
.RB [ ENOENT ]
the configuration file, \fBx25conf\fP(5), does not exist.

Some implementations place header files in different locations:

includes the \fBxnetdb.h\fP header file from <\fBnetx25/xnetdb.h\fP>.
.I IRIS SX.25

includes the \fBx25_proto.h\fP header file from <\fBnetx25/x25_proto.h\fP>.
.I IRIS SX.25
.[

includes the \fBx25_proto.h\fP header file from <\fBsys/snet/x25_proto.h\fP>.
For
.I IRIS SX.25
.[

it is necessary to include the \fBx25_proto.h\fP header file.
For
.I Solstice X.25
.[
