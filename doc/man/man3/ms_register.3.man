.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to make long-term modification to various parameters held
by the MTS regarding the delivery of messages to the MS.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.IR session "\0\fBSession\fP(Object(Session))
Specifies the MS session over which this function is performed.
.TP
.IR register_argument "\0\fBRegister-Argument\fP(Object(Register-Argument))
Specifies how to modify (via the
.BR ms_register ()
function) various parameters held by the MTS regarding delivery of messages to
the MS.  These parameters include the following:
.RS
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B User-Name
.br
Specifies the OR-name of the MS (this corresponds to the OR-name of the UA), if
the user-name is to be changed.
.IP \(em
.B User-Address
.br
Specifies the OR-address of the MS (this corresponds to the OR-name of the UA),
if it is required by the MTS and if it is to be changed.
.IP \(em
.B Deliverable-Encoded-Information-Types
.br
Specifies the encoded-information-types that the MTS shall permit to appear in
messages delivered to the MS, if they are to be changed.  The MTS shall reject
as undeliverable any message for an MS for which the MS is not registered to
accept delivery of all of the encoded-information-types of the message.  Note
that the MS may register to receive the undefined encoded-information-type.
This argument,
.BR Deliverable-Encoded-Information-Types ,
also indicates the possible encoded-information-types to which implicit
conversion can be performed.
.IP \(em
.B Deliverable-Maximum-Content-Length
.br
Specifies the content-length, in octets, of the longest content message that
the MTS shall permit to appear in messages being delivered to the MS, if it is
to be changed.  The MTS shall reject as undeliverable any message for an MS for
which the MS is not registered to accept delivery of messages of its size.
.IP \(em
.B Default-Delivery-Controls
.br
Specifies default delivery controls that are registered using the
.BR ms_register ()
function.  The default delivery control arguments shall not admit messages
whose delivery are prohibited by the prevailing registered values of the
.B Deliverable-Encoded-Information-Types
argument, the
.B Deliverable-Content-Types
argument or the
.B Delivery-Maximum-Content-Length
argument.
.IP \(em
.B Delivery-Content-Types
.br
Specifies the content-types that the MTS shall permit to appear in messages
delivered to the MS, if they are to be changed.  The MTS shall reject as
undeliverable any message for an MS for which the MS is not registered to
accept delivery of all of the content-types of the message.  Note that the MS
may register to receive the
.B undefined
content-type.
.IP \(em
.B Labels-And-Redirections
.br
Specifies one or both of the following:
.RS
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
the OR-name of an alternate recipient to which messages are to be redirected,
if this is to be changed.
.IP \(em
the security-labels of the UA, if they are to be changed.

.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.BR Status "(Status)
Indicates whether the function succeeded or not, if use synchronously; or
whether the function has been initiated, if used asynchronously.
.TP
.IR invoke_id_return "\0\fBInvoke-ID\fP(Integer)
The invoke-ID of the asynchronous operation.
.\"

.SH ERRORS
.PP
This function can return a System-Error or one of the following Library-Errors:
bad-argument, bad-session, asynchrony-not-supported, feature-unavailable,
feature-not-negotiated, no-workspace, out-of-memory, miscellaneous,
too-many-operations.
.PP
The following Message Store errors may be returned:
register-rejected.
.PP
This function can return a Communications-Error.
