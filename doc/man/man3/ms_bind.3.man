.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.IR bind_argument "\0\fBBind-Argument\fP(Object(Bind-Argument))
Specifies information for establishing a session with the Message Store service
provider, together with details of the service required.  This comprises:
.RS
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B Initiator
.br
Specifies the OR-name of the initiator (i.e., the UA) of this session (or
association) with the MS.
.IP \(em
.B Initiator-Credentials
.br
Specifies the credentials of the initiator for authentication purposes.
.IP \(em
.B Security-Context
.br
Identifies the security context at chiwch the initiator proposes to operate.
.IP \(em
.B Fetch-Restrictions
.br
Specifies the restrictions on entries to be returned as result of a
.BR ms_fetch (3)
function.  These restrictions prevail until the
.BR ms_unbind (3)
function is invoked.
.IP \(em
.B MS-Configuration-Request
.br
If true, specifies the request to obtain information relating to which
auto-actions and optional attributes for which the MS provides support.  If
false, no such request is being made.

.SH RETURN
.PP
.TP
.IR status "\0\fBStatus\fR(Status)
Indicates whether the function succeeded or not.

On successful completion, contains one or more of the following:
.RS
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B Responder-Credentials
.br
Indicates the credentials of the MS.
.IP \(em
.B Available-Auto-Actions
.br

(not just those requested by the client), if the MS-Configuration-Request was
made for the
.BR ms_bind ()
function.
.IP \(em
.B Available-Attribute-Types
.br
Indicates the set of all optional MS attribute-types that are supported by the
MS, if the MS-Configuration-Request was made for the
.BR ms_bind ()
function.
.IP \(em
.B Alert-Indication
.br
Indicates an alert condition has occurred since the last successful
Alert-Indication.
.IP \(em
.B Content-Types-Supported
.br
