.SH NAME
.B ds_bind
\- open a session with the directory
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xds.h>
.HP
.BI "DS_status ds_bind(OM_object " session ", OM_workspace " workspace ", OM_private_object *" bound_session_return );
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
To allow automatic connection management,
.BR ds_bind ()
may or may not communicat with a DSA when it is called.  The actual formation of a communications
association may be deferred until the first directory operation is attempted, and then may or may
not persist for a period of time.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
.BR Session (Object(Session))
Specifies a particular directory service provider, together with other details of the service
required.  This argument may be either a public object or a private object.  The constant
.RB [ DS_DEFAULT_SESSION ]
may also be used as the value of this argument, causing a new session to be created with default
values for all its OM attributes.
.TP
.I workspace
.BR Workspace (Workspace)
Specifies the workspace (obtained from a call to
.BR ds_initialize (3))
which is to be associated with the session.  All functions resulting from directory operations using
this session will be returned as private objects in this workspace.  If the
.I session
argument is a private object, it must be a private object in this workspace.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESULTS
.PP
.TP
.I retval
.BR Status (Status)
Whether or not the function completed successfully.  This function can return the constant
.RB [ DS_INVALID_WORKSPACE ]
or
.RB [ DS_SUCCESS ].
.TP
.I bound_session_return
.BR Bound-Session (Object(Session))
Upon successful completion, contains an instance of a directory session that may be used as an
argument to other functions (for example,
.BR ds_read (3)).
This will be a new private object if the value of
.B Session
was
.B Default-Session
or a public object, otherwise it will be that supplied as an argument.  The function will supply
default values for any of the OM attributes that were not present in the
.B Session
instance supplied as an argument.  It will also set the value of the
.B File-Descriptor
OM attribute (the value will be
.B No-Valid-File-Descriptor
.RB [ DS_NO_VALID_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]
fi the functionality is not supported.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
This function can return a
.B System-Error
or one of the following
.B Library-Errors:
bad-session, miscellaneous, too-many-sessions.
.PP
The following
.B Directory-errors
may be returned by the functions: Security-Error, Service-Error.
.PP
This function can return a
.BR Communications-Error .
.PP
This function can return the error constant
.RB [ DS_INVALID_WORKSPACE ].
