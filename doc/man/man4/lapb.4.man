.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B LAPB
is an X.25 LAPB (SLP and MLP) driver.  This an a DLPI driver that can push
over or link a CDI stream.  CDI streams can be
.BR CD_HDLC " or " CD_LAN .
.PP
.B CD_HDLC
streams need to be raw packet streams.  This driver will use LAPB over these
streams as described in X.25 Clause 2.
.PP
.B CD_LAN
streams need to be raw packet streams with or without SNAP headers.  This
driver will use LLC2 over these streams as described under ISO/IEC 8881.

Some implementations bundle this module in with the OSI protocol suite rather
than the X.25 protocol suite.
.IP \(em
For portability, this module should always be used instead of using the NLI
interface directly.
