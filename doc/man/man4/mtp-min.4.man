.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B MTP-MIN
is an implementation of the Signalling System No. 7
.RB ( SS7 (4))
Message Transfer Part
.RB ( MTP )
defined in
.I ITU-T Recommendation Q.710.
.[
q710
.]
but also supports a subset of ANSI,
.[
ansi t1.111
.]
ETSI
.[
mtpv1
.]
and simplified forms of other national variants.
.PP
Whereas
.BR mtp-mod (4)
is implemented as a pushable STREAMS module,
.B MTP-MIN
is implemented as a STREAMS multiplexing driver and, as such,
can accomodate a much wider range of applications (such as
multiple signalling point codes per signalling link).  Streams
providing the Signalling Link (SL) interface,
.BR sli (7),
are linked under the multiplexing driver using the
.BR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
STREAMS input-output controls and configured using MTP
input-output controls,
.BR mtp_ioctl (4).
This forms a complete MTP protocol layer for SS7.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Normally, in SS7, the complete MTP layer is used.  See,
.BR mtp (4).
.B MTP-MIN
has specific applications for minimalistic sinalling end point
(SEP) applications such as those found in F-link only operation
directly between signalling end points and more notably for
GSM-A interface.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B MTP-MIN
implements an
.BR M_CTL "(9) and " M_PCCTL (9)
based interface for both the upper and lower multiplex service
interfaces for efficiency.  The
.BR M_CTL "(9) and " M_PCCTL (9)
interface is designed to work identical to the
.BR M_PROTO "(9) and " M_PCPROTO (9)
interfaces provided by the Stream head, with the exception that,
because the Stream head cannot directly generate
.BR M_CTL "(9) or " M_PCCTL (9)
messages, they may be used for trusted inter-module messages
with greater efficiency.
.\"
.\"
.\".SH USAGE
.\".PP
.\"The
.\".B MTP-MIN
.\"multiplexing driver is not normally configured or accessed
.\"directly by user-level programs.  The
.\".B MTP-MIN
.\"multiplexing driver is used directly by some test and monitoring
.\"programs.  The following steps are taken to establish this
.\"minimal MTP facility:
.\".IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
.\"Open a control stream on the
.\".B MTP-MIN
.\"multiplexing driver (by opening, for example,
.\".BR /dev/streams/mtp-min/1 ).
.\".IP 2.
.\"Open and configure Signalling Link (SL) Streams for use by the
.\".B MTP-MIN
.\"multiplexing driver.  For each opened and configured Signalling
.\"Link (SL) Stream, link the Stream beneath the
.\".B MTP-MIN
.\"multiplexing driver using the
.\".BR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
.\"STREAMS input-output control.
.\".IP 3.
.\".IP 4.
.\".IP 5.
.\".IP 6.
.\".IP 7.
.\".IP 8.
.\".IP 9.
.\".IP 10.

.SH INTERFACES
.PP
At the upper multiplex,
.B MTP-MIN
provides the Message Transfer Part Interface (MTPI),
.[
mtpi revision @PACKAGE_VERSION@ draft @PACKAGE_RELEASE@
.]
.BR mtpi (7),
and the MTP input-output control interface,
.BR mtp_ioctl (4).
This interface directly models the MTP Primitives
.[
q701
.]
as STREAMS messages in a similar fashion to the NPI.
.[
npi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
.PP
At the lower multiplex,
.B MTP-MIN
provides the Signalling Link Interface (SLI),
.[
sli
.]
.BR sli (7).
This interface models the Signalling Link signals
.[
q703
.]
as STREAMS messages in a similar fashion to the DLPI.
.[

.SH IOCTLS
.PP
The
.B MTP-MIN
module response to Local Management Interface (LMI),
.BR lmi_ioctl (4),
input-output controls as interpreted for
.B MTP

.SH BUGS
.PP
.B MTP-MIN
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
SS7 application programming interfaces have not been subject to
standardization; however, where the OSI APIs are directly
applicable to protocol layers of the SS7 stacks, OpenSS7
provides OSI compatible interfaces.  Thus,
.B MTP-MIN
is largely compatible with implementations providing the NPI
interface
.[
npi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
for use with MTP,
.BR npi_mtp (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
SS7 does not have a traditional and standard implementation;
however, the implementation standards from the OSI are in may
cases directly applicable.
.\"
.\"
.SH VERSIONS
.PP
The MTP Interface (MTPI) is specific to the
.B OpenSS7 
SS7 Stack.
This is Version 2 of the interface.
The
.B MTP-MIN
multiplexing driver conforms to the MTPI Specification, Revision 0.9.2.
.[
mtpi revision @PACKAGE_VERSION@ draft @PACKAGE_RELEASE@
.]
.PP
The
.B MTP-MIN
multiplexing driver first appeared publicly in the
.B @PACKAGE@
release 0.9a.8.
.PP
This manual page was written for the
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
SS7 Stack.
