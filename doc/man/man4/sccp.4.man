.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B SCCP
is an implementation of the Signalling System No. 7
.BR SS7 (4)
Signalling Connection Control Part
.RB ( SCCP )
defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.711 and ANSI T1.112.
.B SCCP
provides reliable sequenced or unsequenced delivery of packets over a
connectionless or connection oriented transport between two
.B SCCP
endpoints.
.B SCCP
provides strong assurances that the data arrives in order on a stream, if
requested, and maintains sequencing of packets in the face of most network
failures.
.B SCCP
uses the services of the Message Transfer Part (see
.BR mtp (4))
or
MTP3 User Adaptation Layer (see
.BR m3ua (4))
to transfer packets.
.B SCCP
provides a global title translation service that maps global titles to
SCCP-SAP.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B SCCP
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR mtp (4)
or
.BR m3ua (4)
streams are linked under the
.B SCCP
multiplexing driver using the
.I I_LINK
or
.I I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide network services to SCCP.
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR sccp_ioctl (4).
.\"
.\"
.SS "Device Names"
.PP
.B SCCP
provides five stream type.  To select one of these stream types,
.I device
can be one of the following:
.\"
.\"
.TP
.IR /dev/sccp ", " /dev/sccp-sccpi
This device provides the
.B SCCP
protocol services interface using the N-primitives of the Signalling
Connection Control Part Interface described in
.BR sccpi (7).
.\"
.\"

.TP
.IR /dev/sccp-npi-cl ", " /dev/sccp-npi-co
This device provides the
.B SCCP
protocol service interface using the N-primitives of the Network Provider
Interface
.BR npi (7)
used for the Signalling Connection Control Part as described in
.BR sccp_npi (7).
The
.BR npi (7)
service interface is suitable for use with other OpenSS7 SS7 and SIGTRAN modules and drivers, such
as the
.BR sua-sg (4)
multiplexing driver.
.I /dev/sccp-npi-cl
provides a connectionless
.B N_CLNS
network service provider supporting protocol classes 0 and 1;
.I /dev/sccp-npi-co
provides a connection-oriented
.B N_CONS
network service provider supporting protocol classes 2 and 3.
.\"
.\"

.TP
.IR /dev/sccp-tpi-cl ", " /dev/sccp-tpi-co
This device provides the
.B SCCP
protocol service interface using the T-primitives of the Transport Provider
Interface
.BR tpi (7)
used for the Signalling Connection Control Part as described in
.BR sccp_tpi (7).
The
.BR tpi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with
the
.BR xnet (3)
or
.BR xti (3)
library and provides the
.B SCCP
interface using XTI as described in
.BR xti_sccp (3).
.I /dev/sccp-tpi-cl
provides a connectionless
.B T_CLTS
transport service provider supporting protocol classes 0 and 1;
.I /dev/sccp-tpi-co
provides a connection-oriented
.B T_COTS
transport service provider supporting protocol classes 2 and 3.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Socket Types"
.PP
.B SCCP
provides three socket types for use by the
.B sockets (3)
library
.B socket (3)
call.
.B SCCP
provides sockets in the protocol family
.B PF_SS7
using the protocol number
.BR SS7PROTO_SCCP .
The
.I socket_type
argument can be one of the following:
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B SOCK_DGRAM
Provides a connectionless datagram service without regard to order.
Message boundaries are preserved.  This is an
.B SCCP
protocol class 0 service provider.  This socket uses the underlying
.I /dev/sccp-tpi-cl
transport service provider.
.\"
.\"

.TP
.B SOCK_RDM
Provides a connectionless reliable datagram service without regard to order.
Message boundaries are preserved.  This is an
.B SCCP
protocol class 1 service provider.  This socket uses the underlying
.I /dev/sccp-tpi-co
transport service provider.
.\"
.\"

.TP
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET
Provides a connection-oriented reliable packet service with regard to order.
Message boundaries are preserved.  This is an
.B SCCP
protocol class 2 or 3 service provider.  This socket uses the underlying
.I /dev/sccp-tpi-co
transport service provider.

.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B SCCP
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver provides a number of device names that can be opened by user programs with the
.BR open (2s)
system call (see above under
.RI \(lq "Device Names" \(rq).
The
.BR open (2s)
system call returns a file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
that can be used ot make other system calls on the open
.B SCCP
Stream.
Each
.B SCCP
Stream provides a service primitive interface that implements the SCCP protocol 
The ssytem call,
.BR putpmsg (2s),
can be called to issue service primitives on the interface;
.BR getpmsg (2s),
to receive primitives.
.BR ioctl (2s)
as described in
.BR streamio (7)
and
.BR mtp_ioctl (7)
can be used to manage the Stream and the SCCP provider.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2)
and
.BR streamio (2)
.I I_STR
system calls on the
.IR sccp_stream ", " sccp_xtistr
or
.IR sccp_socket .
These management controls are documented in
.BR sccp_ioctl (4).
