.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B SDT-CD
is an implementation fo the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7)
.[
q700
.]
Signalling Terminal (SDT) as specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.702.
.[
q702
.]
.PP
.B SDT-CD
is implemented as a pushable
.IR STREAMS (4)
module.  The
.B SDT-CD
module can be pushed over Streams conforming to the Communication Device
Interface (CDI)
.[
cdi revision @PACKAGE_VERSION@ draft @PACKAGE_RELEASE@
.]
as described in
.BR cdi (7).
The
.B SDT-CD
module provides data terminal access to the HDLC frames from the
communications device provided by the
.BR cd_hdlc (4)
or
.BR cd_daed (4)
Stream below it.  The
.B SDT-CD
provides AERM, SUERM and EIM functions indirectly.  The upper interface
provided by the
.B SDT-CD
module is the Signalling Data Terminal Interface (SDTI)
.[
sdti
.]
as described in
.BR sdti (7).
.PP
.B SDT-CD
Streams, as any other SDTI Stream, can have
.BR sl (4)
modules pushed to provide a complete SS7 Signalling Link
.[
q703
.]
that can then be linked under the
.BR sl-mux (4)
link multiplexing driver for subsequent use by an
.BR mtp (4),
or
.BR m2ua (4)
driver using the
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide signalling link services to the Level 3 protocol.  This is normally
performed, as required, by the SS7 Confirmation Daemon,
.BR ss7confd (8).
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B SDT-CD
has been implemented as a pushable module to ease the development of SS7
Signalling Link drivers for various cards that already have raw HDLC support
in the Linux kernel.  The
.BR cd (4)
driver can be used to open a raw HDLC device that has an implementation within
the Linux kernel, and the
.BR SDT-CD
module is pushed to transform the
.B CD_HDLC
stream into an SS7 Signalling Terminal, and then push the
.BR sl (4)
module to provide a complete and compliant SS7 Signalling Link.
.PP
.B SDT-CD
implements the AERM/SUERM/EIM functions missing from the raw HDLC Stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B SDT-CD
modules are not normally pushed or acessed directly by user-level programs.
The
.B SDT-CD
module is used directly by some test and monitoring programs.  The
.B SDT-CD
module is not normally pushed by the configuration daemon either, but forms
part of an
.BR autopush (8)
specification for clone minor devices on the
.BR cd (4)
driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
The
.B SDT-CD
module responds to Local Management Interface (LMI),
.BR lmi_ioctl (4),
input-output controls as interpreted for
.BR sdti (7)
operation as described in
.BR sdt_ioctl (4).
