.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B DLC_TRACE
input-output control traces link station (LS) activity for short or long
activities.
.PP
To trace a link, line data and special events (such as station activation,
termination, and timeouts) can be logged in the generic trace facility for each
LS.  This funciton helps determine the cause of certain communications
attachment problems.  The GDLC user can select either short or long entries to
be traced.
.PP
Short entries consist of up to 80 bytes of line data, while long entries allow
full packets of data to be traced.
.PP
Tracing can be activated when an LS is strated, or it can be dynamically
acitvated or terminated at any time thereafter.
.PP
The argument to the
.B DLC_ADDR_FUNC_ADDR
input-output control is a pointer to a
.B dlc_trace_arg
structure, formatted as follows:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
struct dlc_trace_arg {
    uint32_t gdlc_sap_corr;
    uint32_t gdlc_ls_corr;
    uint32_t trace_chan;
    uint32_t flags;
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
The
.B dlc_trace_arg
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I gdlc_sap_corr
Specifies the generic data link control (GDLC) service access point (SAP)
correlator.  The correlator returned by GDLC when the SAP was enabled by the
user.  This correlator identifies the user SAP to the GDLC protocol process.
.TP
.I gdlc_ls_corr
Specifies the generic data link control (GDLC) link station (LS) correlator.
The correlator returned by the GDLC when the LS was started by the user.  This
correlator identifies the user LS to the GDLC protocol process.
.TP
.I trace_chan
Specifies the trace channel number obtained from the tcrestart() subroutine.
This field is only valid if the
.B DLC_TRCO
indicates is set to active.
.TP
.I flags
Sepcifies trace flags.  The following flags are supported:
.RS
.TP
.B DLC_TRCO
When set, indicates that the link trace is enabled; when clear, disabled.
.TP
.B DLC_TRCL
When set, indicates that the link trace entries are long (full packet); when
clear, short (80 bytes).
.RE

.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success, the input-output control returns zero (0).  Upon failure, the
input-output control returnes minus one (-1) and sets
.BR errno (3)
to an appropriate error code.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When the input-output control fails, it returns minus one (-1) and set the
.BR errno (3)
to an appropriate error code.  In addition to the reasons given in
.BR ioctl (2s),
this input-output control can fail because of the following:
.TP \w'[\fBEDEADLK\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
A parameter of the input-output control is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
A memory extent exceeds the callers valid address space.
.TP
.RB [ EPROTO ]
A rule of the interface protocol was violated.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
The operation could not be immediately processed.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
There were insufficient message buffers to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
There were insufficient STREAMS resources to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
There was insufficient memory to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ EDEADLK ]
A deadlock condition was detected and avoided.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that
.IR AIX \(rg
terminology for GDLC conflict with that of LLC
.[
iso/iec 8802-2 : 1998
.]
and LAPB.
.[
iso7776
.]
Under IEEE terminology, a link station is associated with the MAC entity or a
point-to-point data link endpoint, and one or more service access points (SAP)
are associated with the one link station.  LLC Type 2 supporting link stations
can have associated with them zero or more connections that represent a
connection between a local MAC address and a remote MAC address, a local SAP
and a remote SAP.  LAPB link stations can have associated with them 1
connection that represents a connection between the local and remote stations.
LAPD
.[
q921
.]
link stations can have associated with them one or more connections that
represent a connection associated with a local and remote SAP (TEI).
LAPF
.[
q922
.]
link stations can have associated with them one or more connections that
represent a connection associated with a local and remote SAP (DLCI).
.PP
.IR AIX \(rg
terminology in the GDLC documentation refers to this latter connection,
confusingly, as a link station (LS).
The
.IR AIX \(rg
GDLC service access point (SAP) is really a Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) and
DLSAP combination under the DLPI,
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
and the
.IR AIX \(rg
GDLC link station (LS) is really a connection identifier.
It may be helpful to think of a GDLC link station (LS) as an identifier of a
local and remote link station combination for a given DLSAP.
.PP
.B DLC_TRACE
is an
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
input-output control.
It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.B _AIX_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >,
.RB < sys/dlpi_ext.h >,
or
.RB < sys/dlpi_ioctl.h >
header files to expose the definitions, structures and declarations associated
with the input-output control.

The

.B DLC_TRACE

input-output control that is not part of the DLPI standard.

It should not be used by portable DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
.B DLC_TRACE

Binary compatibility is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced
may be removed from a future release.
