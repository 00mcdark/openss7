.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B M2UA
is an implementation of the SS7 MTP2 User Adaptation Layer (M2UA) defined in
RFC 3331.
.[
rfc3331
.]
.B M2UA
provides a backhaul of the services of the
.BR sl (4)
over an IP network using Stream Control Transmission Protocol,
.BR sctp (4),
as defined in RFC 2960.
.[
rfc2960
.]
.PP
.B M2UA
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR sl (4)
or
.BR sctp (4)
streams are linked under the
.B M2UA
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide transport or direct SL services
.[
q703
.]
.[
mtpv1
.]
.[
t1.111
.]
to
.BR M2UA .
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR m2ua_ioctl (4).
.PP
.B M2UA
provides the following stream types that are directly compatible with the
stream types provided by
.BR sl (4):
.TP
.I /dev/m2ua
This device provides the
.B SL
protocol service interface using the SL-primitives of the Signalling Link
Interface described in
.BR sli (7).
This interface is suitable for use with other SS7 modules and drivers.
.TP
.I /dev/m2ua-cdi
This device provides the
.B SL
protocol service interface using the CD-primitives of the Communications Data
Interface, described in
.BR cdi (7).
This interface is suitable for use with other modules and drivers expecting a
.BR cdi (7)
interface.
.TP
.I /dev/m2ua-dlpi
This device provides the
.B SL
protocol service interface using the DL-primitives of the Data Link Provider
Interface
.BR dlpi (7).
This interface is suitable for use with other modules and drivers expecting a
.BR dlpi (7)
interface.
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of mangaement IO controls using the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call on the
.BR m2ua_stream .
These management controls are documented in
.BR m2ua_ioctl (4).

driver is specific to the
.B OpenSS7
stack.  This is Version 3 of the interface.
