.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B CH
is an implementation of a local channel control for devices conforming
to the
.BR chi (7)
interface.
.B CH
provides for the control of the matrix and underlying interfaces and
communication facilities.
.PP
.B CH
Streams are normally implemented as
.IR STREAMS (4)
drivers.
The purpose of CH Streams are twofold:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
To provide raw data channel services from multiplex equipment or to
utilize standard fully tested implementation modules for new hardware.
.IP
.B CH
Streams providing raw data channels can have modules pushed for HDLC,
LAPB, LAPF, SS7, etc. to form a complete data link without the
assistance of specialized hardware or unverified implementations.
.IP 2.
To provide media channel services for voice communications.
.IP
.B CH
Streams providing media channels for voice communications can be linked
under the
.BR MG (4)
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide channel services to the
.BR MG (4)
multiplexing driver.
.PP
.B CH
Streams can represent single- or multi-rate ISDN B-channels, or
full-rate statistically multiplexed DS1, E1, E2, or DS3 facilities.
.B CH
Streams can be configured using
.BR chi_ioctl (4).
.\"
.SS Drivers
.PP
.B CH
provides the following Stream types that are directly compatible with
the Stream types provided by other
.BR CH
drivers.  To select one of these Stream types, the
.I device
argument to the
.BR open (2)
call can be one of the following:
.TP
.I /dev/ch
This device provides the
.B CH
protocol service interface using the CH-primitives of the Channel
Interface described in
.BR chi (7),
as interpreted for use with local switching drivers described in
.BR chi_ch (7).
This interface is suitable both for use with other SS7 modules and
drivers, as well as with the
.BR mg (4)
driver using the
.B OpenSwitch
call framework.

.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B CH
driver is the switching workhorse of the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package.  Both CHI and CHI Streams can be opened on the upper multiplex.
Bothe CHI and CHI Streams can be linked on the lower multiplex.  Any
channel of any Stream, whether upper or lower, can be connected through
the multiplex to any other channel.
.PP
The
.B CH
driver can perform simply isochronous conversion functions (e.g. mu-law
to a-law), digital padding, echo cancellation,
compression/decompression, minor rate adaption (e.g, 8-bit A-law into
5-bit GSM), that do not cause flow control considerations as it performs
simply matrix operations.  Preestablished or canned tones an
announcements can be supported by the driver. Dynamic announcemets need
to be provided by an external module or in hardware.  Complex operations
such as HDLC conversion need to be provided upstream or in hardware.
.PP
The
.B CH
driver is intended to support single-rate and multi-rate channels;
however, single-rate and multi-rate connection must match and no
multi-rate conversion will be performed.  The purpose of the
.B CH
driver is to perform simple circuit switching and do it very fast.
.PP
The
.B CH
driver can be modelled as a hardware Time-Space-Time switch, only
switching is performed primarily in software.  (When the driver connects
two channels from the lower multiplex, the data path may be through
hardware instead of software.)
.PP
The
.B CH
driver is, however, may be able to perform channel insertion and
deletion from a span.  For example, an entire E1 or T1 span can be
connected, channel for channel, to another E1 or T1 span.  The drivers
has the ability to remove or insert one or more channels on either side
of the span connection.  The purpose of channel insertion and deletion
is to pull signalling channels out of a span, particularly for ISDN
primary rate connections and SS7 signalling.
.\"
.SS Configuration
.PP
At boot time, or when a new span or circuit is brought into service, a
management program opens a device or pseudo-device driver to obtain a
Stream reprsenting the new channel or span an links the Stream beneath
the CH multiplexing driver. Input-output controls are then used to
assign the channel or span (and timeslots within the span) to circuit
identification numbers within the matrix.  These channel identification
numbers and the mapping to specific hardware should be maintained in
configuration files.
.PP
For example, when a T1 span is put into service on a V401P card, the
management program opens a Stream on the V401P CH device that represents
the T1 span, attaches the Stream to the T1 span, and then links the
Stream beneath the
.B CH
driver.  A configuration table is used to determine the circuit number
assignments for the card and T1 span selected.  An input-output control
is issued to the
.B CH
driver with the multiplex index of the linked span, and the circuit
number assignments for the span.  This input-output control also
identifies other particulars about the span (number of channels, DS0 or
DS0A, etc).  The
.B CH
driver provides the ability for management programs to determine the
lower multiplex identifier that is associated with any circuit or
circuit range.  This allow the management program to perform a
.BR I_PLINK (7)
operation and close the Stream.  It can later discover the multiplex ID
from the circuit assigment (contained in the configuration table) with
an input-output control to the CH driver, so that it know the multiplex
ID to user to remove the circuit or span from service with an
.BR I_PUNLINK (7)
operation.
.PP
As another example, an Ephemeral connection manager process that is
listening for Ephemeral connection requests on the connection management
Stream of the
.BR mg (4)
driver, receives a request to establish an RTP Stream to a remote host.
The Ephemeral connection manager opens a
.BR rawip (4)
device, and pushes the
.BR rtp (4)
module over the device.
The
.BR rtp (4)
module is set to convert the media Stream to that appropriate for the
channel to which the Ephemeral connection will ultimately occur, and the
Stream, which provides a CHI interface, is linked under the CH driver.
It assigns a circuit identification number with an input-output control.
The Ephemeral connection manager then requests that the
.B CH
driver connect the Ephemeral connection to a Gateway circuit through the
matrix.
.PP
While CHI and CHI Streams on the lower multplex are attached to their
circuits or connections for the full time that they are linked, CHI and
CHI Streams on the upper multiplex are not so.  When a user-level
program opens a Stream on the upper multiplex, it remains unattached to
any particular channel.  CHI or CHI primitives are used to connect the
upper multiplex Stream to either a lower or another upper multiplex
Stream.
.PP
Upper multiplex Stream provide the ability to terminate circuit
connections within another STREAMS module or driver above the CH driver.
For example, a number of CHI Streams can be opened on the upper
multiplex and are identified by their device numbers and any asigned
termination identifiers.  These Streams, which represent unconnected
circuits, can then be linked under a tones and announcements driver.
When a switching process such as the
.BR mg (4)
driver wishes to provide a tone or announcment to a circuit or an
ephemeral connection, it request that the CH driver connect the circuit
or ephemeral connection to one on the upper multiplex that terminates at
the tones and announcements driver.  By sending control messages to the
tones and announcements driver, the
.BR mg (4)
driver can then play progress tones or announcments to the user at the
other end of the locally terminated connection.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
The
.B CH
driver provides two interfaces at the lower multiplex: the
.BR chi (7)
interface for single- and multi-rate channels and the
.BR chi (7)
interface for time-division multiplexed channel groups (i.e, spans).
.PP
The
.B CH
driver provides three interfaces at the upper multiplex: the
.BR chi (7)
interface for single- and multi-rate channels, the
.BR chi (7)
interface for time-division multiplexed channel groups (i.e, spans); and
a management control interface for controling connections made across
the matrix.
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSES
.PP
Circuit addresses are 32-bit identifiers that are assigned to circuits
or cirguit groups.  Each circuit (upper or lower) has a unique
identifier within the
.B CH
driver.  One of the identifiers for a circuit within a circuit group can
be used to identify the circuit group as a whole.  Flags are used in
management primitives to indicate whether a particular identifier refers
to a circuit or a circuit group.
.PP
Assignment of circuit identifiers, assign from requirements for
uniqueness, are arbitrary.  For operation with ISUP, a good choice would
be to assign some bit range of the identifier to be identical to the
ISUP circuit identification code for the circuit and the remainder to
uniquely identifier one like ISUP CIC assignment from another.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2)
and
.I I_STR
commands to the
.BR streamio (7)
system calls on the
.I ch_stream
file descriptor.  These management controls are documented in
.BR ch_ioctl (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Unlike other OpenSS7 protocol modules and drivers providing transport
communications services,
.B CH
does not provide a
.BR sockets (3)
interface.  This is because the special needs of switch multiplex
control are divorced from the sockets paradigm.
.PP
On the other hand, the
.PP
For performance reasons, SS7 and ISDN primary rate signalling channels
are not passed through the software switch matrix.  This permits
signalling channels to be subject to a different set of flow control
rules and priorities.  SS7 and ISDN primary rate signalling channels can
be dropped and inserted into a channel group directly from the hardware
driver (e.g, V401P driver).
