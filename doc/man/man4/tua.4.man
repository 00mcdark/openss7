.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B TUA
is an implementation of the SS7 TCAP User Adaptation Layer (TUA).
.[
tua-01
.]
.B TUA
provides a back haul of the services of
.BR tcap (4)
over an IP network using Stream Control Transmission Protocol,
.BR sctp (4),
as defined in RFC 2960.
.[
rfc2960
.]
In addition it provides a building block of redundant
and distributed SS7 systems.  (See
.IR \*(lqNOTICES\*(rq ,
below.)
.PP
.B TUA
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR tcap "(4) or " sctp (4)
streams are lined under the
.B TUA
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide transport or direct TCAP services to
.BR TUA .
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR tua_ioctl (4).
This procedure is normally performed by the
SS7 Configuration Daemon,
.BR ss7confd (8).
.PP
.B TUA
provides the following stream types that are directly compatible with the
stream types provided by
.BR tcap (4).
To select one of these stream types,
.I device
can be one of the following:
.TP
.I /dev/tua
This device provides the
.B TCAP
protocol service interface using the TR- and TC-primitives of the Transaction
Component Interface (TCI) described in
.BR tcapi (7).
This interface is suitable for use with other SS7 modules and drivers.
.TP
.I /dev/tua-tpi
This device provides the
.B TCAP
protocol service interface using the T-primitives of the Transport Provider
Interface,
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
.BR tpi (7),
used for the Transaction Capabilities Application Part as described in
.BR tpi_tcap (7).
The
.BR tpi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is a suitable device for
use with
.BR xnet (3)
or
.BR xti (3)
library
.BR t_open (3)
call and provides the
.B TCAP
interface using XTI
.[
xti revision 1.0
.]
.[
xns99
.]
as described in
.BR xti_tcap (3).
.PP
.B TUA
provides three socket types used by the
.BR sockets (3)
library
.BR socket (3)
call.
.B TUA
provides sockets in the protocol family
.B PF_SS7
using the protocol number
.BR SS7PROTO_TUA .
The
.I socket_type
argument can be one of the following:
.TP
.B SOCK_DGRAM
Provides a connection-less datagram service without regard to order.  This is a
.B TCAP
operations class 1 or 2 service provider.
.TP
.B SOCK_RDM
Provides a connectiono-less reliable datagram service with regard to order.
This is a
.B TCAP
operations class 3 or 4 service provider.
.TP
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET
Provides a connection oriented reliable datagram service with or without
receipt confirmation and flow control.  This is a
.B TCAP
operations class 5 service provider.
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B TUA
can be configured on a system as a drop in transparent replacement for
.BR tcap (4).
In such a configuration, users opening streams or sockets as defined in
.BR tcap (4)
will be opening 
.B tua
streams and sockets, but will be unaware of the difference.  In
.BR OpenSS7 ,
.B sua
is used as the primary mechanism of redundancy and distribution at the
.B TCAP
level, and, when properly configured (see
.BR ss7confd (8)),
.B tua
functions transparently to the TCAP-User.
.PP
Also, opening and binding a
.B tua
stream or socket may result in the opening and binding of a
.BR tcap (4)
stream on the local or remote host in direct support of the local TCAP-User.
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2s)
system calls on the
.BR tua_stream ", " tua_xtistr " or " tua_socket
file descriptor or socket.  These management controls are documented in
.BR tua_ioctl (4).
.PP
In addition,
.B tua
supports
.BR tcap (4)
IO controls.  See
.BR tcap_ioctl (4).
