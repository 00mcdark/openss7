<DT></UL><H2> DESCRIPTION </H2><DD>

<P>

<B> nit_pf </B>

is a STREAMS module that subjects messages arriving on its read
queue to a packet filter and passes only those messages that the
filter accepts on to its upstream neighbor. Such filtering can be
very useful for user-level protocol implementations and for
networking monitoring programs that wish to view only specific
types of events.

<H3> Read-side Behavior  </H3>

<B> nit_pf </B>

applies the current packet filter to all M_DATA and M_PROTO
messages arriving on its read queue. The module prepares these
messages for examination by first skipping over all leading
M_PROTO message blocks to arrive at the beginning of the
message's data portion. If there is no data portion, <B> nit_pf
</B>

accepts the message and passes it along to its upstream neighbor.
Otherwise, the module ensures that the part of the message's data
that the packet filter might examine lies in contiguous memory,
calling the <I> pullupmsg </I>

utility routine if necessary to force contiguity. (Note: this
action destroys any sharing relationships that the subject
message might have had with other messages.) Finally, it applies
the packet filter to the message's data, passing the entire
message upstream to the next module if the filter accepts, and
discarding the message otherwise. See PACKET FILTERS below for
details on how the filter works. <P>

If there is no packet filter yet in effect, the module acts as if
the filter exists but does nothing, implying that all incoming
messages are accepted. IOCTLS below describes how to associate a
packet filter with an instance of <B>nit_pf</B>.  <P>

<B> nit_pf </B>

handles other message types as follows. Upon receiving an M_FLUSH
message specifying that the read queue be flushed, the module
does so, and passes the message on to its upstream neighbor. It
passes all other messages through unaltered to its upper
neighbor.

<H3> Write-side Behavior  </H3>

<B> nit_pf </B>

intercepts M_IOCTL messages for the <I>ioctl</I> described below.
Upon receiving an M_FLUSH message specifying that the write queue
be flushed, the module does so and passes the message on to the
module or driver below. The module passes all other messages
through unaltered to its lower neighbor.

<B> nit_pf </B>

responds to the following <I>ioctl</I>.  <P> NIOCSETF This <I>
ioctl </I>

directs the module to replace its current packet filter, if any,
with the filter specified by the `<B>struct packetfilt</B> '
pointer named by its final argument. This structure is defined in
<B> &lt;net/packetfilt.h> </B>

as <UL>

<UL>

<PRE>
struct packetfilt {
    u_char   Pf_Priority;   /* priority of filter */
    u_char   Pf_FilterLen;  /* # of cmds in list */
    u_short  Pf_Filter[ENMAXFILTERS];
                            /* filter command list */
};
</PRE> </UL>

</UL>

<BR>

<P>

The <I> Pf_Priority </I>

field is included only for compatibility with other packet filter
implementations and is otherwise ignored. The packet filter
itself is specified in the <I> Pf_Filter </I>

array as a sequence of two-byte commands, with the <I>
Pf_FilterLen </I>

field giving the number of commands in the sequence. This
implementation restricts the maximum number of commands in a
filter (<B>ENMAXFILTERS</B>) to 40. The next section describes
the available commands and their semantics.

<DT></UL><H2> PACKET FILTERS  </H2><DD>

<P>

A packet filter consists of the filter command list length (in
units of <I>u_short</I>s), and the filter command list itself.
(The priority field mentioned above is ignored in this
implementation.) Each filter command list specifies a sequence of
actions that operate on an internal stack of <I>u_short</I>s
(&quot;shortwords&quot;). Each shortword of the command list
specifies one of the actions ENF_PUSHLIT, ENF_PUSHZERO, or
ENF_PUSHWORD +<I>n</I>, which respectively push the next
shortword of the command list, zero, or shortword <I> n </I>

of the subject message on the stack, and a binary operator from
the set { ENF_EQ, ENF_NEQ, ENF_LT, ENF_LE, ENF_GT, ENF_GE,
ENF_AND, ENF_OR, ENF_XOR } which then operates on the top two
elements of the stack and replaces them with its result. When
both an action and operator are specified in the same shortword,
the action is performed followed by the operation. <P>

The binary operator can also be from the set { ENF_COR, ENF_CAND,
ENF_CNOR, ENF_CNAND }. These are &quot;short-circuit&quot;
operators, in that they terminate the execution of the filter
immediately if the condition they are checking for is found, and
continue otherwise. All pop two elements from the stack and
compare them for equality; ENF_CAND returns false if the result
is false; ENF_COR returns true if the result is true; ENF_CNAND
returns true if the result is false; ENF_CNOR returns false if
the result is true. Unlike the other binary operators, these four
do not leave a result on the stack, even if they continue. <P>

The short-circuit operators should be used when possible, to
reduce the amount of time spent evaluating filters. When they are
used, you should also arrange the order of the tests so that the
filter will succeed or fail as soon as possible; for example,
checking the IP destination field of a UDP packet is more likely
to indicate failure than the packet type field. <P>

The special action ENF_NOPUSH and the special operator ENF_NOP
can be used to only perform the binary operation or to only push
a value on the stack. Since both are (conveniently) defined to be
zero, indicating only an action actually specifies the action
followed by ENF_NOP, and indicating only an operation actually
specifies ENF_NOPUSH followed by the operation. <P>

After executing the filter command list, a non-zero value (true)
left on top of the stack (or an empty stack) causes the incoming
packet to be accepted and a zero value (false) causes the packet
to be rejected. (If the filter exits as the result of a short-
circuit operator, the top-of-stack value is ignored.) Specifying
an undefined operation or action in the command list or
performing an illegal operation or action (such as pushing a
shortword offset past the end of the packet or executing a binary
operator with fewer than two shortwords on the stack) causes a
filter to reject the packet.

<DT></UL><H2> EXAMPLES </H2><DD>

<P>

The reverse ARP daemon program (<B>rarpd</B>(8C)) uses code
similar to the following fragment to construct a filter that
rejects all but RARP packets. That is, is accepts only packets
whose Ethernet type field has the value ETHERTYPE_REVARP. <P>

<PRE>
     struct ether_header eh;       /* used only for offset values */
     struct packetfilt pf;
     register u_short *fwp = pf.Pf_Filter;
     u_short offset;
<PRE>
</PRE>
     /*
      * Set up filter.  Offset is the displacement of the Ethernet
      * type field from the beginning of the packet in units of
      * u_shorts.
      */
<BR>

     offset = ((u_int) &eh.ether_type - (u_int) &eh.ether_dhost) / sizeof (u_short);
     *fwp++ = ENF_PUSHWORD + offset;
     *fwp++ = ENF_PUSHLIT;
     *fwp++ = htons(ETHERTYPE_REVARP);
     *fwp++ = ENF_EQ;
     pf.Pf_FilterLen = fwp - &pf.Pf_Filter[0];
</PRE> <P>

This filter can be abbreviated by taking advantage of the ability
to combine actions and operations: <P>

<PRE>
     ...
     *fwp++ = ENF_PUSHWORD + offset;
     *fwp++ = ENF_PUSHLIT | ENF_EQ;
     *fwp++ = htons(ETHERTYPE_REVARP);
     ...
</PRE>

<DT></UL><H2> WARNINGS </H2><DD>

<P>

The module name `<B>pf</B>' used in the system configuration file
and as argument to the I_PUSH <I> ioctl </I>

is provisional and subject to change. <P>

The <I> Pf_Priority </I>

field of the <I> packetfilt </I>

structure is likely to be removed.
