.SH NAME
.B iax
\- IAX Trunking over Internet Protocol
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B IAX
is an implementation of the Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX2) protocol defined in RFC 5456.
.[
rfc5456
.]
.B IAX
provides the encapsulation of control and media in 
.BR udp (4)
packets.
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSING
.PP
When configured a PPA is associated with the MXI interface.  The PPA to
which the MXI interface is attached is a socket address.  The PPA
address represents the local IP address and port number for UDP.  When
the MXI interface is enabled, the remote address is also a socket
address.  In this case, the remote address represent the remote IP
address and port number for UDP.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
The MXI interface supports a set of Local Management Interface
input-output controls using
.BR ioctl (2s)
and
.IR I_STR (7)
.BR streamio (7)
system calls on the
.I iax_stream
file descriptor.
The management structure and constant definitions for MXI are described
in
.BR mxi_ioctl (4)
and contained in the
.RB < sys/mxi_ioctl.h >
header file.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
IAX has serious security issues and cannot be used on the open Internet.
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
IAX is buggy by design.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR VOIP (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH VERSIONS
.PP
The
.B IAX
module is specific to the OpenSS7
.BR VOIP (4)
stack.  This is Version 1 of the module.
.PP
.B IAX
interfaces are consistent with MXI Revision 0.9.2.
