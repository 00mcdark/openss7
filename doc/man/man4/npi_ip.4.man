.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B IP
driver provide an interface between
.I STREAMS
drivers and the Linux IP subsystem.  It presents an
.BR npi (7)
Netwwork Provider Interface 
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
to
.I STREAMS
drivers and provides access to the native Linux IP subsystem.
.PP
.B IP
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
pseudo-device driver and provides the following devices:
.TP
.I /dev/npi_ip
This devices provides acess to the
.B IP
protocol service interface using the N-primitives of the Network Provider Interface,
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
used for the Internet Protocol as described in
.BR npi_ip (7).
The
.BR npi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with
the
.BR sockets (3)
library and provides the
.B IP
interface using sockets as described in
.BR ip (7).
This stream provides both connectionless and connection-oriented NPI services.
.TP
.I /dev/rawip
This device provides access to the
.B IP
protocol service interface using the T-primitives of the Transport Provider
Interface,
.[
TPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
used for the Internet Protocol as described in
.BR tpi_ip (7).
The
.BR tpi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with
the
.BR xnet (3)
or
.BR xti (3)
library and proivdes the
.B IP
interface using XTI as described in
.BR xti_ip (3).
.PP
.B IP
provides one socket type for use by the
.BR sockets (3)
library
.BR socket (7)
calls.
.B IP
provides sockets in the protocol family
.B PF_INET
using the protocol number
.BR IPPROTO_IP .
The
.I socket_type
argument can be one of the following:
.TP
.B SOCK_RAW
A standard
.I SOCK_RAW
socket that provides direct access to IP packets.  This socket uses the
underlying
.I /dev/rawip
transport service provider.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The following entries in
.B /etc/protosw
provides the information necessary for
.BR socksys (4)
to use these devices:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
PF_INET     SOCK_RAW      IPPROTO_IP    /dev/rawip   tpi   clts
PF_INET     SOCK_RAW      IPPROTO_IP    /dev/npi_ip  npi   clts
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
For additional information, see
.BR socksys (4)
and
.BR protosw (5).
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2)
and
.BR streamio (7)
.I I_STR
system calls on the
.IR ip_stream ", " ip_xtistr " or " ip_socket .
These management controls are described in
.BR ip_ioctl (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B IP
has several implementations.  This manpage is for the
.IR STREAMS (4)
implementation.  There is also an
.BR INET (4)
implementation which provides
.BR tpi (7)
access to the Linux NET4 version of
.BR IP .
For more information, see
.BR ip (7).
.PP
Note that using
.BR sockets (3)
over
.I STREAMS
for the
.B IP
driver might be rather inefficient: unless you need to push modules, use a
direct Linux native socket instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The current
.B IP
pseudo-device driver hook directly into the Linux kernel IP subsystem.
Previous approaches used a STREAMS over Sockets method that was inefficient
and inflexible.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.I /dev/rawip
device providing a Transport Provider Interface
.[
TPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
is roughly compatible with the raw ip TPI streams provided by
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
and other
.IR UNIX \(rg
implementations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The TPI and NPI interfaces to IP services are implementation dependent and
are not subject to standardization.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
.I STREAMS
access to IP services was originally performed using an STREAMS over Socket
approach using the
.BR INET (4)
pseudo-device driver from the
.I strinet
package.  A more flexible direct implementation was performed using a separate
driver that hooks directly into the Linux IP subsystem.
