.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B HDLC
is an implementation of the High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) Procedures as
specified in
.B IS0 3309
.[
ISO 3309
.]
and
.BR "ISO 4335" .
.[
ISO 4335
.]
.B HDLC
is intended to be used with the
.BR lapb (4),
.[
x25
.]
.BR lapd (4),
.[
q921
.]
.BR lapf (4),
.[
q922
.]
multiplexing drivers.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B HDLC
is implemented as a pushable
.IR STREAMS (4)
module.  The
.B HDLC
mdoule can be pushed over a stream conforming to the Channel Interface (CHI)
as described in
.BR chi (7).
The
.B HDLC
module provides HDLC access to the bit stream from the channel provided by the
.BR chi (7)
Stream below it, by performing HDLC functions on the raw bit stream.
The upper interface provided by the
.B HDLC
module is the Communications Device Interface (CDI) as described in
.BR cdi (7).
.PP
.B HDLC
streams can be linked under
.BR dl (4)
drivers
.BR lapd (4),
.BR lapb (4),
.BR lapf (4),
.BR gr303 (4),
.BR v52 (4),
using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide a complete Data Link that can then be linked under an
.BR isdn (4),
.BR fr (4),
.BR idlc (4),
.BR dpnss (4),
.BR iua (4),
.BR gr303ua (4),
.BR v5ua (4)
or
.BR dua (4)
driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide data link services to the Layer 3 protocol.  This is normally
performed, as required, by the ISDN Configuration Daemon,
.BR isdnconfd (8).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B HDLC
has been implemented as a pushable module to ease the development of ISDN Data
Link drivers for various cards.  All that is required is for the card to
provide a Channel Interface (CHI),
.BR chi (7),
and push the
.BR hdlc (4)
and
.BR dl (4)
modules to provide a complete and compliant Q.921
.[
q921
.]
Data Link.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B HDLC
is implemented internally as a soft-HDLC using host-based table lookups.
While this is fairly efficient, devices that are capable of performing this
function in hardware should provide the Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.BR cdi (7),
directly.
An example of a device that does not include HDLC is the
.BR x400p (4)
driver.  An example of one that does, is the
.BR acb56 (4)
driver.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B HDLC
modules are not normally pushed or accessed directly by user-level programs.
The
.B HDLC
module is used directly by some test and monitoring programs.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
The
.B HDLC
module responds to Local Management Interface (LMI),
.BR lmi_ioctl (4),
IO controls as interpreted for
.B HDLC
operation as described in
.BR hdlc_ioctl (4).
