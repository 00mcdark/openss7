.[

.[

and
ANSI T1.114.
.[
t1.114
.]
.B TCAP
provides reliable sequenced or unsequenced delivery of packets over a
connectionless transport between two
.B TCAP
endpoints.
.B TCAP
provides stong assurances that the data arrives in order on a Stream, if
requested, and maintains sequencing of packets in the face of most network
failures.
.B TCAP
is the roughly the equivalent of a remote procedure call for SS7 and is based
closely on the Remote Operations Service Execution (ROSE) X.219.
.[
x.219
.]
Unlike ROSE, which uses a connection-mode transport provider,
.B TCAP
uses the connectionless mode network services of the Signalling Connection
Control Part (see
.BR sccp (4))
or SCCP User Adaptation Layer (see
.BR sua (4))
to transfer packets.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B TCAP
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR sccp "(4), " sua (4)
or other compatible network provider Streams are bound and linked under the
.B TCAP
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7).
These linked Streams provide network services to
.BR TCAP .
Once linked, the Streams must be configured using
.BR tcap_ioctl (4).

.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B SCCP
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver provides a number of device names that can be opened by user programs with the
.BR open (2s)
system call (see above under
.RI \(lq "Device Names" \(rq).
The
.BR open (2s)
system call returns a file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
that can be used ot make other system calls on the open
.B TCAP
Stream.
Each
.B TCAP
Stream provides a service primitive interface that implements the TCAP protocol 
The system call,
.BR putpmsg (2s),
can be called to issue service primitives on the interface;
.BR getpmsg (2s),
to receive primitives.
.BR ioctl (2s)
as described in
.BR streamio (7)
and
.BR tcap_ioctl (4)
can be used to manage the Stream and the TCAP provider.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
When the TCAP driver is configured, SCCP Streams are opened and linked under
the multiplexing driver.  Each SCCP Stream represents a connection between a
local TCAP Entity and remote peer TCAP Entities.  Input-output controls are
used to configure each lower multiplex Stream.  SCCP Streams must be bound for
connectionless operation before being linked, however, until they are
configured, incoming transactions will be aborted.
.PP
Once configured, TCAP User Streams can be opened on the upper multiplex.
These TCAP User Streams are not associated with a TCAP Entity until they are
bound.  When the
.BR TC_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive is issued, the address contained in the request is a TCAP address.
A TCAP address consists of an SCCP address or TCAP Entity identifier, and an
Application Context.  This information is sufficient for the TCAP driver to
determine the TCAP Entity with which to associate the TCAP User Stream and to
bind the TCAP User to an Application Context.
.PP
Configuration is performed using the TCAP driver configuration utility.  This
utility reads a configuration file used to define the objects necessary for
configuration.  The configuration file contains entries that define the SCCP
provider and TCAP Entity relationships as follows:
.nf
.sp
.RI < teid "> <" variant "> <" version "> <" options "> <" sap ">
.fi
.TP
.I teid
An integer number, assigned locally, from 1 to 31, identifying the TCAP
entity, or a Object Identifier (OID) used to globally identify the the TCAP
entity application.  A global OID is the portion of the Application Context
that identifies the overall Application, in numbers and dots notation.  When
both the integer and OID TCAP Entity identifiers are specified, they are
separated by a comma
.RB ( , )
with no intervening whitespace.
.TP
.I variant
Specifies the variant of the TCAP protocol supported by the TCAP Entity.
The protocol variant can be a single dash
.RB ( - ),

The configuration utility reads this configuration file and performs the
following steps for each entry in the file:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The utility opens a Stream on the TCAP driver using the
.B /dev/tcap-mgmt
device.
.IP 2.
The utility creates a new TCAP Entity or alters an existing TCAP Entity as
specified by the
.I teid
field and fills out the protocol variant, version and options information
associated with the TCAP Entity.
The
.I TCAP_IOCSCONFIG
.BR tcap_ioctl (4)
command for the
.I TCAP_OBJ_TYPE_TE
object
is used.
.IP 3.
For each
.I sap
entry, the utility creates a new SCCP SAP object or alters an existing SCCP
SAP object and associates it with the TCAP entity using the
.I TCAP_IOCSCONFIG
.BR tcap_ioctl (4)
command for the
.I TCAP_OBJ_TYPE_SP
object.
The SCCP SAP is assigned the SS7 signalling point code and Subsystem Number
specified in the configuration file field.
.IP 4.
For each
.I sap
entry, the utility opens an SCCP Stream by opening the
.B /dev/sccp
device and links the SCCP Stream under the TCAP multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_PLINK (7)
.BR streamio (7)
input-output control.
The utility can optionally bind the SCCP Stream to the SCCP SAP before
linking.  When bound in advance, the linking operation discovers the allocated
SCCP SAP object and associates the SCCP Stream with the SCCP SAP.
.IP 5.
When the SCCP Stream is not bound before linking, the utility associates the
SCCP Stream with an SCCP SAP using the
.I TCAP_IOCSCONFIG
.BR tcap_ioctl (4)
command for the
.I TCAP_OBJ_TYPE_SC
object.
.IP 6.
The TCAP Entity configuraiton is complete and the next line of the
configuration file is processed by the configuration utility starting at Step 2.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that, although the SCCP normally supports binding of SCCP SAPs that
include a restrictive global title range, the TCAP device configuration
utility only supports binding of SCCP Streams to entire subsystems.
.PP
Note also that the protocol variant for the TCAP Entity, as described in the
.IR variant ", " version " and " options
fields, can be different from the protocol variant used for the
SCCP SAP in the
.I sap
field.  This is to support the widespread practice in North America for
transporting ETSI TCAP over ANSI SCCP.
