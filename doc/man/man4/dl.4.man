.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B DL
is an implementation of the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Data
Link (LAPD/LAPF) as specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.920/921,
.[
q920
.]
.[
q921
.]
and the Data Communications (LAPB) as specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.25.

.\"
.\"
.PP
.B DL
streams can be linked under an
.BR isdn (4),
.BR iua (4),
or other
.BR ISDN (4)
multiplexing driver
using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
command of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide data link services to the Layer 3 protocol.
This is normally performed by the ISDN Configuration Daemon,
.BR isdnconfd (8).
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B DL
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR hdlc (4)
streams are linked under the
.B DL
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide physical link services to
.BR DL .
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR dl_ioctl (4).
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B DL
provides the following stream types.
The
.I dl_device
argument to the
.BR open (2s)
call can be on of the following:
.TP
.I /dev/dl
This devices provides the
.B DL
protocol services interface using the DL-primitives of the Data Link Provider
Interface (DLPI) described in
.BR dlpi (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2s)
and
.BR streamio (7)
.I I_STR
system calls on the
.IR dl_stream .
These management IO controls are documented in
.BR dl_ioctl (4).
