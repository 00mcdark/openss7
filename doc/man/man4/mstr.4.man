.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B mstr
is a
.I STREAMS
module that is pushed over any
.IR Stream ,
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
or
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR fifo (4s).
.PP
Aside from being a
.I STREAMS
module,
.B mstr
performs no actions other than to convert
.BR M_PROTO "(9) and " M_PCPROTO (9)
messages received from above into
.BR M_CTL "(9) and " M_PCCTL (9)
messages pass downward (resp.); and visa versa in the upstream direction.
That is, each
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message received from above is changed to a
.BR M_CTL (9)
message type and passed downstream without queuing nor consideration for flow
control.  Also, any
.BR M_CTL (9)
message received from below is converted to a
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message and passed upstream.  The same is also true for
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
and
.BR M_PCCTL (9)
messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The primary purpose of the
.B mstr
module is to make the internal multi-stream interface provided by some
standard drivers available to user-space programs.  The module is simply
pushed over any driver that implements the multi-stream internal
.BR M_CTL "(9) or " M_PCCTL (9)
interface, or that otherwise requires conversion to and from
.BR M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9)
and
.BR M_CTL "(9) or " M_PCCTL (9)
messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mstr
is implementation-specific to the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package.

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B mstr
is compatible with the modules implementing the implementation-specific
multi-stream interface, or in any case where it is necessary to convert
.BR M_PROTO "(9) and " M_PCPROTO (9)
messages to and from
.BR M_CTL "(9) and " M_PCCTL (9)
across the module.
