.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B DLC_GET_EXCEP
input-output control returns asynchronous exception notifications to the
application user.
.IP \fBNote:\fP
This input-output contorl subroutine operation is not used by the kernel user
since all exception conditions are passed to the kernel user by way of their
exception handler.
.PP
The argument to the
.B DLC_ADDR_FUNC_ADDR
input-output control is a pointer to a
.B dlc_getx_arg
structure, formatted as follows:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
union dlc_ext_res {
    struct dlc_sape_res sape_res;
    struct dlc_stas_res stas_res;
    struct dlc_stah_res stah_res;
    struct dlc_radd_res radd_res;
};

#define DLC_MAX_EXT (sizeof(union dlc_ext_res))

struct dlc_getx_arg {
    uint32_t user_sap_corr;
    uint32_t user_ls_corr;
    uint32_t result_ind;
    uint32_t result_code;
    uint8_t result_ext[DLC_MAX_EXT];
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
The
.B dlc_getx_arg
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I user_sap_corr
Indicates the user service access point (SAP) correlator for this exception.
This is the user SAP correlator that was specified by the user with the
.BR DLC_ENABLE_SAP (4)
input-output control.
.TP
.I user_ls_corr
Indicates the user link station (LS) correlator for this exception.  This is
the user LS correlator that was specified by the user with the
.BR DLC_START_LS (4)
input-output control.
.TP
.I result_ind
Indicates the result indicator that can assume values as follows:
.RS
.TP
.B DLC_TEST_RES
Indicates that the test is complete: a non-extended result.  When this bit is
set, it indicates that the link test has competed as indicated in the result
code.
.TP
.B DLC_SAPE_RES
Indicates that the SAP is enabled: an extended result.  When this bit is
set, it indicats that the SAP is active and ready for LSs to be started.
.TP
.B DLC_SAPD_RES
Indicates that the SAP is enabled: a non-extended result.  When this bit is
set, it indicates that the SAP has been terminated as indicated in the result
code.
.TP
.B DLC_STAS_RES
Indicates that the LS has started: an extended result.  When this bit is set,
it indicates that the link station is connected to the remote station in
asyncrhonous or normal disconnected mode.  GDLC is waiting for link receive
data from the device driver or additional commands from the user such as the
.BR DLC_CONTACT (4)
input-output control operation.
.TP
.B DLC_STAH_RES
Indicates that the link station (LS) is halted: an extended result.  When
this bit is set, it indicates that the LS has terminated due to a
.BR DLC_HALT_LS (4)
input-output control operation from the user, a remote disconnect, or an error
condition indicated in the result code.
.TP
.B DLC_DIAL_RES
Indicates that the phone can be dialed: a non-extended result.  When this bit
is set, it indicates that the user can now manually dial an outgoing call to
the remote station.
.TP
.B DLC_IWOT_RES
Indicates inactivity without termination: a non-extended result.  When this bit
is set, it indicates that the LS protocol activity from the remote station has
terminated for the length of time specified in the configuration (receive
inactivity timeout).  The local station remains active and notifies the user if
the remote station begins to respond.  Additional notifications of inactivity
without termination are suppressed until the inactivity condition clears.
.TP
.B DLC_IEND_RES
Indicates inactivity has ended: a non-extended result.  When this bit is set,
it indicates that the LS protocol activity fromt he remote station has
restarted after a condition of inactivity without termination.
.TP
.B DLC_CONT_RES
Indicates that the remote LS has been contacted: a non-extended result.  When
this bit is set, it indicates that the GDLC has either received a Set Mode, or
has received a positive response to a Set Mode initiated by the local LS.  GDLC
is now able to send and receive normal sequenced data on this LS.
.TP
.B DLC_RADD_RES
Indicates that the remote address or name has changed: an extended result.
When this bit is set, it indicates that the remote LS address or name has been
changed from the previous value.  This can occur on synchronous data link
control (SDLC) links when negotiating a point-to-point connection, for example.
.RE
.TP
.I result_code
Indicates the result code.  The following values specify the result codes for
GDLC.  Negative return codes that are even indicates that the error condition
can be remedied by restarting the LS returning the error.  Return codes that
are odd indicate that the error is catastrophic, and, at the minimum, the SAP
must be restarted.  Additional error data may be obtained from the GDLC error
log and link trace entries.

.TP
.I result_ext
Indicates the result extension.  Several results carry extension areas to
provide additional information.  The user must provide a full-sized area for
each result reqeusted as there is no way to tell if the next result is extended
or non-extended.  The extended result areas are described by
.I result_ind
type below:

.TP
.I max_net_send
Indicates the maximum number of bytes that the user can write for each packet
when writing network data.  This is genrally based on a communictions buffer
page cluster size, bit is not necessarily limited to a single communications
buffer structure since communications buffers can be linked.

    uint8_t res[3];
    uint8_t rsap;
    uint32_t max_data_off;
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
The
.B dlc_stas_res
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I maxif
Indicates the maximum byte size allowable for user data.  This value is
determined from the value supplied by the user at the start link station,
.BR DLC_START_LS (4),
and the actual number of bytes that can be handled by the GDLC and device
handler on a single transmit or receive.  Generally this value is less than the
size of a communications buffer page cluster.  However, some communications
devices may be able to link communications buffers together, so the maximum
I-field receivable may exceed the length of a single communications buffer.
The returned value never exceeds the value supplied by the user, but may be
smaller if buffering is not large enough to hold the specified value.
.TP
.I rport_addr_len
Indicates the length of the remote port network address in bytes.
.TP
.I rport_addr
Indicates the binary value of the remote port network address.
.TP
.I rname_len
Indicates the byte length of the remote port network name.  This is returned
only when name discovery procedures are used to locate the remote station.
Otherwise, this field is set to zero (0).  Network names can be from one (1) to
.B DLC_MAX_ADDR
characters in length.
.TP
.I rname
Indicates the name used by the remote SAP.  This field is valid only if
name-discovery procedures were used to locate the remote station.
.TP
.I res
Reserved field, set to zero (0).
.TP
.I rsap
Indicates the binary value of the remote SAP address.
.TP
.I max_data_off
Indicates the write data offset in bytes of a communications buffer where
transmit data must minimally begin.  This allows ample room for the DLC and MAC
headers to be inserted if needed.  Some DLCs may be able to prepend additional
communication buffers for their headers, and in this case will set this field
to zero (0).
.RS
.PP
This field is only valid for kernel users that pass in a communications buffer
structure on write operations.
.IP \fBNote:\fP
To align the data moves to a particular byte boundary, the kernel user may wish
to choose a value larger than the minimum value returned.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that
.IR AIX \(rg
terminology for GDLC conflict with that of LLC
.[
iso/iec 8802-2 : 1998
.]
and LAPB.
.[
iso7776
.]
Under IEEE terminology, a link station is associated with the MAC entity or a
point-to-point data link endpoint, and one or more service access points (SAP)
are associated with the one link station.  LLC Type 2 supporting link stations
can have associated with them zero or more connections that represent a
connection between a local MAC address and a remote MAC address, a local SAP
and a remote SAP.  LAPB link stations can have associated with them 1
connection that represents a connection between the local and remote stations.
LAPD
.[
q921
.]
link stations can have associated with them one or more connections that
represent a connection associated with a local and remote SAP (TEI).
LAPF
.[
q922
.]
link stations can have associated with them one or more connections that
represent a connection associated with a local and remote SAP (DLCI).
.PP
.IR AIX \(rg
terminology in the GDLC documentation refers to this latter connection,
confusingly, as a link station (LS).
The
.IR AIX \(rg
GDLC service access point (SAP) is really a Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) and
DLSAP combination under the DLPI,
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
and the
.IR AIX \(rg
GDLC link station (LS) is really a connection identifier.
It may be helpful to think of a GDLC link station (LS) as an identifier of a
local and remote link station combination for a given DLSAP.
