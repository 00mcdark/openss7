.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B GR303UA
is an implementation of the
.I Digital Loop Carrier (IDLC)
defined in
.BR GR-303-CORE .
.B GR303UA
provides a backhaul of the services of
.BR gr303 (4)
over an IP network using
Stream Control Transmission Protocol,
.BR sctp (4),
as defined in
.BR "RFC 2960" .
.PP
.B GR303UA
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR gr303 "(4) or " sctp (4)
streams are linked under the
.B GR303UA
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide transport to remote ASP or SG,
or direct GR303 services to
.BR GR303UA .
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR gr303ua_ioctl (4)
input-output controls.  This is normally performed by the ISDN Configuration Daemon,
.BR isdnconfd (8).
.PP
.B GR303UA
streams can be linked under a
.BR idlc (4)
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide data link services to the IDLC Layer 3 protocol.  This is normally
performed by the ISDN Configuration Daemon,
.BR isdnconfd (8).
.PP
.B GR303UA
provides the following
.BR gr303 (4)
devices.  The
.I gua_device
argument to the
.BR open (2)
call can be one of the following:
.TP
.I /dev/gr303ua
This device provides the
.BR gr303 (4)
protocol services using the DL-primitives of the
.I Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)
described in
.BR dlpi (7),
with the corrigendum described in
.BR dlpi_gr303ua (7).
Streams that result from opening this device are directly compatible with
.BR gr303 (4)
streams.  This interface is suitable for use with other
.BR ISDN (4)
modules and drivers or directly by user-level programs using the
.BR dlpi (7)
interface.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Unlike other
.B OpenSS7
protocol modules and drivers providing transport services,
.B GR303UA
does not provide a
.BR sockets (3)
interface.
.PP
When acting as a Signalling Gateway (SG), streams on this device are not
necessarily opened and the SG runs as kernel daemon only.
.PP
.B GR303UA
can be configured on a system as a drop in transparent replacement for
.BR gr303 (4).
In such a configuration, users opening streams as defined in
.BR gr303 (4)
will be opening
.BR gr303ua ()
streams, but will be unaware of the difference.  In
.BR OpenSS7 ,
.BR gr303ua ()
is used as the primary mechanism of redundancy and distribution of the data
link layer, and, when properly configured (see
.BR isdnconfd (8)),
.BR gr303ua ()
functions transparently to the IDLC Layer 3.
.PP
Also, opening and binding a
.BR gr303ua ()
stream may result in the opening and binding of a
.BR gr303 (4)
stream on the local or remote host in direct support of the local IDLC user.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of input-output controls using
.BR ioctl (2)
and the
.IR I_STR (7)
command to the
.BR streamio (7)
system calls on the
.I gua_stream
file descriptor.  These management controls are documented in
.BR gr303ua_ioctl (4).
.PP
In addition,
.BR gr303ua ()
supports
.BR dl (4)
input-output controls (see
.BR dl_ioctl (4)).
