.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ISUA
is an implementation of the SS7 ISUP User Adaptation Layer (ISUA) defined in
draft-bidulock-sigtran-isua-01.txt.
.B ISUA
provides a back haul of the serivces of
.BR isup (4)
over an IP network using Stream Control Transmission Protocol,
.BR sctp (4),
as defined in RFC 2960.
.[
rfc2960
.]
In addition it provides a building block of redundant
and distributed SS7 systems.  (See
.IR \*(lqNOTICES\*(rq ,
below.)
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B ISUA
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR isup "(4), " bicc "(4) or " sctp (4)
streams are linked under the
.B ISUA
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide transport or direct
.B ISUP
services to
.BR ISUA .
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR isua_ioctl (4).
This procedure is normally performed by the SS7 Configuration Daemon,
.BR ss7confd (8).
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B ISUA
provides the following stream types that are directly compatible with the
stream types provided by
.BR isup (4).
To select one of these stream types,
.I device
can be selected from the following:
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I /dev/isua
This device provides
.B ISUP
protocol service interfce using the Call Control Interface (CCI)
.[
cci
.]
described in
.BR cci (7).
This interface is suitable for use with other SS7 modules and drivers, as well
as with user-level programs such as the
.BR cframe (3)
library using the
.B OpenSwitch
call framework.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Unlike other SS7 protocol modules and drivers providing transport services,
.B ISUA
does not provide a
.BR sockets (3)
interface.  This is because the special needs of call control are divorced
from the sockets paradigm.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B ISUA
can be configured on a system as a drop in transparent replacement for
.BR isup (4).
In such a configuration, users opening streams or sockets as defined in
.BR isup (4)
will be opening
.B isua
streams and sockets, but will be unaware of the difference.  In
.BR OpenSS7 ,
.B isua
is used as the primary mechanism of redundancy and distribution at the
.B ISUP
level, and, when properly configured (see
.BR ss7confd (8)),
.B isua
functions transparently to the ISUP-User.
.\"
.\"
.PP
Also, opening and binding a
.B isua
stream or socket may result in the opening and binding of an
.B isup (4)
stream on the local or remote host in direct support of the local ISUP-User.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call on the
.I isua_stream
file descriptor or socket.  These management controls are documented in
.BR isua_ioctl (4).
.\"
.\"
.PP
In addition,
.B isua
supports
.BR isup (4)
IO controls.
See
.BR isup_ioctl (4).
