.TP
.I fd

.PP
When a configuration change is detected by the

driver that would result in a different response to the
.BR SAD_GAP ,
.B SAD_VML
or
.B SAD_LAP
input-output controls (that is, the addition, removal or alteration of the autopush characteristics
of a STREAMS module or driver), the module will issue a
.BR M_PCSIG (9)
message, containing the
.RI { SIGPOLL }
signal,
to all open Stream heads (except not necessarily the Stream head which effected the change).
This results in the immediate generation of a
.RI { SIGPOLL }
signal to processes registered for the
.B S_MSG
event using the
.IR I_SETSIG (7)
input-output control, or to the process group leader.  See
.BR M_PCSIG (9).
.PP
This feature was added to permit the STREAMS SNMP agent to cache configuration information and hold
open a Stream to the
.B sad
driver and receive a
.RI { SIGPOLL }
signal whenever the agent cache is invalidated.

.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Historically, the
.B sad
driver has not used user credentials on a IO control by IO control basis, but
permits access to the privileged
.B SAD_SAP
command on the basis of file access controls.  This means that a user program
can open the
.RI \*(lq /dev/sad/admin \*(rq
device while suid root and then downgrade its credentials for security, but
still have the ability to modify the autopush list for
.IR STREAMS (4)
devices.
