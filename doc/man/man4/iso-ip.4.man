.SH NAME
.B ISO-IP, ISO-UDP
\- ISO CLNS over IP
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ISO-IP
is an implementation of an ISO CLNP
.[
ISO/IEC 8473-1 : 1993
.]
Subnetwork Convergence Function Protocol directly over the services of IP
.[
rfc793
.]
or between networks using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP),
.[
rfc768
.]
as defined for experimental use in RFC 1070.
.[
rfc1070
.]
.PP
.B ISO-IP
provides for simple and straightforward encapsulation of CLNS NPDUs in IP
packets or UDP datagrams.
.PP
For providing the ISO CLNS using IP, the IP protocol number
.B 80
has been assigned;
.[
rfc1070
.]
using UDP, the UDP well-known port number
.B 147
has been assigned.
.[
rfc1070
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
For a Connectionless-mode Network Service Provider
.[
x213
.]
using IP and protocol number
.B 80
providing the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.BR npi (7),
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
the
.I STREAMS
pseudo-device driver
.B /dev/iso-ip
can be opened.
.PP
For a Connectionless-mode Network Service Provider
.[
x213
.]
using UDP and port number
.B 147
providing the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.BR npi (7),
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
the
.I STREAMS
pseudo-device driver
.B /dev/iso-udp
can be opened.
.PP
Either Stream can be used directly, or bound and linked underneath the
.BR tp4 (4)
driver to provide Connectionless-mode Network Services for Transport Protocol
Class 4 operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
Both forms of the Network Service Provider provide the
.IR STREAMS -based
Service Interface specified in the Network Provider Interface.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Both RFCs
.[
rfc1069
.]
.[
rfc1070
.]
are described as
.IR Experimental .
The RFC Editor lists both with status
.IR UNKNOWN .
Neither of these RFCs propose a standard. Use of these protocols in the
DARPA Internet is not recommended.
.PP
Nevertheless, the
.B ISO-IP
version of the protocol provides a good mechanism for transporting CLNS over
LANs; the
.B ISO-UDP
version, transporting CLNS between LANs over an Internetwork using existing IP
bridges, switches and routers.
.PP
.B ISO-IP
and
.B ISO-UDP
have the advantages that they reuse exsiting IP network management and
internetwork routing; i.e, they do not require the use of X.75 packet data
switches, or ES-IS/IS-IS routing protocols.  (Well, ES-IS, RFC 995,
.[
rfc995
.]
is still
required; and
IS-IS, RFC 1142
.[[
rfc1142
.]].)
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B /dev/iso-ip
can be implemented as a pushable
.I STREAMS
module, named
.RI \(lq iso-ip \(rq,
that can be pushed over an
.BR np_ip (4)
NPI Stream or
.BR rawip2 (4)
TPI Stream using
.BR autopush (8).
.PP
.B /dev/iso-udp
can be implemented as a pushable
.I STREAMS
module, named
.RI \(lq iso-udp \(rq,
that can be pushed over an
.BR np_udp (4)
NPI Stream or
.BR udp2 (4)
TPI Stream using
.BR autopush (8).
.PP
Each module implements the the SNAcP intermediate layer as described in
RFC 1070
.[
rfc1070
.]
and presents a standard CONS NPI interface,
.BR npi (7),
to the user.
Additional modules, such as
.BR tp4 (4)
could be pushed over this Stream to provide ISO Transport Class 4.
.[
ISO/IEC 8073
.]
Since the module must provide a Network Provider Interface to the trasnport
layer, it would be expedient to implement the module over the NP-IP or NP-UDP
pseudo-device drivers, as they use the same service interface.
.PP
A file as described in RFC 1070
.[
rfc1070
.]
to identify first hop ES and IS is required to prime the SNAcP file is
required, and an implementation of RFC 995
.[
rfc995
.]
ES-IS and RFC 1142
.[
rfc1142
.]
IS-IS, are probably also necessary.  The iso-ip and iso-udp probably need to
implement a control Stream usable by an ES-IS daemon implementing RFC 995, and
an IS-IS daemon implementing RFC 1142 is probably also required.
