.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B DLC_ENABLE_SAP
input-output control enables a service access point (SAP).
.PP
A service access point (SAP) identifies a particular user service that sends
and receives a specific class of data.  This user service allows different
classes of data to be routed separately to their corresponding service
handlers.  Those DLCs that support multiple concurrent SAPs have addresses
known as destination SAP and source SAP embedded in thier packet headers.  DLCs
that can only support a single SAP do not need or user SAP addressing, but
still have the concept of enabling the one SAP.  In general, a SAP is enabled
for each DLC on each port.
.PP
Most SAP address values are defined by IEEE standardized network-management
entities or user-defined values are specified.  Some of the common SAP
addresses are:
.TP
.B null SAP (0x00)
Provides some ability to response to remote nodes even when no SAP has been
enabled.  This SAP supports only conenctionless service and responds only to
exchange identification (XID) and test (TEST) PDUs.
.TP
.B SNA path control (0x04)
Denotes the default individual SAP address used by Systems Network Architecture
(SNA) nodes.
.TP
.B PC network NETBIOS (0xf0)
Used for all DLC communication that is driven by Network Basic I/O System
(NETBIOS) emulation.
.TP
.B discovery SAP (0xfc)
Used by the local area network (LAN) name-discovery services.
.TP
.B global SAP (0xff)
Identifies all active SAPs.
.PP
The argument to the
.B DLC_ADDR_FUNC_ADDR
input-output control is a pointer to a
.B dlc_esap_arg

.PP
The
.B dlc_esap_arg
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I gdlc_sap_corr
Contains the generic data link control (GDLC) service access point (SAP)
correlator.  This correlation must accompany all subsequent commands
associated with this SAP.
.TP
.I user_sap_corr
Specifies an identifier or correlator the user wishes to have returned on all
SAP results from GDLC.  It allows theuser of multiple SAPs to choose a
correlator to reout the SAP-specific results.
.TP
.I len_func_addr_mask
Specifies the byte length of the following functional address mask.  This
field must be set to zero (0) if no functional address is required.  Length
values of zero (0) through
.B DLC_MAX_ADDR
are supported.
.TP
.I func_addr_mask
Specifies the functional address mask to be ORed with the functional address
of the adapter.  This address mask allows packets that are destined for
specific functions to be received by the local adapter.  See individual DLC
interface documentation to determine the format and length of this field.
.RS
.IP \fBNote:\fP
GDLC does not distinguish whether a received packet was accepted by the
adapter due to a pre-set network, group or functional address.  If the SAP
address matches and the packet is otherwise valid (no protocol errors, for
instance), the received packet is passed to the user.
.PP
The following protocol-specific considerations apply:
.TP
.B DLC FDDI
The functional address mask field is not supported.
.TP
.B DLC TOKEN
The
.I func_addr_mask
(functional address mask) field must be the logical OR operation with the
functional address on the adapter, which allows packets that are destined for
specified functions to be received by the local adapter.  Only bits 1 through
29 are valid.  Bits 0, 30, and 31 are ignored.  The most significant two bytes
of the full six-byte functional address are automatically compared for 0xC000
by the adapter.
.TP
.B DLC SDLC
The functional address mask field is not supported.
.RE
.TP
.I leng_grp_addr
Specifies the byte length of the following group address.  This field must be
set to zero (0) if no group address is required.  Length values of zero (0)
through
.B DLC_MAX_ADDR
are supported.
.TP
.I grp_addr
Specifies the group address value to be written to the adapter.  It allows
packets that are destined for a specific group to be received by the local
adapter.
.RS
.IP \fBNote:\fP
Most adapters allows only one group address to be active at a time.  If this
field is nonzero and the adapter rejects the group address because it is
already in use, the enable SAP call fails with an appropriate error code.
.PP
The following protocol-specific considerations apply:
.TP
.B DLC FDDI
The
.I grp_addr
field contains the full six-byte group address with the individual control
bits, group control bits, universal control bits, and local control bits
located in the most significant bit positions of the first (lefmost) byte.
.TP
.B DLC TOKEN
The
.I grp_addr
(group address) field for token ring contains the four least significant bytes
of the desired six-byte group address.  Only bits 1 thorugh 31 are valid.  Bit
0 is ignored.  The most significant two bytes are automatically compared for
0xC000 by the adapter.
.TP
.B DLC 8023
The
.I grp_addr
(group address) field is a 6-byte value as specified in the IEEE Standard 802.3
specifications.  Octet
.IR grp_addr [0]
specifies the most significant byte and
.IR grp_addr [5]
the least significant byte.  Each octet of the address field is transmitted,
least significant bit first.  Group addresses sometimes are called multicast
addresses.
.TP
.B DLC ETHER
The
.I grp_addr
(group address) field is a 6-byte value as specified in the IEEE Standard 802.3
specifications.  Octet
.IR grp_addr [0]
specifies the most significant byte and
.IR grp_addr [5]
the least significant byte.  Each octet of the address field is transmitted,
least significant bit first.  Group addresses sometimes are called multicast
addresses.
.TP
.B DLC SDLC
The
.I grp_addr
(group address) field is not supported.
.RE
.TP
.I max_ls
Specifies the maximum number of link stations (LS) allowed to operate
concurrently on a particular SAP.  The protocol used determines the values for
this field.
.RS
.PP
The following protocol specific considerations apply:
.TP
.B DLC FDDI
The maximum link stations field cannot exceed a value of 255.
.TP
.B DLC TOKEN
The
.I max_ls
(maximum link stations) field cannot exceed a value of 255.
.TP
.B DLC 8023
The
.I max_ls
(maximum link stations) field cannot exceed a value of 255.
.TP
.B DLC ETHER
The
.I max_ls
(maximum link stations) field cannot exceed a value of 255.
.TP
.B DLC SDLC
The
.I max_ls
(maximum link stations) field cannot exceed a value of 254 on a multidrop
primary link or a multiple-PU secondary link, and cannot exceed 1 on a
point-to-point link.
.RE
.TP
.I flags
Supports the following flags of the input-output control operation:
.RS
.TP
.B DLC_ESAP_ENCD
Specifies a synchronous data link control (SDLC) serial encoding.
.TP
.B DLC_ESAP_NTWK
The teleprocessing network type.  When this flag is set, it indicates that
the network type is leased line; when clear, the network type is switched.
The default network type is switched.
.TP
.B DLC_ESAP_LINK
The teleprocessing link type.  When this flag is set, it indicates that
the link type is multipoint; when clear, the link type is point-to-point. The
default link type is point-to-point.
.TP
.B DLC_ESAP_PHYC
The physical network call (teleprocessing).  When this flag is set, it
indicates that the SAP is an initiator of calls; when clear, a responder to
calls.
.TP
.B DLC_ESAP_ADDR
The local address or name indicator specifies whether the local address or
name field contains an address or a name.  When this flag is set, it indicates
that the field contains a local address; when clear, a local name.  The
default is a local name.
.TP
.B DLC_ESAP_ANSW
The teleprocessing autocall or autoanswer.  When this flag is set, it
indicates that automatic calls and answers are performed; when clear, that
manual call and answer is required.  The default is manual call and answer.

are supported.
.RS
.PP
The following protocol-specific considerations apply:
.TP
.B DLC FDDI
The
.I laddr_name
(local address or name) field and its associated length are only used for name
discovery when the common SAP field flag
.B DLC_ESAP_ADDR
is set to zero (0).  When resolve parameters are used (the
.B DLC_ESAP_ADDR
flag is set to 1), DLC FDDI obtains the local network address from the device
handler and not from the
.B dl_esap_arg
structure.
.TP
.B DLC TOKEN
The
.I laddr_name
(local address or name) field and its associated length are only used for name
discovery when the common SAP flag
.B DLC_ESAP_ADDR
is clear.  When resolve procedures are used (that is, the
.B DLC_ESAP_ADDR
flag is set), DLC TOKEN obtains the local network address from the device
handler and not from the

discovery when the common SAP flag
.B DLC_ESAP_ADDR
is clear.  When resolve procedures are used (that is, the
.B DLC_ESAP_ADDR
flag is set), DLC TOKEN obtains the local network address from the device
handler and not from the
.B dlc_esap_arg
structure.
.TP
.B DLC SDLC
The
.I laddr_name
(local address or name) filed is not supported, so the length of the local
address/name field is ignored.
.RE
.TP
.I laddr_name
Specifies the unique network name or address of the user local SAP as
indicated by the
.B DLC_ESAP_ADDR
flag.  Some protocols allow the local SAP to be identified by name (for
example, Name-Discovery Services) and others by address (for example, Address
Resolve Procedures).  Other protocols such as Synchronous Data Link Control
(SDLC) do not identify the local SAP.  Check the individual DLC's usage of
this field for the operational protocol.
.TP
.I num_grp_saps
Specifies the number of group SAPs to which the user's local SAP responds.  If
no group SAPs are needed, this field must contain zero (0).  Up to
.B DL_MAX_GSAPS
SAPs can be specified.

Under IEEE terminology, a link station is associated with the MAC entity or a
point-to-point data link endpoint, and one or more service access points (SAP)
are associated with the one link station.  LLC Type 2 supporting link stations
can have associated with them zero or more connections that represent a
connection between a local MAC address and a remote MAC address, a local SAP
and a remote SAP.  LAPB link stations can have associated with them 1
connection that represents a connection between the local and remote stations.

link stations can have associated with them one or more connections that
represent a connection associated with a local and remote SAP (TEI).
