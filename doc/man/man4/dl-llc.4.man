.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a DLPI interface LLC driver for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  What it does it
provides DLPI access to the Linux interface devices, such as Ehternet or
FDDI.  There are several types of encapsulation that can be performed and
this driver supports a number of them.
.PP
When a DLPI stream is opened on this driver it is an unattached Style 2
stream.  The Stream must be attached to a PPA (Physical Point of Appearance)
before it can be bound and messages exchanged.  The information reported in
.BR DL_INFO_ACK (7)
will be meaningless until the Stream is attached to a PPA.  This driver uses
a specialized PPA addressing scheme that is based on the level of access to
the MAC device that is desired (in terms of framing and station or combined
station level), and the Linux device index number.  An input-output control
method is provided for translating between interface names (e.g., "eth0") and
Linux interface index numbers.
.PP
To make the PPA also compatible with other systems, in that the PPA is simply
and index number, this driver provides clone minor device numbers that
provide framing specific interfaces and also supports some of the AIX
input-output controls that will adjust the framing.
.PP
The purpose of this driver is to provide IEEE 802.2 LLC access for SNA, X.25
and OSI CONS and CLNS.  The driver is a non-multiplexing pseudo-device
driver.  If you have DLPI MAC drivers for specific interface cards, use the
drivers from the @code{strxns} package to first make them available to Linux.
.PP
This driver also supports some of the AIX mechanisms, input-output controls
and specifics from the GDLC based drivers DLC8023, DLCETHER, DLCTOKEN,
DLCFDDI, but not DLCSDLC or DLCQLLC.  The latter are provided by a separate
HDLC driver.
