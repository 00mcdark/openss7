.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B MGI-IOCTL
is a definition of the managed objects and measurement and monitoring model for the
.BR mg (4)
driver using defined input-output controls.  The
.BR mg (4)
driver is an implementation of the Media Gateway Interface,
.BR mgi (7).
.B MGI-IOCTL
provides the definition of managed objects for the
.BR mg (4)
driver in accordance with a projecte defined managed object model and monitoring mesaurements and
events model.
.\"
.SS "Protocol Service Interface"
.PP
.B MG
provides the following Stream types:
.TP
.I /dev/mg
This devices provides the
.B MG
protocol services using the
.I MG-primitives
of the Media Gateway Interface (MGI),
.BR mgi (7),
as interpreted for use with switching components.  This interface is suitable both for use with
other
.BR MG (4)
modules and drivers, as well as the
.BR cframe (3)
library using the
.BR OpenSwitch (n)
call framework.
.\"
.SS "Object Model"
.PP
.B MG
provides for management of a number of managed objects.  These objects are of a number of types as
follows:
.TP
.B MG_OBJ_TYPE_DF
The default object.  This object refers to the collection of system-wide defaults.
.TP
.B MG_OBJ_TYPE_MG
A media gateway control object.  This object refers to media gateway control Stream opened on the
upper multiplex.
.TP
.B MG_OBJ_TYPE_SE
A communictions session object.
.TP
.B MG_OBJ_TYPE_LG
A connection leg object.
.TP
.B MG_OBJ_TYPE_CH
A channel object.   This object referes to a channel Stream on the lower multiplex.
This is a specific lower multiplex driver Stream that provides CH services to the MG multiplexing
driver.  The CH Stream is uniquely identified by its multiplex identifier provided by the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem when the CH Stream is linked under the driver using a
.IR I_LINK (7)
or
.IR I_PLINK (7)
operation.
.TP
.B MG_OBJ_TYPE_MX
A multiplex object.  This object refers to a multiplex connection Stream on the lower mutliplex.
This is a specific lower multiplex driver Stream that provides MX services to the MG multiplexing
driver.  The MX Stream is uniquely identified by its multiplex identifier provided by the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem when the MX Stream is linked under the driver using a
.IR I_LINK (7)
or
.IR I_PLINK (7)
operation.
.\"
.SS "Management Attributes"
.PP
Each object has associated with it information in the following categories:
.TP
.I Configuration
All of the primary attributes necessary and sufficient for the creation of each object.
.TP
.I Timers
Timers associated with each object.
.TP
.I Options
Options (not necessary for creation) for each object.
.TP
.I State
The state of each object.
.TP
.I Statistics
Statistis associated with each object class in accordance with specifications.
.TP
.I Events
Events associated with each object.  This includes both management events and monitoring events.
.TP
.I Controls
Management controls applicable to each object.
.PP
Each object class is described in each category in the sections below.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All objects must be configured using
.IR I_STR (7)
.BR streamio (7)
input-output control commands before they are usable.

.TP
.I type
specifies the object type.  See object types under
.RI \(lq "Object Model" ,\(rq
above.
.TP
.I id
specifies the object identifier that identifies the object instance within the object type.  When
the operation is
.BR MG_ADD ,
this field can be set to zero
.RB ( 0 )
and
.BR mg (4)
will select a new unique object identifier.  When the operation is
.BR MG_GET ,
this field can be set to zero
.RB ( 0 )
and
.BR mg (4)
will return all object configuration of a type that will fit into the supplied buffer.
.TP
.I cmd
specifies the command.  This field can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B MG_GET
Get configuration of an object.
This command is only valid with input-output control
.BR MG_IOCGCONFIG .
.TP
.B MG_ADD
Add an object.
This command is not valid with input-output control
.BR MG_IOCGCONFIG .
.TP
.B MG_CHA
Change an object.
This command is not valid with input-output control
.BR MG_IOCGCONFIG .
.TP
.B MG_DEL
Delete an object.
This command is not valid with input-output control
.BR MG_IOCGCONFIG .
.RE
.PP
Input-output controls used to issue configuration commands are as follows:
.TP
.B MG_IOCGCONFIG
Get an object configuration.
.TP
.B MG_IOCSCONFIG
Set an object configuration.  This command may fail if an object is busy or cannot be allocated.
.TP
.B MG_IOCTCONFIG
Test an object configuration.
.TP
.B MG_IOCCCONFIG
Commit an object configuration.  This command will not fail if an object is busy.
.PP
The structures required to specify configuration are as follows (in order of dependency):
.\"
.SS "Default"
.PP
Although a configuration structure is defined for the default object, there is no need to create or
configure the default object.  This object is configured at the time that the
.BR mg (4)
driver module loads.
