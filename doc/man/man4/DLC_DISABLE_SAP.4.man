.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B DLC_DISABLE_SAP
input-output control disables a service access point (SAP).
.PP
A service access point (SAP) identifies a particular user service that sends
and receives a specific class of data.  This user service allows different
classes of data to be routed separately to their corresponding service
handlers.  Those DLCs that support multiple concurrent SAPs have addresses
known as destination SAP and source SAP embedded in thier packet headers.  DLCs
that can only support a single SAP do not need or user SAP addressing, but
still have the concept of enabling the one SAP.  In general, a SAP is enabled
for each DLC on each port.
.PP
Most SAP address values are defined by IEEE standardized network-management
entities or user-defined values are specified.  Some of the common SAP
addresses are:
.TP
.B null SAP (0x00)
Provides some ability to response to remote nodes even when no SAP has been
enabled.  This SAP supports only conenctionless service and responds only to
exchange identification (XID) and test (TEST) PDUs.
.TP
.B SNA path control (0x04)
Denotes the default individual SAP address used by Systems Network Architecture
(SNA) nodes.
.TP
.B PC network NETBIOS (0xf0)
Used for all DLC communication that is driven by Network Basic I/O System
(NETBIOS) emulation.
.TP
.B discovery SAP (0xfc)
Used by the local area network (LAN) name-discovery services.
.TP
.B global SAP (0xff)
Identifies all active SAPs.
.PP
The argument to the
.B DLC_ADDR_FUNC_ADDR
input-output control is a pointer to a
.B dlc_corr_arg
structure, formatted as follows:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
struct dlc_corr_arg {
    uint32_t gdlc_sap_corr;
    uint32_t gdlc_ls_corr;
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
The
.B dlc_corr_arg
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I gdlc_sap_corr
Contains the generic data link control (GDLC) service access point (SAP)
correlator to be disabled.
.TP
.I gdlc_ls_corr
Contains the generic data link control (GDLC) link station (LS) correlator.  The
GDLC LS correlator is returned to the user as soon as resources are determined
to be available.  This correlator must accompany all commands associated with
this LS.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success, the input-output control returns zero (0).  Upon failure, the
input-output control returnes minus one (-1) and sets
.BR errno (3)
to an appropriate error code.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When the input-output control fails, it returns minus one (-1) and set the
.BR errno (3)
to an appropriate error code.  In addition to the reasons given in
.BR ioctl (2s),
this input-output control can fail because of the following:
.TP \w'[\fBEDEADLK\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
A parameter of the input-output control is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
A memory extent exceeds the callers valid address space.
.TP
.RB [ EPROTO ]
A rule of the interface protocol was violated.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
The operation could not be immediately processed.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
There were insufficient message buffers to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
There were insufficient STREAMS resources to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
There was insufficient memory to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ EDEADLK ]
A deadlock condition was detected and avoided.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that
.IR AIX \(rg
terminology for GDLC conflict with that of LLC
.[
iso/iec 8802-2 : 1998
.]
and LAPB.
.[
iso7776
.]
Under IEEE terminology, a link station is associated with the MAC entity or a
point-to-point data link endpoint, and one or more service access points (SAP)
are associated with the one link station.  LLC Type 2 supporting link stations
can have associated with them zero or more connections that represent a
connection between a local MAC address and a remote MAC address, a local SAP
and a remote SAP.  LAPB link stations can have associated with them 1
connection that represents a connection between the local and remote stations.
LAPD
.[
q921
.]
link stations can have associated with them one or more connections that
represent a connection associated with a local and remote SAP (TEI).
LAPF
.[
q922
.]
link stations can have associated with them one or more connections that
represent a connection associated with a local and remote SAP (DLCI).
.PP
.IR AIX \(rg
terminology in the GDLC documentation refers to this latter connection,
confusingly, as a link station (LS).
The
.IR AIX \(rg
GDLC service access point (SAP) is really a Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) and
DLSAP combination under the DLPI,
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
and the
.IR AIX \(rg
GDLC link station (LS) is really a connection identifier.
It may be helpful to think of a GDLC link station (LS) as an identifier of a
local and remote link station combination for a given DLSAP.
.PP
.B DLC_DISABLE_SAP
is an
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
input-output control.
It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.B _AIX_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >,
.RB < sys/dlpi_ext.h >,
or
.RB < sys/dlpi_ioctl.h >
header files to expose the definitions, structures and declarations associated
with the input-output control.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The

input-output control is compatible with
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[

and implementations based on
.IR AIX \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:

.B DLC_DISABLE_SAP
is an
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
input-output control that is not part of the DLPI standard.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
It should not be used by portable DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
.B DLC_DISABLE_SAP
is provided by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
for source compatibility with DLS Providers and Users written for use with
.IR AIX \(rg,
and for porting DLS Providers and Users from

Binary compatibility is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced
may be removed from a future release.
