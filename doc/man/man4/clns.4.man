.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B CLNS
is an implementation of X.213
.[
x213
.]
Connectionless Network Service (CLNS).
.PP
There are several ways of providing the ISO CLNS as follows:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The classical way is using
X.25 as described in X.622.
.[
x622
.]
.IP 2.
Another way is providing CLNS over X.25, but providing X.25 using an X.25 over
TCP protocol such as
.BR xot (4)
as described in RFC 1613,
.[
rfc1613
.]
or a similar SCTP protocol.
.IP 3.
Also, CLNS can be provided directly over IP,
.BR iso-ip (4),
as described in RFC 1070.
.[
rfc1070
.]
.IP 4.
CLNS can be provided over UDP,
.BR iso-udp (4),
as also described in RFC 1070.
.[
rfc1070
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
A user of the CLNS service opens a pseudo-device driver by opening the clone
device
.BR /dev/clns .
This yields a CLNS Stream.  When the user binds the Stream to a local NSAP,
the form of the NSAP determines which of the underlying protocols are used to
provide service to the CLNS Stream.
.PP
A CLNS Stream is associated with an underlying provider in the following
fashion:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
When the CLNS Stream is bound, using the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive, the driver uses the NSAP to determine whether a suitable provider
exists, and if it does, the Stream is associated with the provider.  If a
suitable provider does not yet exist, a request is issued to a connection
manager daemon (CLNS CM) listening on the connection managemnt (CM) Stream.
.IP \(bu
The CLNS CM satisfies a request by opening a provider Stream of the
appropriate type, binding it and linking it under the CLNS multiplexing
driver.  It responds to the request with the multiplexer identifier that was
returned from the
.BR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
operation to identify the provider Stream to the CLNS driver.
.IP ""
If an error occurs while attempting to open and bind the provider Stream, the
CLNS CM will respond with a negative acknowledgement on the CM Stream and the
CLNS driver will transform the negative acknowledgement into an appropriate
.BR N_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive that is issued to the CLNS User.
.IP \(bu
The connection manager satisfies specific requests by examining the NSAP
contained in the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive, and using information concerning routing and the reachability of
addresses.  The NSAP can be one of 3 forms:
.IP ""
.RS
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
An X.121
.[
x121
.]
or other X.25 address (e.g. ISDN).
The CLNS CM opens the appropriate X.25 PLP,
.BR plp (4),
or other connection oriented Stream (e.g, ISDN) binds and connects the Stream
and then links it under the CLNS multiplexing driver.
.IP 2.
A Internet NSAP per RFC 1069
.[
rfc1069
.]
without a TCP/IP port number.
The CLNS CM opens a
.BR rawip (4)
driver, pushes the
.BR iso-ip (4)
module onto the Stream (or opens a rawip device that autopushes iso-ip), and
binds the Stream appropriately and links it under the CLNS multiplexing
driver.
.IP 3.
A Internet NSAP per RFC 1069
.[
rfc1069
.]
including a TCP/IP port number.
The CLNS CM opens a
.BR udp (4)
driver, pushes the
.BR iso-udp (4)
module onto the Stream (or opens a udp device that autopushes iso-udp), and
binds the Stream appropriately and links it under the CLNS multiplexing
driver.
.RE
.IP \(bu
The CLNS CM can distinguish further between requested provider using
information from the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive, so long as the linked Stream used to satisfy the request provides
the ISO Connectionless Network Service defined by X.213
.[
x213
.]
using the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7).
(Examples are ISO DL SNCF
.[
x623
.]
and ISDN
.[[\fB
x625
.]\fR].)
.IP \(bu
Provider Streams may also be linked under the CLNS multiplexing driver at
configuration time using static configuration information obtained from
configuration files.  (For example the
.BR /etc/eno_es
and
.BR /etc/eno_is
files.)
.IP \(bu
Provider Streams may also be linked under the CLNS multiplexing driver as the
result of routing discovery protocols or interface changes.  (An example of
routing discovery protocols are the ES-IS,
.[
iso/iec 9542 : 1988
.]
.[
rfc995
.]
IS-IS,
.[
iso/iec 10589 : 1992
.]
.[
rfc1142

and IRDP
.[
iso/iec 10747 : 1992

protocols.)

.SH INTERFACE
.PP
The CLNS User interface on the upper multiplex is the Network Provider
Interace (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
supporting the Connectionless Service (CLNS) of the ISO Network Service
Interface, X.213.
.[
x213
.]
.PP
The CLNS Provider interface on the lower multiplex is the Network
Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
supporting either the Connectionless Service (CLNS) or Connection-Oriented
Service (CONS) of the ISO Network Service Interface, X.213.
.[
x213
.]
.PP
The CLNS CM (Connection Management) interface on the connection management
(CM) Stream is a specialised interface specific to the CLNS driver, but is
based on the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
supporting the ISO Network Service Interface, X.213.
.[
x213
.]
Details of this interface are described under
.RI \(lq PRIMITIVES \(rq,
below.
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSES
.PP
CLNS supports the addresses and NSAPs identified in X.213,
.[
x213
.]
as discussed in X.233.
.[
x233
.]
This address can take multiple forms including the Internet NSAP form as
described in RFC 1069,
.[
rfc1069
.]
RFC 1277
.[
rfc1277
.]
or RFC 4548.
.[
rfc4548
.]
The later form of the NSAP is used to distinguish the need for an ISO Network
Service supported over IP,
.BR iso-ip (4),
UDP,
.BR iso-udp (4)
or SCTP,
.BR iso-sctp (4).
Addresses are NSAP addresses (initial octet and 20-byte address) used on
public X.25 networks or a null NSAP for the null network service for private
networks (then only the SNAP address is used).  See the CLNS specification.
.[
x233
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
CLNS User Streams support the full set of Quality of Service parameters are
specified in the CLNS specification X.213;
.[
x213
.]
however, negotiation of Quality of Service paramters is performed between the
CLNS User and the underlying NS provider.  Therfore, QOS parameters supported
to the CLNS User is dependent upon the QOS support of the underlying provider.
.\"
.\"
.SH PRIMITIVES
.PP
Primitives supported by the CLNS User Streams are the full set of OSI
conforming Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
primitives supporting Connectionless Network Service (CLNS).
.PP
CLNS CM Streams support a specialised set of primitives, based on NPI
primitives, that provide the ability for the CLNS CM to receive requests for
new providers as well as the ability to indicate the result of those
requests.
.PP
CLNS CM requests and responses are formatted as follows:
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct clns_mgmt {
    np_ulong cm_user;           /* User index */
    np_ulong cm_prov;           /* Provider index */
    union N_primitives cm_prim; /* Primitive */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'\fIcm_user\fR\(em'u
.I cm_user
is the user index.  The user index identifies the CLNS User that originated
the request.
.TP
.I cm_prov
is the provider index.  The provider index identifies a CONS or CLNS provider
that will satisfy the request.
an
.BR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
operation that was used to link the Stream under the CLNS multiplexing driver.
.TP
.I cm_prim
is the primitive.  The exact format of the primitive and the size of the
remainder of the structure can be determined by the
.I cm_prim.type
field of the
.B N_primitives
union.  The
.B N_primitives
union is defined in the
.RB < sys/npi.h >
header file.
.PP
The
.B clns_mgmt
structure is contained in the control part
.RB ( M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9)
message block) of the request or response.
Any data is contained in the data part
.RB ( M_DATA (9)
message blocks) of the request or response.  The type of the command is
determined from the
.I cm_prim.type
field in the
.B clns_mgmt
structure.
The
.B clns_mgmt
structure is defined in the
.RB < sys/clns.h >
header file.
.PP
Overloaded primitives are as follows:
.TP
.B Bind Request
The bind request is issued to the CLNS CM on the CM Stream when a suitable
provider could not be found to satisfy a CLNS User bind request,
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7).
This primitive requires an acknowledgement by the CLNS CM with
either a bind acknowledgement or an error acknowledgement.
.RS
.TP \w'\fIcm_user\fR\(em'u
.I cm_user
Indicates the index within the CLNS driver of the CLNS User at which the
request originated.  This is an opaque identifier that the CLNS CM uses in the
bind or error acknowledgement to identify the transaction.
.TP
.I cm_prov
Ignored in the bind request.
.TP
.I cm_prim
Contains the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive as it was issued by the CLNS User.
.RE
.TP
.B Bind Acknowledgement
The bind acknowledgement is issued by the CLNS CM on the CM
Stream when a suitable provider has been bound and linked beneath the CLNS
multiplexing driver.
.RS
.TP \w'\fIcm_user\fR\(em'u
.I cm_user
Specifies the user index from the corresponding bind request.
.TP
.I cm_prov
Specifies the multiplexer identifier (returned by the
.BR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
operation) that identifies the provider Stream to which the bind ocurred.
.TP
.I cm_prim
Contains the
.BR N_BIND_ACK (7)
primitive as it should be issued to the CLNS User.
.RE
.TP
.B Error Acknowledgement
The error acknowledgement is issued by the CLNS CM on the CM Stream when the
bind to the provider was not possible and resulted in an error.
.RS
.TP \w'\fIcm_user\fR\(em'u
.I cm_user
Specifies the user index from the corresponding bind request.
.TP
.I cm_prov
Specifies the provider index from the corresponding bind request.
.TP
.I cm_prim
Contains the
.B N_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive as it should be issued to the CLNS User.
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
CLNS Streams do not support any CLNS-specific input-output controls.  The CLNS
CM Stream supports the
.BR I_LINK "(7), " I_PLINK "(7), " I_UNLINK "(7) and " I_PUNLINK (7)
.I STREAMS
input-output controls described under
.BR streamio (7).
When a CLNS CM links a provider Stream under the multiplexing driver using
.BR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7),
the CLNS driver determines the characteristics of the provider by issuing a
.BR N_INFO_REQ (7)
primitive on the provider Stream and processing the
.BR N_INFO_ACK (7)
response.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that the CLNS driver does not perform ES-IS, IS-IS or IDRP routing.  It
only matches CLNS User Stream from the upper multiplex to provider Streams on
the lower multiplex.  An external program must open ES-IS, IS-IS or IDRP
Streams and establish routing within the CLNS driver using routing Stream
input-output control commands.
.PP
Note that wehn the CLNS CM opens a CONS Stream and binds or connects it using
the
.BR N_BIND_REQ "(7) or " N_CONN_REQ (7)
primitive, that this may invoke a connection manager for the provider Stream
to open other Streams for use by the provider.  For example, binding or
connecting an X.25
.BR plp (4)
Stream may result in the formation of a
.BR tcp (4)
connection using the
.BR xot (4)
protocol to provide the VS required for the provider.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
CLNS can be implemented over LLC1 or over X.25 LAPB.  For Ethernet, LLC1 is
used (SNAP header) for sending CLNS datagrams directory over Ethernet or IEEE
802 LANs.  For X.25 LAPB, an X.25 SVC can be set up and used for transporting
CLNS encapsulated in X.25 Layer 3 messages.  An ES-IS, RFC 995
.[
rfc995
.]
and IS-IS, RFC 1142
.[
rfc1142
.]
routing mechanism is required.  For LLC the SNAP address is the MAC address
and the ES-IS or IS-IS protocol can be encapsulated and broadcast.  For
X.25 LAPB either the ES-IS or IS-IS protocol can be encapsulated and sent to
the adjacent node.
.PP
A mechanism is required for an ES-IS daemon and an IS-IS daemon and network
configuration to configure subnetworks and point-to-point connections under
the domain of the ES-IS and IS-IS daemon.
