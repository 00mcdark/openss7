.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B CD-DAED
is an implementation of the Delimination Aligment and Error Detection (DAED) Procedures as specified
in
.B ITU-T Q.703
.[
q703
.]
and
.BR "ANSI T1.111.3" .
.[
t1.111
.]
.B CD-DAED
is intended to be used with the
.BR xxx (4)
multiplexing driver.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B CD-DAED
is implementated as a pushable
.IR STREAMS (4)
module.  The
.B CD-DAED
module can be pushed over a stream conforming to the Channel Interface (CHI) as described in
.BR chi (7).
The
.B CD-DAED
module provides DAED acces to the bit stream from the channel provided by the
.BR chi (7)
Stream below it, by performing HDLC and DAED functions on the raw bit stream.  The upper interface
provided by the
.B CD-DAED
module is the Communications Device Interface (CDI) as described in
.BR cdi (7).
.PP
.B CD-DAED
Streams can be linked under
.BR cd (4)
drivers
.BR xxx (4),
using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide a complete Communications Device that can then be linked under a
.BR dl (4)
driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide data link services to the Layer 3 protocol.  This is normally performed, as required, by
the SS7 Configuration Daemon,
.BR ss7confd (8).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B CD-DAED
has been implemented as a pushable module to ease the development of SS7 Communications Device
and Data Link drivers for various hardware cards.  All that is required is for the card to provide a
Channel Interface (CHI),
.BR chi (7),
and push the
.BR cd-daed
.BR hdlc (4)
and
.BR dl (4)
modules to provide a complete and compliant SS7 Signalling Link.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B CD-DAED
is implemented internally as a soft-HDLC using host-based table lookups.  While this is fairly
efficient, devices that are capable of performing this function in hardware should provide the
Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.BR cdi (7),
directly.
An example of a device that does not include HDLC is the
.BR x400p (4)
driver.  An examle of one that does, is the
.BR acb56 (4)
driver.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B CD-DAED
modules are not normally pushed or accessed directly by user-level programs.
The
.B CD-DAED
module is used directly by some test and monitoring programs.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
The
.B CD-DAED
module responsds to Local Management Interface (LMI),
.BR lmi_ioctl (4),
IO controls as interpreted for
.B CD-DAED
operations as described in
.BR daed_ioctl (4).
