.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B M3UA
is an implementation of the SS7 MTP3 User Adaptation Layer (M3UA) defined in
RFC 3332,
.[
rfc3332
.]
TS 102 142,
.[
ts 102 142
.]
and
RFC 4666.
.[
rfc4666
.]
.B M3UA
provides a back haul of the services of the
.BR mtp (4)
over an IP network using Stream Control Transmission Protocol,
.BR sctp (4),
as defined in
RFC 2960,
.[
rfc2960
.]
RFC 3309,
.[
rfc3309
.]
TS 102 144,
.[
ts 102 144
.]
and
RFC 4460.
.[
rfc4460
.]
Also, it provides a building block for redundant and distributed SS7
systems.  (See
.IR \*(lqNOTICES\*(rq ,
below.)
.PP
.B M3UA
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR mtp "(4) or " sctp (4)
streams are linked under the
.BR M3UA
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLIHK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide transport or direct MTP services
.[
q704
.]
.[
mtpv1
.]
.[
t1.111
.]
.[
jtq704
.]
to
.BR M3UA .
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR m3ua_ioctl (4).
.PP
.B M3UA
provides the following stream types that are directly compatible with the
stream types provided by
.BR mtp (4).
To select one of these stream types,
.I device
can be one of the following:
.TP
.I /dev/m3ua
This device provides the
.B MTP
protocol service interface using the M-primitives of the Message Transfer Part
Interface described in
.BR mtpi (7).
This interface is suitable for use with other SS7 modules and drivers.
.TP
.IR /dev/m3ua-npi-cl ", " /dev/m3ua-npi-co
This devices provides the
.BR MTP
protocol service interface using the N-primitives of the Network Provider
Interface,
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
used for the Message Transfer Part as described in
.BR npi_mtp (7).
The
.BR npi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with
the
.BR sockets (3)
library
.RB socket (3)
call
and provides the
.B MTP
interface using sockets as described in
.BR mtp_socket (7).
.I /dev/m3ua-npi-cl
provides a connectionless
.B N_CLNS
network service provider;
.I /dev/m3ua-npi-co
provides a connection-oriented
.B N_CONS
network service provider.
.TP
.IR /dev/m3ua-tpi-cl ", " /dev/m3ua-tpi-co
This device provides the
.B MTP
protocol service interface using the T-primitives of the
Transport Provider Interface,
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0 draft 2
.]
.BR tpi (7),
user for the Message Transfer Part as described in
.BR tpi_mtp (7).
The
.BR tpi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with
the
.BR xnet (3)
or
.BR xti (3)
library
.BR t_open (3)
call and provides the
.B MTP
interface using XTI
.[
xti revision 1.0
.]
.[
xns99
.]
as described in
.BR xti_mtp (3).
.I /dev/m3ua-tpi-cl
provides a connectionless
.B T_CLNS
transport service provider;
.I /dev/m3ua-tpi-co
provides a pseudo-connection-oriented
.B T_CONS
transport service provider.
.PP
.B M3UA
provides two socket types used by the
.BR sockets (3)
library
.BR socket (3)
call.
.B M3UA
provides sockets in the protocol family
.B PF_SS7
using the protocol number
.BR SS7PROTO_M3UA .
The
.I socket_type
argument can be one of the following:
.TP
.B SOCK_RDM
Provides a connectionless datagram service with reliable delivery including
retransmission.  Message boundaaries are preserved.
This socket uses the underlying
.I /dev/m3ua-tpi-cl
transport service provider.
.TP
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET
Provides a pseudo-connection-oriented packet service with reliable delivery
including retransmission.  Message boundaries are preserved.  Messages can be
sent and received in order.
This socket uses the underlying
.I /dev/m3ua-tpi-co
transport service provider.
.PP
The following entries in
.B /etc/sock2path
provide the information necessary for
.BR socksys (4)
to use these devices:
.sp
.TS
tab(:);
llllll.
PF_SS7:SOCK_RDM:SS7PROTO_M3UA:/dev/m3ua-tpi-cl:tpi:clts

.BR sock2path (5).

.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B M3UA
can be configured on a system as a drop in transparent replacement for
.BR mtp (4).
In such a configuration, users opening streams or sockets as defined in
.BR mtp (4)
will be opening
.B m3ua
streams and sockets, but will be unaware of the difference.  In
.BR OpenSS7 ,
.B m3ua
is used as the primary mechanism of redundancy and distribution at the
.B MTP
level, and, when properly configured (see
.BR ss7confd (8)),
.B m3ua
functions transparently to the MTP-User.
.PP
Also, opening and binding a
.B m3ua
stream or socket may result in the opening and binding of a
.BR mtp (4)
stream on the local or remote host in direct support of the local MTP-User.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2s)
system calls on the
.I m3ua_stream
or
.IR m3ua_socket .
These management controls are documented in
.BR m3ua_ioctl (4).
