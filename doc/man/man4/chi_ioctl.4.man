.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B CHI-IOCTL
is a definition of the managed objects and measurement and monitoring model
for the
.BR ch (4)
driver using defined input-output controls.  The
.BR ch (4)
driver is an implementation of the Channel Interface,
.BR chi (7).
.B CHI-IOCTL
provides the definition of managed objects for the
.BR ch (4)
driver in accordance with a project defined managed object model and
monitoring measurements and events model.
.SS "Protocol Service Interface"
.PP
.B CH
provides the following Stream types:
.TP
.I /dev/ch
This device provides the
.B CH
protocol services using the
.I CH-primitives
of the Channel Interface (CHI),
.BR chi (7),
as intepreted for use with switching components.  This interface is suitable
both for use with other
.BR CH (4)
modules and drivers, as well as the
.BR cframe (3)
library using the
.BR OpenSwitch (n)
call framework.
.SS "Object Model"
.PP
.B CH
provides for management of a number of managed objects.  These objects are of
a number of types as follows:
.TP
.B CH_OBJ_TYPE_DF
The default object.  This object refers to the collection of system-wide
defaults.
.TP
.B CH_OBJ_TYPE_CH
A channel object.  This object refers to a channel Stream on the lower
multiplex.  This is a specific lower multiplex driver Stream that provides CH
services to the CH multiplexing driver.  The CH Stream is uniquely identified
by its multiplex identifier provided by the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem when the CH Stream is linked under the driver using an
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
operation.
.TP
.B CH_OBJ_TYPE_MX
A multiplex object.  This object refers to a multiplex connection Stream on
the lower multiplex.  This is a specific lower multiplex driver Stream that
provides MX services to the CH multiplexing driver.  The MX Stream is uniquely
identified by its multiplex identifier provided by the
.IR STREAMS (9)
subsystem when the MX Stream is linked under the driver using an
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
operation.
.SS "Management Attributes"
.PP
Each object has associated with it information in the following categories:
.TP
.I Configuration
All of the primary attributes necessary and sufficient for the creation of
each object.
.TP
.I Timers
Timers associated with each object.
.TP
.I Options
Options (not necessary for creation) for each object.
.TP
.I State
The state of each object.
.TP
.I Statistics
Statistics associated with each object class in accordance with
specifications.
.TP
.I Events
Events associated with each object.  This includes both management events and
monitoring events.
.TP
.I Controls
Management controls applicable to each object.
.PP
Each object class is described in each category in the sections below.
.\"

All objects must be configured using
.IR I_STR (7)
.BR streamio (7)
input-output control commands before they are usable.
