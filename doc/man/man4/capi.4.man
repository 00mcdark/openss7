.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B CAPI
is an implementation of the COMMON-ISDN-API (CAPI).
The purpose of the
.B CAPI
driver is twofold:
.RS
.IP 1. 4
to provide the Call Control Interface (CCI) to
.B Linux
CAPI devices.
.IP 2.
to provide CAPI capabilities to
.BR OpenSS7 \(tm
Call Control Interface (CCI) ISDN devices.
.RE
.PP
.B CAPI
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR isdn (4)
streams are linked under the
.B CAPI
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide CAPI access to
.BR isdn (4)
devices.  Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR capi_ioctl (4)
IO controls.  This function is normally performed by the ISDN configuration
daemon,
.BR isdnconfd (8).
See also,
.BR isdn (8).
.PP
In addition, the
.B CAPI
driver provides on-demand access to CAPI devices using the Call Control
Interface (CCI),
.BR cci (7)
integrated for CAPI as described in
.BR cci_capi (7),
the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) described in
.BR dlpi (7),
and the Multiplex Interface (MXI) described in
.BR mxi (7).
This is performed internally using the
.B Linux
kernel CAPI interface.
.PP
.B CAPI
provides the following stream types.  To select one of the stream types, the
.I device
argument to the
.BR open (2s)
call can be one of the following:
.TP
.I /dev/capi
This device provides a
.IR UNIX \(rg
based CAPI 2.0 interface using
.IR STREAMS (4).
This device provides the CAPI 2.0 interface described in the COMMON-ISDN-API
Part III for the
.IR UNIX \(rg
operating system.
This device can be used to access both
.IR Linux \(rg
CAPI devices as well as
.BR OpenSS7 \(tm
ISDN devices using the COMMON-ISDN-API Version 2.0.
.TP
.I /dev/capi-cci
This device provides the CAPI protocol services using the CC-primitives of the
Call Control Interface (CCI) described in
.BR cci (7),
as interpreted for use with
.B CAPI
as described in
.BR cci_capi (7).
This interface is suitable both for use with other SS7 modules and drivers, as
well as with the
.BR cframe (3)
library using the
.B OpenSwitch
call framework.
.TP
.I /dev/capi-dl
This devices provides CAPI protocol services using the DL-primitives of the
Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) described in
.BR dlpi (7).
This interface is equivalent to the
.BR dl (4)
driver for
.BR ISDN (4),
for CAPI devices that are capable of providing direct access to D-channel
signalling.  This permits the CAPI device to be linked under the
.BR isdn (4)
multiplexing driver for use in the
.BR OpenSS7 \(tm
.BR ISDN (4)
stack.
.TP
.I /dev/capi-ch
This device provides
.B CAPI
device bearer channel access using the CH-primitives of the Channel Interface
described in
.BR chi (7).
This interface is suitable for use with
.BR MG (4)
Media Gateway drivers, or to be used directly as a channel for other drivers
and modules.
.TP
.I /dev/capi-mx
This device provides
.B CAPI
device bearer channel access using the MX-primitives of the Multiplex
Interface described in
.BR mxi (7).
This interface is suitable for use with
.BR MG (4)
Media Gateway drivers, or to be used directly as a multiplex for other drivers
and modules.
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Not all Linux CAPI devices are necessarily able to provide direct D-channel access.
Those Linux CAPI devices that are capable of direct D-channel access are best used
via the DLPI interface
.RI ( /dev/capi-dl )
and linked under a
.BR isdn (4)
multiplexing driver.
.PP
Linux CAPI devices that are not capable of direct D-channel access are best
used via the CCI interface
.RI ( /dev/capi-cci )
and used directly.
.SH BUGS
.PP
This driver has not yet been written.
