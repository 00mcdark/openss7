\- SS7 Q.703 Signalling Link
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stropts.h>

.B #include <ss7/sli.h>
.br
.B #include <ss7/sli_ioctl.h>
.HP
.BI "int " retval " = ioctl(" sdt_stream ", " \fRI_PUSH\fI ", " \fR\*(lqsl\*(rq\fI );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B SL
is an implementation of the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) Signalling Link (SL)
as specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.703.
.PP
.B SL
is implemented as a pushable
.IR STREAMS (4)
module.  The
.B SL
module can be pushed over streams conforming to the Signalling Data Terminal
Interface (SDTI) as described in
.BR sdti (7),
such as channels upon which the
.BR sdt (4)
module has been pushed.  The
.B SL
provides signalling link access to a signalling terminal provided by the
.BR sdti (7)
stream below it, by performing the MTP Level 2 state machine functions.
The upper interface provided by the
.B SL
module is the Signalling Link Interface (SLI) as described in
.BR sli (7).
.PP
.B SL
streams provide a complete signalling link that can be linked under a
.BR mtp (4)
or
.BR m2ua (4)
driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide signalling link services to the Level 3 protocol.  This is normally
performed, as required, by the SS7 Configuraiton Daemon,
.BR ss7confd (8).
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B SL
has ben implemented as a pushable module to ease the development of SS7
Signalling Link drivers for various cards.  All that is required is for the card
to provide a Channel Interface (CHI),
.BR chi (7),
Signalling Data Link Interface (SDLI),
.BR sdli (7),
or Signalling Data Terminal Interface (SDTI),
.BR sdti (7),
and push the appropriate modules such as
.BR sdl (4),
.BR sdt (4),
and
.BR sl (4),
to provide a complete and compliant SS7 Signalling Link.
.PP
.B SL
modules are not normally pushed or access directly by user-level programs.
The
.B SL
module is used directly by some test and monitoring programs.
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
The
.B SL
module responds to Local Management Interface (LMI),
.BR lmi_ioctl (4),
IO controls as interpreted for
.BR SL
operation as described in
.BR sli_ioctl (4).

.SH VERSIONS
.PP
The
.B SL
module conforms to the SLI Specification, Revision 0.8.2.
.PP
The
.B SL
module first appeared in
.B strss7
release 0.7.6.
