.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B sl-mux
is a Signalling Link multiplexing driver.  The purpose of the driver is to consolidate signalling
link streams from a wide range of drivers and provide common naming, addressing, management and
monitoring procedures for signalling links.
.PP
.B sl-mux
is used in conjunction with a Signalling Link configuration utility and the Signalling Link
configuration daemon,
.BR slconfd (8).
.PP
The configuration utility is responsible for opening, configuring, and attaching Signalling Link
streams from an associated drivers and linking them under the
.B sl-mux
multiplexing driver.  This makes signalling links from a number of drivers available for use through
the single
.B sl-mux
multiplexing driver.  Configuration utilities exist for each type of Signalling Link provider.  For
example, the
.BR x400p-ss7 (4)
driver uses a configuration utility called
.BR x400pconf (8);
.BR m2pa (4),
.BR m2paconf (8);
etc.
.PP
The Signalling Link configuration daemon,
.BR slconfd (8),
is responsible for the general configuration of Signalling Links and performing common
administration (such as management, configuration, monitoring, statistics collection and event
reporting).
.PP
The facilities provided by the
.B sl-mux
multiplexing driver are as follows:
.\"
.SS Addressing
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
provides a global addressing mechanism for addressing signalling links.  There
are three addressing mechanisms provided by the driver:
.TP
.B Global PPA
A Physical Point of Attachment addressing mechanism that is global to the
host.  Each signalling link stream is assigned a 32-bit PPA that is unique to
the host platform.  There is no restrictions on the internal form of the PPA,
merely that it be unique for each signalling link.  The
.BR slconf (5)
configuration file provides a mechanism whereby the system administrator can
assign arbitrary PPA addresses to signalling links from multiple drivers.
.TP
.B CLEI
A Common Language Equipment Identifier (ascii string) addressing mechanism that
is global across all platforms.  This is the Telcordia/Bellcore standard
mechanism for naming equipment.  The driver does not impose a restriction on
the CLEI string, only that the string be unique for each signalling link, and
that the string be no longer than 32 characters in length.
.TP
.B Minor Device Number
The minor device numbers 11 through 4106 can be opened an obtain individual
Style I SL Streams.  These minor device number correspond to device 1 through
4096 (simply add 10 to the device number to arrive at the character minor
device number).
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver permits Style I signalling link streams to be opened; or, Style II
signalling link streams to be opened and attached to specific signalling links
using either the PPA or CLEI as an address for attachment.  See
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7).
Style I Streams are obtained by opening character minor device number 11
through 4106 corresponding to unit 1 through 4096.
Style II Streams are obtained by opening character minor device number zero
.RB ( /dev/sl ),
which is a clone minor device.
.PP
Linking of signalling link streams beneath the multiplexing driver is
performed by the Signalling Link configuration daemon,
.BR slconfd (8).
The daemon opens the administrative minor device,
.IR /dev/sl-admin ,
and then opens signalling link streams on various drivers according to the
configuration specified in a configuration file,
.BR slconf (5),
attaches and configures the streams.  The daemon then links the SL streams
under the
.B sl-mux
driver using the
.IR I_PLINK (7)
input-output control.  It then uses the
.B SLM_IOCSPPA
input-output control to associate a global PPA and CLEI with the linked
stream.  The daemon does this for each and every signalling link stream that
is to be linked under the driver.
.\"
.SS Configuration
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver provides the ability to perform configuration and administration of
signalling links.  This is accomplished by opening a specialized minor device
number of the driver,
.IR /dev/sl-admin .
Using modified
.BR sl_ioctl (4)
signalling link input-output controls, the administrative application can
configure and query the configuration for each and any (or all) signalling
links.  This interface is used by the the
.BR slconfd (8)
configuration utility to query and configure signalling links in accordance
with the signalling link management model presented in Q.751-1.
.[
q751-1
.]
.PP
Two forms of configuration are possible: public and private configuration:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
In the public form, streams are opened by the configuration utility, normally
as part of a system startup procedure, and linked under the
.B sl-mux
driver using the
.IR I_PLINK (7)
input-output control operation.  Signalling link streams linked in this
fashion are available for attachment by any opened upper stream.
Also, these signalling links exhibit persistence as described below.
.IP 2.
In the private form, an upper stream is opened by an application and a
signalling link is configured and linked under the stream using the
.IR I_LINK (7)
input-output control operation.  The upper stream is attached to this lower
stream and the signalling link is not available for attachment by other upper
streams.  When the control stream is closed, the lower signalling link stream
is also closed as part of the dismantling of the multiplex.  Streams linked in
this fashion are private to the configuring application for use, but are
available for the collection of statistics, reporting of events, and
signalling link monitoring.
.\"
.SS Persistence
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
provides the ability for a Signalling Link to exist and operate without an
application present.  When configured, Signalling Links may be persistently
linked beneath the
.B sl-mux
driver using the
.IR I_PLINK (7)
input-output control operation.  Signalling Link linked in this fashion can be
attached by Streams opened on the upper multiplex and brought into service.
The
.B sl-mux
driver tracks the state of the Signalling Link and, if the upper Stream is
closed while the link is operating, the
.B sl-mux
driver places the link into local processor outage.  When a stream is again
opened, attached and enabled, local processor recovery is indicated and the
Signalling Link and be resumed without realignment.  This is a useful feature
for reconfiguring (or replacing) MTP on a live system, for example, to perform
live upgrades.
.\"
.SS Statistics
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver provides the ability to collect statistics (operational measurements)
for each and any signalling link.  This is accomplished by opening a
specialized minor device number on the driver,
.IR /dev/sl-stats .
Using modified
.BR sl_ioctl (4)
signalling link input-output controls, the administrative application can
collect statistics for each and any (or all) signalling links.  This interface
is used by the
.BR slstats (8)
utility to collect and record operational measurements for signalling links in
accordance with Q.751-1.
.[
q.751-1
.]
.\"
.SS Events
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver provides the ability to collect event notifications (operational
measurements) for each and any signalling link.  This is accomplished by
opening a specialized minor device number on the driver,
.IR /dev/sl-events .
Using modified
.BR sl_ioctl (4)
signalling link input-output controls, the administrative application can
collect event notifications for each and any (or all) signalling links.  This
interface is used by the
.BR slstats (8)
utility to collect and record operational measurements for signalling links in
accordance with Q.751-1.
.[
q751-1
.]
.\"
.SS Monitoring
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver provides the ability to monitor the service interface to each or any
signalling link.  This is accomplished by opening a specialized minor device
number on the driver,
.IR /dev/sl-mon ,
and attaching it using the
.BR SLM_IOCSMON " and " SLM_IOCCMON
input-output controls to specify the Signalling Links by lower multiplex
index, gloabl PPA or CLEI that the monitoring Stream wishes to monitor.
The stream may also monitor all lower stream by using a zero lower multipelx
index, zero global PPA and null CLEI.  Once activated for monitoring, lower
streams will deliver a copy of each and every STREAMS message that is passed
between an upper SL-user and the monitored signalling link(s), regardless
of whether the primiitve is an SL-user to SL-provider primitive or an
SL-provider to SL-user primitive.  The STREAMS message will be encapsulated
as follows:
.PP
The control part of the message will be copied and encapsulated in a band zero
(0)
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block with a
.B slmux_mon
structure prepended as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct slmux_mon {
    struct slmux_ppa mon_ppa;
    int mon_dir;
    uchar mon_msg_type;
    uchar mon_msg_band;
    ushort mon_msg_flags;
    uchar mon_msg_data[0];
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
The
.B slmux_mon
structure is defined in the
.RB < ss7/sl_mux.h >
header file and contains the following fields:
.TP
.I mon_ppa
This member contains a
.B slmux_ppa
structure that describes the multiplexer identifier, global PPA and CLEI for
the stream upon which the message was captured.
.TP
.I mon_dir
This member indicates the direction in which the message was flowing: (0),
upstream, (1) downstream.
.TP
.I mon_msg_type
This member contains the original message type that was contained in the
.I db_type
field of the
.BR datab (9)
structure associated with the control part of the message.
.TP
.I mon_msg_band
This member contains the original message band that was contained in the
.I b_band
field of the
.BR msgb (9)
structure associated with the control part of the message.
.TP
.I mon_msg_flags
This member contains the original message flags that were contained in the
.I b_flag
field of the
.BR msgb (9)
structure associated with the control part of the message.
.TP
.I mon_msg_data
This member defines the start of the encapsulated data from the original
control part message.
.PP
The
.B slmux_mon
structure is followed with the contents of the original control part message
block.  The data part of the message will be copied unchanged into
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks linked to the encapsulating
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block.
.PP
This provides the ability to monitor live signalling links that are in use by
other modules or drivers, such as the
.BR mtp (4),
Message Transfer Part driver, independent of the use of those drivers.
.\".PP
.\"A monitoring stream will also process signalling link input-output controls on
.\"the monitoring stream.  See
.\".BR sl_ioctl (4)
.\"for a discussion of the available signalling link input-output controls.
.PP
Monitoring of signalling links is performed using the
.BR slmon (8)
utility.  The utility opens a
.I /dev/sl-mon
stream, and associates it with a specific signalling link using the
.BR SLM_IOCSMON
input-output control.  Once set for monitoring, primitives that traverse the
SL-user to SL-provider interface are delivered to the stream.  The monitor
disassociates with the signalling link using the
.BR SLM_IOCCMON
input-output control, or by simply closing the stream.  The stream will also
respond to SL input-output controls,
.BR sli_ioctl (4),
from the monitoring stream.  The monitoring process must have root privilege
to open the
.I /dev/sl-mon
device.
.PP
Note that a modified
.BR libpcap (3)
library might also be provided in the future that will allow live capture of
raw SS7 (MTP3 header) packets for use with
.BR ethereal (1)
or
.BR wireshark (1).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
It is not necessary to use the

.TP
.I slm_ppa
This member specifies the global PPA for the stream.  This global PPA must be
unique across all lower multiplex Signalling Link streams and is used by upper
multiplex user and management streams to attach to or otherwise identify the
Stream.  If a CLEI is provided, this member is optional.  When not specified,
this member is populated with the value zero (0).
.TP
.I slm_clei
This member specifies the Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) for the
stream.  The CLEI is an ASCII string of up to 32 characters (null terminated
if less than 32 characters).  This CLEI must be unique across all lower
multiplex Signalling Link streams and is used by upper multiplex user and

.SH DEVICES
.PP
.TP
.I /dev/sl
Device opened by SL-user.  Streams can be attached to lower multiplex streams
using the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive, or linked using the
.IR I_LINK (7)
input-output control and configured using the
.B SLM_IOCSPPA
input-output control.
.TP
.I /dev/sl-admin
Device opened by the
.BR slconfd (8)
utility for configuration management of Signalling Links.
.I /dev/sl-admin
Streams can be attached to lower multiplex streams for which the caller has
permission using the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive.  Normal signalling link input-output control commands can then be
performed on the signalling link.
.TP
.I /dev/sl-stats
Device opened by the
.BR slstats (8)
utility for operational measurements statistics collection for Signalling
Links.
Streams can be attached to lower multiplex streams for which the caller has
permission using the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive.  Statistics collection information will then be encapsulated and
delivered to this stream instead of the SL-user stream.  Statistics collection
on a single stream or multiple streams is possible.
.TP
.I /dev/sl-events
Device opened by the
.BR slstats (8)
utility for operational measurement event collection for Signalling Links.
Streams can be attached to lower multiplex streams for which the caller has
permission using the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive.  Event reporting information will then be encapsulated and
delivered to this stream instead of the SL-user stream.
.TP
.I /dev/sl-mon
Device opened by the
.BR slmon (8)
monitoring utility for monitoring of Signalling Links.
Streams can be attached to lower multiplex streams for which the caller has
permission using the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive.  Copies of primitives exchanged between SL-User and SL-Provider
will then be encapsulated and delivered to this stream.
