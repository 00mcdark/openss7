.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B SM_MOD
is a simplistic implementation of the Signalling System no. 7 (SS7) Message
Transfer Part (MTP) as specified in
.I ITU-T Recommendation Q.704
.[
q704
.]
and
.IR "ANSI T1.111.4" .
.[
t1.111
.]
.B SM_MOD
provides reliable sequenced or unsequenced delivery of packages over a
connectionless transport between two
.B MTP
endpoints.
.B SM_MOD
provides strong assurances that the data arrives in order on a Stream, if
requested, and maintains sequencing of packages in the face of most network
failures.  It generates and checks a per-packet checksum to catch transmission
errors.
.B MTP
routing routes around link and node failures in the
.BR SS7 (4)
network.
.PP
.B SM_MOD
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
pushable module.
The module is pushed over a
.BR sl (4)
Stream providing the
.BR sli (7)
interface using the
.I I_PUSH
command of
.BR streamio (7).
Once pushed, the module must be configured using
.BR mtp_ioctl (4),
and provides a Stream providing the
.B MTP
protocol service interface using the M-primitives of the Message Transfer Part
Interface described in
.BR mtpi (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
A Stream with the
.B SM_MOD
module pushed supports a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2s)
system calls on the
.IR sl_stream .
These management controls are documented in
.BR mtp_ioctl (4).

.SH VERSIONS
.PP
The MTP interface is specific to the
.B OpenSS7
SS7 stack.
.B SM_MOD
supports Version 2 of the interface.
