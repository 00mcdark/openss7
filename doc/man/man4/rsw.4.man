.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B RSW
is an implementation of a Real-Time Protocol
.RB ( RTP )
Real-Time Control Protocol
.RB ( RTCP )
defined in  RFC 1889.
.[
rfc1889
.]
.B RSW
provides switching and control of media and control in
.BR udp (4)
packets.
.PP
The primary purpose of the
.B RSW
driver is provide multiplexing, cross-connection and trasncoding of RTP media
and control Streams.  The bottom half of the driver is connected into the
Linux IP packet nexus and intercepts UDP packets with specific source and
destination transport addresses associated with an RTP media connection.
Associated with each RTP media connection is a Stream opened on the driver to
which RTP packets are to be delivered.  In this way, packets are
demultiplexed from the Linux IP nexus to the requesting Stream.  Associated
with each data packet is a connection identifier that identifies the RTP
media and control connection to which each data packet belongs.
.PP
.B RSW
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
driver that is opened directly.
The
.B RTP
module provides a Multiplex Interface (MXI),
.BR mxi (7),
to the Stream head.
