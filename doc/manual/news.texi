@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This is the fourth public release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE}.  The
sub-packages have been reorganized for this release.  See @file{README} in the
release for a sub-package listing.  Aside from sub-package reorganization, the
major difference from previous release is that this release no longer contains
@cite{LiS}.  Too many of the sub-packages will not even build against
@cite{LiS} because of its Stream head deficiencies.

Most of the sub-packages in the release are production grade for @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}.  All existing validation test suites run clean on supported
distributions and architectures.  The packages build better Debian/Ubuntu .deb
files.

It is unlikely that the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} will be released as
frequently as before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To rebuild
the master package with a new sub-package release, simply replace the
directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package
release and then rebuild the master package.

Following are the major changes since the last release candidate:

@itemize -
@item
Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode
diet patchset).

@item Added @file{strnsl-@value{VERSION_STRNSL}} package.
@end itemize

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D.rc3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D.rc3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D.rc3

Third release candidate.

@itemize -
@item
The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the 'doxy' make
target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the distribution for more
information.

@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.  The @samp{make installcheck} target will now automatically
test both 64-bit native and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other,
on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Added complete documentation and @cite{Installation and Reference Manual} for
the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} (this manual).

@item
Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .95
@item @tab -- @file{strbcm-@value{VERSION_STRBCM}}
@item @tab -- @file{striso-@value{VERSION_STRISO}}
@item @tab -- @file{strsock-@value{VERSION_STRSOCK}}
@item @tab -- @file{strtty-@value{VERSION_STRTTY}}
@item @tab -- @file{strutil-@value{VERSION_STRUTIL}}
@end multitable

@item
Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
documentation present in the release directory.

@item
Dropped support for @cite{LiS}.

@item
Sub-packages will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6 kernels
under @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} only.

@item
This release candidate provides support for additional SuSE distributions on
ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2,
SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

@item
This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp drivers at the
2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British Columbia.  This version was
interoperability tested with all implementations present.
@end itemize

This was an subscriber release.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D.rc2
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D.rc2
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D.rc2

Second release candidate.

This release candidate also contains the results of performance testing of the
new second generation UDP driver (implemented completely in STREAMS instead of
using an internal socket).

This release candidate also contains support for SuSE 10.1.

This was an subscriber release.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.Drc1
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.Drc1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.Drc1

First release candidate.

@itemize -
@item Release candidate for Mark Fugate.
@item Added --enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.
@item Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.
@end itemize

This was an subscriber release.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.C
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.C
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.C

Distribution check for entire master package.  Trying to get master package
into form where it can be released as a complete package.

This was a public release.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.B
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.B
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.B

Minor changes for wider release, better master packaging and bug fixes.

This was a public release.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.A
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.A
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.A

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream version
only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All RPM release
numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian release numbers will be
@samp{_0}.  If you wish to apply patches and release the package, please bump up
the release number and apply a suitable release suffix for your organization.
We leave Debian release number _1 reserved for your use, so you can still bundle
the source in the .dsc file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels and
popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider distribution
support.

This was a public release.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1

Initial autoconf/RPM release of the OpenSS7 master package.

This master package contains all other OpenSS7 releases.
