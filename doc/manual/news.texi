@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This is the fourth public release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE}.  See
@file{README} in the release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the
sub-packages in the release are production grade for @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.
All existing validation test suites run clean on supported distributions and
architectures.

It is unlikely that the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} will be released as
frequently as before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To rebuild the
master package with a new sub-package release, simply replace the directory to
which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package release and then
rebuild the master package.  This release provides support for recent
distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

@itemize -
@item
Addition of the @command{osr61} sub-package that contains
Dialogic@registeredsymbol{} Open System Release 6.1 version 239 GPL drivers.

@item
A few minor corrections to the common build process.

@item
Support for autoconf 2.61 and gettext 0.16.

@item
Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kernels.

@item
The package now looks for subpackages with a version number as unpacked by
separate tarball.

@end itemize

@emph{This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before
reporting bugs.}

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and
builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the @cite{GNU General Public License
Version 2}.  The release is available as an @command{autoconf} tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html,downloads page} for the
@command{autoconf} tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and
binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/@value{PACKAGE}_pkg.html,@value{PACKAGE} package
page}.

See
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/ChangeLog}
and @uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/NEWS}
in the release for more information.  Also, see the @file{@value{PACKAGE}.pdf}
manual in the release (also in html
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/@value{PACKAGE}_manual.html}).

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D

This is the fourth public release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE}.  The
sub-packages have been reorganized for this release.  See @file{README} in the
release for a sub-package listing.  Aside from sub-package reorganization, the
major difference from previous release is that this release no longer contains
@cite{LiS}.  Too many of the sub-packages will not even build against
@cite{LiS} because of its Stream head deficiencies.

Most of the sub-packages in the release are production grade for @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}.  All existing validation test suites run clean on supported
distributions and architectures.  The packages build better Debian/Ubuntu .deb
files.

It is unlikely that the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} will be released as
frequently as before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To rebuild
the master package with a new sub-package release, simply replace the
directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package
release and then rebuild the master package.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

@itemize -
@item
Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .95
@item @tab -- @file{strnsl-@value{VERSION_STRNSL}}
@item @tab -- @file{strbcm-@value{VERSION_STRBCM}}
@item @tab -- @file{striso-@value{VERSION_STRISO}}
@item @tab -- @file{strsock-@value{VERSION_STRSOCK}}
@item @tab -- @file{strtty-@value{VERSION_STRTTY}}
@item @tab -- @file{strutil-@value{VERSION_STRUTIL}}
@end multitable

@item
Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
documentation present in the release directory.

@item
This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp drivers at the
2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British Columbia.  This version was
interoperability tested with all implementations present.

@item
Better support for Ubuntu and recent @command{gcc} compilers, including debian
script corrections.

@item
Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode
diet patchset).

@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.  The @samp{make installcheck} target will now automatically
test both 64-bit native and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other,
on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Added versions to all library symbols.

@item
Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.

@item
Dropped support for @cite{LiS}.

@item 
Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device
number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.
Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6 kernels under
Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  @file{streams} now supports expanded addressable
minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major
device number on 2.6 kernels:  LiS cannot support this change.

@item
Better detection of SuSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as
x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3,
SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

@item
Improvide compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent @command{gcc}
compilers and some idiosyncratic beahviour for some distributions (primarily
SuSE).

@item
Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in
addition to kernel programs.  Added new @samp{--with-optimize} option to
@command{configure} to accomplish this.

@item
Added @samp{--disable-devel} @command{configure} option to suppress building
and installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure
runtime targets that do not need the development environment (static
libraries, manual pages, documentation).

@item
Added @command{send-pr} script for automatic problem report generation.

@item
Each package will not build @manpage{doxygen(1)} html documentation with the
@samp{make doxy} target.  See @samp{make help} or @file{README-make} in the
distribution for more information.

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream version
only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All RPM release
numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian release numbers will be
@samp{_0}.  If you wish to apply patches and release the package, please bump up
the release number and apply a suitable release suffix for your organization.
We leave Debian release number _1 reserved for your use, so you can still bundle
the source in the .dsc file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels and
popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider distribution
support.

This was a public release.
