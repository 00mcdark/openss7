@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This is the seventh @cite{OpenSS7 Project} release of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package.  For
a sub-package listing, see
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}/README,@file{README}} in the release.  Most
of the sub-packages in the release are production grade for @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}.@footnote{Sub-packages are no longer supported on the deprecated @cite{LiS} STREAMS
package.}  All existing validation test suites run clean on supported distributions, production
kernels and architectures.

The original intention was that the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package not be released as often as
subpackages and, indeed, newer subpackages can be strapped into the master package and built
automatically.  However, in reality, the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package has been released as
often as the subpackages.  To rebuild the master package with a new sub-package release, simply
replace the directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpackged sub-package reelase and
then rebuild the master package.  This release provides support for recent distributions, production
kernels and tool chains.  The release also provides support for significiant new features in the
sub-packages.

Major features since the last public release are:

@itemize -
@item
Deprecated sub-packages have been excluded from the master package release.  The excluded
sub-packages are:

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .95
@item @tab -- @file{sctp-@value{VERSION_SCTP}}
@item @tab -- @file{iperf-@value{VERSION_IPERF}}
@item @tab -- @file{netperf-@value{VERSION_NETPERF}}
@item @tab -- @file{osr61-@value{VERSION_OSR}}
@end multitable

@item
Documentation license upgraded to GFDL 1.3.

@item
Updated tool chain to @file{m4-1.4.13}, @file{automake-1.10.2}, @file{bison-2.4.1},
@file{libtool-2.2.6a}, @file{texinfo-4.13a}.

@item
Addition of the following sub-packages:

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .95
@item @tab -- @file{stratm-@value{VERSION_STRATM}}
@end multitable

@item
Addition of the @file{stratm} sub-package to the master build and release that now includes all of
the ATM components that were previously part of the @file{strss7} sub-package.

@item
Significant feature updates were made to:

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .95
@item @tab -- @file{strchan-@value{VERSION_STRCHAN}}
@item @tab -- @file{strsock-@value{VERSION_STRSOCK}}
@item @tab -- @file{strnsl-@value{VERSION_STRNSL}}
@item @tab -- @file{sigtran-@value{VERSION_SIGTRAN}}
@end multitable

@item
Significant rework of the @file{strchan} sub-package into the @file{strss7}, @file{strisdn},
@file{strx25} and @file{striso} packages.  One single driver now meets the needs of all sub-packages.

@item
Completion of the @file{strsock} package, moves from pre-alpha to beta.

@item
The @file{strnsl} subpackage moves from alpha to production.

@item
Significant completion of the @file{sigtran} package: all components moved back to production.

@end itemize

@emph{This is a public, stable, production grade release of the package: it deprecates previous
releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before reporting bugs.}

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 @manref{rpm(8)} and @manref{dpkg(1)} based distributions, and
can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released strictly under the @cite{GNU Affero General Public License Version
3}; however, commercial licensing is available.  The release is available as an @manref{autoconf(1)}
tarball, SRPM, DSC, and a set of binary RPMs and DEBs for popular distributions.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss.org/@value{PACKAGE}_pkg.html,package page} for the @mantype{autoconf(1)}
tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/repos.html,repository page} for information concerning network
installation and update sources.

See @uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/ChangeLog} and
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/NEWS} in the release for more

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on
production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the @cite{GNU Affero General Public License Version 3}.  The

This is the fifth public release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE}.  See
@file{README} in the release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the
sub-packages in the release are production grade for @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.
All existing validation test suites run clean on supported distributions and

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.E
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.E
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.E

This is the fourth public release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE}.  See
@file{README} in the release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the
sub-packages in the release are production grade for @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.
All existing validation test suites run clean on supported distributions and
architectures.

It is unlikely that the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} will be released as
frequently as before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To rebuild the
master package with a new sub-package release, simply replace the directory to
which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package release and then
rebuild the master package.  This release provides support for recent
distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

@itemize -
@item
Addition of the @command{osr61} sub-package that contains
Dialogic@registeredsymbol{} Open System Release 6.1 version 239 GPL drivers.

@item
A few minor corrections to the common build process.

@item
Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.D

This is the fourth public release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE}.  The
sub-packages have been reorganized for this release.  See @file{README} in the
release for a sub-package listing.  Aside from sub-package reorganization, the
major difference from previous release is that this release no longer contains
@cite{LiS}.  Too many of the sub-packages will not even build against
@cite{LiS} because of its Stream head deficiencies.

Most of the sub-packages in the release are production grade for @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}.  All existing validation test suites run clean on supported
distributions and architectures.  The packages build better Debian/Ubuntu .deb
files.

It is unlikely that the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} will be released as
frequently as before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To rebuild
the master package with a new sub-package release, simply replace the
directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package
release and then rebuild the master package.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

@itemize -
@item
Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .95
@item @tab -- @file{strnsl-0.9.2.1}
@item @tab -- @file{strbcm-0.9.2.1}
@item @tab -- @file{striso-0.9.2.1}
@item @tab -- @file{strsock-0.9.2.1}
@item @tab -- @file{strtty-0.9.2.1}
@item @tab -- @file{strutil-0.9.2.1}
@end multitable

@item
Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
documentation present in the release directory.

@item
This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp drivers at the
2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British Columbia.  This version was
interoperability tested with all implementations present.

@item
Better support for Ubuntu and recent @command{gcc} compilers, including debian
script corrections.

@item
Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode
diet patchset).

@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.  The @samp{make installcheck} target will now automatically
test both 64-bit native and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other,
on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Added versions to all library symbols.

@item
Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.

@item
Dropped support for @cite{LiS}.

@item 
Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device
number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.
Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6 kernels under
Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  @file{streams} now supports expanded addressable
minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major
device number on 2.6 kernels:  LiS cannot support this change.

@item
Better detection of SuSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as
x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3,
SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

@item
Improvide compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent @command{gcc}
compilers and some idiosyncratic beahviour for some distributions (primarily
SuSE).

@item
Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in
addition to kernel programs.  Added new @samp{--with-optimize} option to
@command{configure} to accomplish this.

@item
Added @samp{--disable-devel} @command{configure} option to suppress building
and installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure
runtime targets that do not need the development environment (static
libraries, manual pages, documentation).

@item
Added @command{send-pr} script for automatic problem report generation.

@item
Each package will not build @manpage{doxygen(1)} html documentation with the
@samp{make doxy} target.  See @samp{make help} or @file{README-make} in the
distribution for more information.

only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All RPM release
numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian release numbers will be
@samp{_0}.  If you wish to apply patches and release the package, please bump up
the release number and apply a suitable release suffix for your organization.
We leave Debian release number _1 reserved for your use, so you can still bundle
the source in the .dsc file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels and
popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider distribution
support.
