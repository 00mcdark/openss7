A report was made by Chris from Sandia that the build process choked on building 32-bit libraries
and applications on an x86_64 system under Ubuntu Fiesty (7.04).  While most other distributions
include the @command{gcc} 32-bit compatibility libraries for 64-bit architectures with a 32-bit
emulation mode, Ubuntu (and maybe Debian too) does not.  The Ubuntu 7.04 package that is missing is
the @file{lib32gcc1} package.  There are two workarounds to this difficulty: add the
@file{lib32gcc1} package (with apt), or add the @samp{--disable-32bit-libs} flag to
@samp{configure}.
