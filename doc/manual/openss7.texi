@cindex background

@uref{http://www.openss7.org/, The OpenSS7 Project} was started in 1996 and made its Web debut in
2000.  The initial objectives of the OpenSS7 Project were to provide an SS7 stack implementation for
Linux.  Initial work on development of the SS7 stack attempted to integrate the SS7 protocol
elements into Linux's BSD-like Sockets based networking system.  Early on this approach became
problematic.  Although the true BSD sockets networking system is somewhat amenable to a wider range
of protocols that just the TCP/IP protocol suite, as evidenced by the early adoption of OSI
protocols into BSD 4.3, the incarnation of the system present in Linux deviates largely from the
BSD module in that there is no clean separation between the socket layer and the protocol layer, and
that the protocol layer cannot actually be stacked in the same fashion as is possible in BSD.  Also,
the Linux @type{sk_buff} was crude and did not have the capabilities of the BSD @type{mbuf}.  These
and other difficulties led the project, in 2001, to pursue the STREAMS approach to networking.

In 2003, the OpenSS7 Project decided to begin a completely new
implementation of STREAMS for Linux based, on SVR 4.2 documentation, called @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}, or @cite{LfS}.  The development of @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} culminated with the first
production grade release for Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernel services at the beginning of 2006.

Beginning in 2001, the OpenSS7 Project has developed STREAMS components over a wide range of
applications, not just SS7.  These components are divided into groups of components that were
released within separate sub-packages of an OpenSS7 Master Package.  While the separation of
sub-packages suited the needs of maintaining modules and drivers across multiple STREAMS packages,
it led to a significan maintenance load.  In early 2009, the OpenSS7 Project collapsed these
sub-packages into a single OpenSS7 package significantly reducing the maintenance load and providing
an more straightforward distribution suitable for repository downloads.

@cindex package contents

The @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is intended as a single build and installation package for
all components available from @uref{http://www.openss7.org/, The OpenSS7 Project}.  The
package began as a slim framework for development of the other packages and blossomed into a
combined build and development environment for all OpenSS7 packages.  The package is
currently very mature and provides a simple way for users of the OpenSS7 components to download, build
and install all available OpenSS7 Project components without concern or consideration for intricate
dependencies between components.

Because sub-packages forks such as @file{iperf} and @file{netperf} have outlived their usefulness, a
new package was generated that collapsed all of the former subpackages, including STREAMS, into a
single release package containing all OpenSS7 components.

Whereas in the old master package, protocol components and suites were organized by subpackage,
components in the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package are now organized by protocol suite and application.

The disposition of the old subpackages is as follows:

@table @file

@item strutil-@value{VERSION_STRUTIL}
The @file{strutil} package was a package that provided utilities that were
missing in other implementations, but which were incoporporated into @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}.  All components are represented in the
@file{openss7-@value{VERSION}} release.

@node Development Header Files::
@section Header Files

Header files are installed, typically, in the @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}/} subdirectory.
To use the header files from the package, @samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} must be included
in the @command{gcc} command line as a preprocessor option.

@ignore
In general, @samp{-I} include preprocessor directives on the @command{gcc} command line should
be ordered in the reverse order of the dependencies between packages.  So, for example, if the
include files from all add-on packages are required, the order of these directives would be:
@samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strxns}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strcompat}
@samp{-I/usr/include/streams}.
@end ignore

Following are the user visible header files provided by the
@file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package in the directory
@file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}:

@subsection User Space Programs

Typical include files for interacting with Transport providers from user space include the

@node Kernel Module Development
@section Kernel Modules

@menu
* Using Kbuild::
@end menu

Developing Linux Fast-STREAMS kernel modules is similar to user space programs with regard to header
files.  @file{/usr/include/openss7} should be placed as an include directory to search on the
@command{gcc} command line.  The rules for compiling @cite{Linux} kernel modules and the rules for
compiling @acronym{STREAMS} modules and drivers should be followed.  In particular, several
important intricacies should be considered:

@itemize @bullet

@item The @command{gcc} compiler used to compile the kernel modules must be the same version of
compiler that was used to compile the kernel and @acronym{STREAMS} base package.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must have the same compile flags that were used to compile the
kernel and @acronym{STREAMS} base package.  @command{kbuild} can be used to accomplish this.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must define several important kernel defines including
@samp{-DLINUX}, @samp{-D__KERNEL__}, as well as the base name of the module.  Again, @command{kbuild}
can be used to accomplish this.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must include several important files directly on the command
line, such as, @samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-autoconf.h} and
@samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-modversions.h}.@footnote{The
kernel version, @samp{@value{_kversion}}, is just an example.  For the running kernel, use the
output of @samp{uname -r}.}

@cindex conformance

Although @cite{OpenSS7 Project} software is of high quality, and untested behaviour is often correct
behaviour, the principle of the @cite{OpenSS7 Project} is to test all functional requirements
against the behaviour of the package in a repeatable validation test suite that can be used to
perform regression, target architecture validation and trouble shooting, (@pxrefman{Maturity}, and
@pxrefman{Test Suites}).
