@uref{http://www.openss7.org/, The OpenSS7 Project} was started in 1996 and made its Web debut in
2000.  The initial objectives of the OpenSS7 Project were to provide an SS7 stack implementation for
Linux.  Initial work on development of the SS7 stack attempted to integrate the SS7 protocol
elements into Linux's BSD-like Sockets based networking system.  Early on this approach became
problematic.  Although the true BSD sockets networking system is somewhat amenable to a wider range
of protocols that just the TCP/IP protocol suite, as evidenced by the early adoption of OSI
protocols into BSD 4.3, the incarnation of the system present in Linux deviates largely from the
BSD module in that there is no clean separation between the socket layer and the protocol layer, and
that the protocol layer cannot actually be stacked in the same fashion as is possible in BSD.  Also,
the Linux @type{sk_buff} was crude and did not have the capabilities of the BSD @type{mbuf}.  These
and other difficulties led the project, in 2001, to pursue the STREAMS approach to networking.

At the time (in 2000), there was an implementation for STREAMS for Linux, called Linux STREAMS, or
@cite{LiS} for short.  The OpenSS7 Project worked extensively with enhancing the @cite{LiS} package
for use with SS7 and SIGTRAN protocols.  The versions of @cite{LiS} that were available for the
Linux 2.2 series kernels available at the time were quite stable.@footnote{Linux 2.2 series kernels
did @emph{not} support symmetrical multi-processing (SMP) making it similar to SVR 4.0.}  The
versions of @cite{LiS} that were available for the Linux 2.4 series kernels attempted to support SMP
using the same SVR 4.0-like STREAMS model.  These versions of @cite{LiS} were incredibly difficult
to stabilize on Linux 2.4 series kernels.  Much of the problems with @cite{LiS} appeared to be
related to a poor coding style, and the attempt to maintain portability to systems other than Linux
(even though it appears that ports were not even popular) resulting in obfuscation of the code.

Therefore, in 2003, the OpenSS7 Project decided to replace @cite{LiS} with a completely new
implementation of STREAMS for Linux based, on SVR 4.2 documentation, called @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}, or @cite{LfS}.  The OpenSS7 Project also decided to support a fork of @cite{LiS} in
the meantime to developing @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} to production grade.  The project maintained a
fork of @cite{LiS-2.16} for the Linux 2.4 kernel series, and later a fork of @cite{LiS-2.18} for the
Linux 2.6 kernel series.  The development of @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} culminated with the first
production grade release for Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernel services at the beginning of 2006, after which
the OpenSS7 forks of @cite{LiS} were completely deprecated.

Beginning in 2001, the OpenSS7 Project has developed STREAMS components over a wide range of
applications, not just SS7.  These components are divided into groups of components that were
released within separate sub-packages of an OpenSS7 Master Package.  While the separation of
sub-packages suited the needs of maintaining modules and drivers across multiple STREAMS packages,
it led to a significan maintenance load.  In early 2009, the OpenSS7 Project collapsed these
sub-packages into a single OpenSS7 package significantly reducing the maintenance load and providing
an more straightforward distribution suitable for repository downloads.

@node Package Contents
@section Package Contents
@cindex package contents

The @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is intended as a single build and installation package for
all components available from @uref{http://www.openss7.org/, The OpenSS7 Project}.  The
package began as a slim framework for development of the other packages and blossomed into a
combined build and development environment for all OpenSS7 packages.  The package is
currently very mature and provides a simple way for users of the OpenSS7 components to download, build
and install all available OpenSS7 Project components without concern or consideration for intricate
dependencies between components.

Because OpenSS7 components first built with @dfn{Linux STREAMS (LiS)} but now builds with the superior
@dfn{Linux Fast-STREAMS (LfS)}, the master package had the objective from the onset of being able to
build all OpenSS7 packages against either @dfn{LiS} or @dfn{LfS} or both.  This was the case from
@dfn{LiS} version @emph{2.18.1} through @emph{2.18.3} and @dfn{streams} version @emph{0.7a.3}
through @emph{0.7a.5}, or master package releases @emph{0.9.2.A} through @emph{0.9.2.C}.  With the
release of master package @emph{0.9.2.D} containing @dfn{streams} @emph{0.9.2.1}, @dfn{LiS} was no
longer supported in the master package.  @dfn{LiS} @emph{2.18.3} was the final public release of
@dfn{LiS} from the OpenSS7 Project.@footnote{Additional internal releases up to @emph{2.18.7} are
available on the CVS archive.}

Because @dfn{LiS} is now completely deprecated, and sub-packages forks such as @file{iperf} and
@file{netperf} have outlived their usefulness, a new package was generated that collapsed all of the
former subpackages, including STREAMS, into a single release package containing all OpenSS7
components.

Whereas in the old master package, protocol components and suites were organized by subpackage,
components in the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package are now organized by protocol suite and application.

@chapter Development
@cindex developing

@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} provides all of the header files, shared object and static libraries,
manual pages and documentation necessary for the development of both user space applications
programs and kernel space @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers based on the package.  The sections that
follow describe these development facilities.

@menu
* Development Header Files::
* Static and Shared Libraries::
* Kernel Module Development::
* Manual Pages::
@end menu

@node Development Header Files::
@section Header Files

Header files are installed, typically, in the @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}/} subdirectory.  To
use the header files from the package, @samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} must be included in the
@command{gcc} command line as a preprocessor option.

In general, @samp{-I} include preprocessor directives on the @command{gcc} command line should be
ordered in the reverse order of the dependencies between packages.  So, for example, if the include
files from all add-on packages are required, the order of these directives would be:
@samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strxns}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strcompat}
@samp{-I/usr/include/streams}.

Following are the user visible header files provided by the @file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}}
package in the directory @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}:

@table @file


@end table

@subsection User Space Programs

Typical include files for interacting with Transport providers from user space include the
@file{xti.h} header file.  Additional header files for interacting with specific drivers or modules
may also be required.  The @cite{xti.h} header file is for interacting with the XTI library.

@subsection Kernel Space Drivers and Modules

Typical include files for writing @dfn{STREAMS} module and drivers implementing transport providers
in kernels space include @cite{xti.h} and @cite{xti_sctp.h}.  The header files provide access to
definitions for the TPI interface and additional XTI definitions for use by @dfn{STREAMS} drivers
and modules.  Additional header files for interacting with specific drivers or modules may also be
required.

Aside from including this header files, the general procedures for compiling @dfn{STREAMS} modules
and drivers also apply to @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers written to the Transport Provider
Interface.

@node Static and Shared Libraries
@section Libraries

Shared or static version of the @cite{libxnet} library may be linked when using the
@file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package.@footnote{Note that the @file{libxnet} library is
now provided by the @file{strxnet-@value{VERSION_STRXNET}} package.} The library may either be
specified on the @command{gcc} command line as a shared library (e.g. @samp{-lxnet}) or as a static
library (e.g.  @samp{/usr/lib/libxnet.a}).

If the shared object library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command
line:

@table @samp

@item -lxnet
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libxnet.so} shared library.

@end table

If the static library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command line:

@table @samp

@item /usr/lib/libxnet.a
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libxnet.a} static library.

@end table

@node Kernel Module Development
@section Kernel Modules

Developing TPI kernel modules is similar to user space programs with regard to header files.
@file{/usr/include/strxnet} should be placed as an include directory to search on the @command{gcc}
command line.  The rules for compiling @cite{Linux} kernel modules and the rules for compiling
@dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers should be followed.  In particular, several important intricacies
should be considered:

@itemize @bullet

@item The @command{gcc} compiler used to compile the kernel modules must be the same version of
compiler that was used to compile the kernel and @dfn{STREAMS} base package.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must have the same compile flags that were used to compile the
kernel and @dfn{STREAMS} base package.  @command{kbuild} can be used to accomplish this.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must define several important kernel defines including
@samp{-DLINUX}, @samp{-D__KERNEL__}, as well as the base name of the module.  Again, @command{kbuild}
can be used to accomplish this.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must include several important files directly on the command
line, such as, @samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-autoconf.h} and
@samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-modversions.h}.@footnote{The
kernel version, @samp{@value{_kversion}}, is just an example.  For the running kernel, use the
output of @samp{uname -r}.}

Although @cite{OpenSS7 Project} software is of high quality, and untested behaviour is often correct
behaviour, the principle of the @cite{OpenSS7 Project} is to test all functional requirements
against the behaviour of the package in a repeatable validation test suite that can be used to
perform regression, target architecture validation and trouble shooting, (@pxrefman{Maturity}, and
@pxrefman{Test Suites}).
