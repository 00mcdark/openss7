.uh "Abstract"
.lp
This Internet Draft provides information for the Internet community on test
cases for testing the SS7 M2P2-User Peer-to-Peer Adaptation Layer
.[
m2pa06
.]
based on the conformance test specifications for SS7 MTP Level 2.
.[
q781
.]
.sh 1 "Introduction"
.lp
This draft provides a set of detailed test of the SS7 MTP2-User Peer-to-Peer
Adaptation Layer
.[
m2pa06
.]
based on the test specifications for SS7 MTP Level 2.
.[
q781
.]
These tests are intended to validate the SS7 MTP2-User Peer-to-Peer Adaptation
Layer (M2PA) protocol.
.[
m2pa06
.]
.lp
These tests attempt to completely validate the M2PA protocol without
redundancy.  Each test is described as simply as possible to check precisely
the elementary function of the protocol.  The tests are listed in no specific
order\*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
An implementation of M2PA which conforms to these test specifications and a
test program which executes these tests are available from
http://www.openss7.org/downloads.html/.
.)d
.sh 2 "Change History"
.sh 3 "Changes from draft-bidulock-sigtran-m2pa-test-01"
.np
The test specification has been updated to M2PA Draft Revision 6,
.[
m2pa06
.]
with anticipated changes for M2PA Draft Revision 7.
.[
m2pa07
.]
.np
M2PA Draft Revision 6
.[
m2pa06
.]
provides for acknowledgement of DATA messages using a special DATA message
which contains no data payload.  This message has been labelled "DATA-ACK" in
the diagrams.

This has resulted in changes to test cases 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 3.4,
3.6, 3.8, 4.1, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.9, 8.10, 8.11, 10.2
.np
Although M2PA Draft Revision 6
.[
m2pa06
.]
specifies that the DATA-ACK message should have its Forward Sequence Number
(FSN) incremented as with any other normal DATA message, this causes problems
in that the DATA-ACK must them be acknowledged.  This test specification
anticipates M2PA Draft Revision 7 by not incrementing FSN for DATA-ACK messages.
.np
M2PA Draft Revision 6
.[
m2pa06
.]
provides FSN and BSN sequence numbers in STATUS messages as well as DATA
messages.  It has been proposed that STATUS messages not contain FSN and BSN
because they should essentially be ignored because of mis-ordering
possibilities.  Therefore, FSN and BSN of STATUS messages are ignored in this
version of the test specification in anticipation of M2PA Draft Revision 7.
.sh 3 "Changes from draft-bidulock-sigtran-m2pa-test-00"
.np
The test specification has been updated to M2PA Draft Revision 4,
.[
m2pa04
.]
with anticipated changes for M2PA Draft Revision 5.
.[
m2pa05
.]
.np
M2PA Draft Revision 4
.[
m2pa04
.]
no longer contains a special proving message.  Status PROVING-NORMAL or
PROVING-EMERGENCY messages are padded and sent repeatedly to accomplish
proving during the proving period.  The occurence of PROVING messages has been
removed from the test cases to update this draft to match the M2PA draft revision 4.
.[
m2pa04
.]
.np
M2PA Draft Revision 4
.[
m2pa04
.]
contains both forward and backward sequence numbers (FSN, BSN).  The test
cases were updated to include the sequence numbers (where other than zero) and
test cases were added for abnormal backwards sequence numbers.
.np
M2PA Draft Revision 4
.[
m2pa04
.]
has no formal method for acknowledging the receipt of a DATA message when
there are no other messages to send (DATA or STATUS).  The Status of
"In Service", for which no other use has been specified in the current draft,
.[
m2pa04
.]
is used as such an explicit acknowledgement.  Another possibilty would have
been to send a DATA message with no data in it.
The old "ACK" message is now labelled "IN-SERVICE".
.np
The status message previously labelled "IN-SERVICE" has been relabelled
"READY" to better reflect the name of that atatus message in the draft and to
not conflict with the new
.[
m2pa04
.]
"IN-SERVICE" status message.
.sh 1 "Test Environment"
.sh 2 "Test Configurations"

.lp
A single M2PA link is used in the tests.  \fI\*(&f\n(&n\fR and
\fI\*(&f\n(|n\fR show a single link between IUT and PT.  In \fITest
Configuration 1\fR as shown in \fI\*(&f\n(&n\fR, PT initiates the association.
In \fITest Configuration 2\fR as shown in \fI\*(&f\n(|n\fR, IUT initiates the
association.  Test specifications in both configurations are written to test
the M2PA at IUT .

.sh 3 "Timer Values"

It is recommended that the following timer values be configured at the IUT for
the purposes of performing these validation tests:

.ip "T1"
45 seconds
.ip "T2"
5 seconds
.ip "T2l"
20 seconds

.ip "T7"
1 second
.ip "T8"
0.1 seconds

.)l
.sh 3 "Buffer Threshold Values"
.lp
It is recommended that the following buffer threshold values be configured at
the IUT for the purpose of performing these validation tests:
.(l I F
.ip "N1"
(not applicable)
.ip "N2"
127 messages
.)l
.sh 3 "MSU Length"
.lp
It is illustrated that all DATA messages which are sent have a payload length
of 35 bytes.  This, however, is not essential to the correct performance of
the tests and is an arbitrary choice.  Use of different valid MSU lengths
should not have an affect of the results.
.sh 1 "Tests"
.sh 2 "Link State Control - Expected signal units/orders"
.sh 3 "Initialization (Power-up)"
.lp
These tests check that the IUT enters the correct state upon establishment of
the SCTP association.  Establishing the association at both peers is the
equivalent to the Q.703 "Power On".  The correct behavior is for both M2PA
peers to send a status "Out of Service" and enter the "Out of Service" state.
These test are useful both for Validation and Compatibility testing.
.sh 4 "Forward Direction"
.lp
The test is performed in the forward direction.
The expected sequence of events is illustrated \fI\*(&f\n(&n\fR.

.sh 3 "Timer T1 & Timer T4 (Normal)"
.lp
This test validates the T4(Normal) (Proving) and T1 (Aligned Ready) timers and
procedures at the IUT.  T4 is the duration of time that the M2PA peer will
wait to complete proving.  T1 is the duration that the M2PA peer will wait to
receive a status "Ready" or a status "Processor Outage" message from the
M2PA peer after sending a status "Ready" or status "Processor Outage"
message.

.sh 2 "Transmission Failure"
.lp
This set of test cases validate specific transmission path failures and
anomalies.  Specifically transmission path failures, corrupt acknowledgments
and invalid sequencing.  Because SCTP does not have a transmission path that
is separate from a receive path, the Q.781 tests that validate response to
breaking the transmission path are simulated by aborting the association.
Because M2PA does not have forward indicator bits, the Q.781 tests that
validate response to abnormal forward indicator bits are simulated by invalid
"Data Ack" messages.
.sh 3 "Link aligned ready (Abort)"

This case validates the response of the IUT to aborting the SCTP association
