\fIFigure \n(&p\fR illustrates an overview of the data model for the Application
Server.  Each SS7 user can send and receive message via multiple gateways\*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
There is a minor difference here for M2UA, which does not have the concept of
being able to bind to multiple gateways.  This is because SS7 links are
terminated on a single gateway for M2UA.  Nevertheless, the model which works
for mulitple gateways will also work for M2UA's single gateway case.
.)d 7
Each gateway is composed of multiple Signalling Gateway Processes, but each
Signalling Gateway Process can only belong to one Signalling Gateway.  Each
Signalling Gateway Process (SGP) is associated with one and only one Transport
Provider connection.

\fIFigure \n(&p\fR illustrates the situation at the Signalling Gateway.  Each
SS7 Provider is associated with one or more\*#
.(d
.ip \*#
There is no need to associate more than one SS7 Provider with an Application
Server, except in the case of M2UA.  Even this, however, can be avoid in M2UA,
where the assignment of multiple IIDs per Application Server is just as a
convenience for activating multiple linksets.
.)d 7
Application Servers.  An
Application Server has a unique Routing Key associated with it.  There is one
Routing Context assignment per Application Server Process.  Each Application
Server can be represented through multiple Application Server Processes, each
of which correspond directly to a Transport Provider connection.
.sh 1 "Local Management"
.lp
Before an SS7 User can use the services of an SS7 Provider, the User must be
sasociated with the Provider.  This is accomplished by attaching or binding
the SS7 User to an SS7 Provider.  The attach or bind is performed at the
discretion of the SS7 User.
.sh 2 "Local Management of the SS7 User Interface"
.lp
.sh 3 "Openining an SS7 User Interface"
.lp
When an SS7 User Interface is created, it is treated similar to an Application
Server Process (ASP) Proxy.  Two datastructures are created:
.ip "\f(TI\)SS7 User Interface Structure\f(TR\)"

.ip "\f(TI\)ASP Proxy Structure\f(TR\)"

.sh 3 "Binding an SS7 User Interface"
.lp
SS7 Users attach or bind using a Routing (Link) Key.
.lp
For example, an M2UA
.[
m2ua-11
.]
SS7 Signalling Link User attaches using a Signalling Data Terminal Identifier
and a Signalling Data Link Identifier.  These two identifiers can be combined
into a single 32-bit identifier which uniquely describes the signalling link.
.lp
When the SS7 Signalling Link User attaches, it provides a Signalling Link
Interface Identifier (SDTI/SDLI) as an argument of the attach.
.lp
As another example, an M3UA
.[
m3ua-10
.]
SS7 User binds its interface using a Bind request that includes the local
address (NI/PC/UP) to which the SS7 User is binding.  This is equivalent to an
M3UA
.[
m3ua-10
.]
Routing Key.
.lp
SUA and TUA are similar.
.lp
The sequence of events that follow the attach request are as follows:
.np
The SS7 User issues the Attach or Bind request and provides the parameters
necessary to build a Routing (Link) Key.
.np
The RK is compared against the RKs of statically and dynamically provisioned
Application Servers (AS).
.np
If a statically or dynamically provisioned AS exists that has a matching key,
the SS7 User Interface is associated with that Application Server.
.np
If no Application Server exists with the necessary key, and the implementation
permits dynamic registration, then an Application Server (AS) is dynamically
allocated, and an attempt is make to register the associated Routing (Link)
key with all the configured Signalling Gateways that wild-card match against
that key.
.lp
Note that it is not necessary to wait for a successful registration before
returning success on the attach or bind.
.ip "M2UA" 6
For M2UA, the attach succeeds and registration is only necessary before an
enable is confirmed.
.ip "M3UA" 6
For M3UA, the bind succeeds.  Only once registration and activation is
complete and a successful audit has occured will the MTP User be permitted to
send messages.
.ip "SUA" 6
For SUA, the bind succeeds.  Only once registration and activation is complete
and successful will the SCCP User be permitted to send messages.
.ip "TUA" 6
For TUA, the bind succeeds.  Only once registration and activation is complete
and successful will the TCAP User be permitted to begin transctions.
.lp
The result of the attach or bind operation is that the SS7 User Interface is
associated with an Application Server and that Application Server is
associated with one or more Signalling Gateways.
.lp
For this operation to be peformed, the Application Server Process (ASP) needs
to have a number of things provisioned:
.np a
Signalling Gateways must be configured and the transport connections to SGP
that make up the SG established.
.np
Each SG that supports dynamic registration must have a wildcard mask or list
of supported RKs associated with it when it is configured at the ASP, or, a
control stream must be listening for queries based on RK to determine the SG
to which the SS7 User Interface should be associated.\*#
.(d
.ip \*#
This last one is much better.  There is little difference between the
registration process at the SG and the registration process at the ASP.  At
the SG, the RK in the registration request must be resolved to a RC that
identifiers an SS7 Provider.  At the ASP, the RK that will go in a
registration request must be resolved to an SG to which to send the request.
.)d
.np
Each SG that is statically configured must have a list of RKs and RCs
associated wtih it (i.e, the Application Server datastructures as
pre-configured against the SG), or, a control stream can be listening for
registration requests in the same fashion as for dynamic registration above.
.lp
Placing registration under the control of the Layer Manager (control stream),
the attach/bind process would look like this:
.np
The local SS7 User Interface issues an attach/bind request.
.np
The kernel searches the list of existing Application Server structures and
determines if a match exists for the routing key.  If a match exists, the SS7
User Interface is associated with the Application Server.

If the AS is for M2UA, that is all that is done.  Activation does not occur
until the link is enabled.
If the AS is for another UA, activation is initiated.
.np
If an existing Application Server match is not found, the kernel creates a new
Application Server structure and then formulates a registration request to
layer management on the control stream.

The layer management process takes the registration request and examines it.

The Layer Manager forms the transport connection to the distant endpoint.
.np
The LM passes the transport connection to the kernel.  For OpenSS7, this is
performed by \f(CR\)I_LINK\f(TR\)ing or \f(CR\)I_PLINK\f(TR\)ing the transport
STREAM under the UA multiplexing driver.  The multiplexing driver does not
know at this time whether the transport connection is an ASP or and SGP mode
connection.
.np
The Layer Manager is aware of the aspect of the transport connection from
internal configuration.  That is, the LM knows if the transport connection is
a connection to an SGP.\*#
.(d
The LM does not normally form connections to ASP, normally the LM listens for
connection from ASP.
.)d
.np
The LM indicates to the kernel, the mode of the transport connection along
with an ASP Identifier.  This is performed using the
\f(CR\)LM_LINK_ADD_REQ\f(TR\) primitive.
.np
The \f(CR\)LM_LINK_ADD_REQ\f(TR\) primitve cause the multiplexing driver to
set the mode of the linked transport connection.  An SGP proxy structure is
located.  If no SGP proxy structure can be located, the request fails.  The LM
must ensure that an SGP proxy structure exists and is associated with an SG
structure before issuing the \f(CR\)LM_LINK_ADD_REQ\f(TR\) primitive.
.lp
The driver then initiates the following sequence of events:
.np
The driver sends an \f(CR\)ASPUP REQ\f(TR\) message on the transport
connection.  If the ASP Identifier in the associated SG structure was set to
'0', no ASP Identifier is sent in the \f(CR\)ASPUP REQ\f(TR\) message; if it
is non-zero, the ASP Identifier from the SG structure is used as the ASP
Identifier in the \f(CR\)ASPUP REQ\f(TR\) message.  The driver must receive a
successful \f(CR\)ASPUP ACK\f(TR\) message for the connection and move to the
\f(CR\)ASP-INACTIVE\f(CR\) state before other actions are performed.
.np
When the above procedure has completed successfully, the driver commences
registration of all AS that are defined in the driver and associated with the
associated SG structure if the SG structure is marked for dynamic
registration.  For each AS configured against the SG, a \f(CR\)REG REQ\f(TR\)
message is send and a successful \f(CR\)REG RSP\f(TR\) message expected.
.np
When the above procedure has completed successfully for a given AS, the driver
commences activation of the AS.  There are several circumstances, however, in
which activation is not performed automatically:
.(l
.ad l
.hy 0
.nr |p \n($p
.nr $p 0
.ba +\w'\0(000)\0'u
.bu
The AS is an over-ride AS and there is already an SGP that is ACTIVE for this
AS.  In this case, the driver determines whether the newly available SGP is of
a lower cost than the existing ACTIVE ASP.  If this is the case, the driver
may activate the newly available SGP.  Before performing such a switch-over;
however, the HEARTBEAT procedure should be used to clear messages to the old
SGP before starting traffic on the new SGP.
.bl
.bu
The AS already has an SGP that is ACTIVE for this AS in the same load
selection group.
.ba -\w'\0(000)\0'u
.nr $p \n(|p
.rr |p
.)l
.np
When activation completes successfully, the SGP is marked ACTIVE for the AS
which has activated and the SGP takes part in the traffic mode selection for
the AS.
.lp
There are a number of messages that the driver may receive on the transport
connection before it has completed any of the above procedures.  These are:
.(l

.sh 4 "Accepting Transport Connection"
.lp
When the layer manager accepts a transport connection, it performs the
following actions:
.np
The Layer Manager accepts the transport connection from the distant endpoint.
.np
The Layer Manager might or might not be aware of the aspect of the transport
connection from internal configuration.  If the LM is aware of the aspect, it
is solely from transport endpoint information (e.g, remote IP address and
port number, local IP address and port number).
.ba +\w'\0(000)\0'u
.ip "ASP"
The LM accepts transport connections from ASP on demand.
.ip "SGP"
The LM does not normally accept transport connections from SGP.  The LM
normally forms transport connections to an SGP.
.ip "SPP"
The LM accepts transport connection from SPP (peers) when the remote SPP
starts up or recovers.

.sh 4 "Accepting an ASP Transport Connection"
.lp
\fIFigure \n(&p\fR illustrates the configuration when accepting an ASP
transport connection.  At the time that the transport connection is formed, it
may not be know what aspect (ASP, SGP or SPP\*#) the transport connection
represents.
.(d
.ip \*#
An SPP is a combination of an ASP and SGP which acts in the capacity
of both.  This can be accomplished by associating both an ASP and and
SGP datastructure with the SPP and discriminating messages to one or
the other.  The SIGTRAN UAs
.[
m2ua-11
.]
.[
m3ua-10
.]
.[
sua-09
.]
.[
tua-01
.]
are such that, except for data messages, it can always be determined
to which aspect (ASP or SGP) a message corresponds.  Data messages
will cause some problems.  It might be necessary to require that a
separate transport connection be established for each aspect, if only
to determine whether the data messages are bound for the ASP or SGP
component.  This is related to much of the discussion on ISPS and
peer-to-peer operation that occurred on the SIGTRAN WG list.
.)d
Because the datastructures are similar (almost identical) for ASP and SGP;
however, it is possible to allocate an SPP datastructure when the transport
connection is accepted/connected by local management.  For OpenSS7 this is
when the transport \fISTREAM\fR is \fCI_LINK\fRed or \fCI_PLINK\fRed under the
UA multiplexing driver.

.sh 4 "Accepting an SGP Transport Connection"
.sh 4 "Accepting an IPC Transport Connection"
.sh 1 "Transfer of Data Messages"
.lp
When Data Transfer Messages are exchanged between Signalling Gateway Processes
and Application Server Processes, any loadsharing which is involved is always
performed on the basis of the Signalling Link Selection field in the message.
This is because no other rational basis for loadsharing can be used which does
not disrupt the sequenced characteristics of an SLS flow.
.lp
Signalling Link Selection loadsharing for one User to Provider or Provider to
User flow does not have to be done is such a fashion that the entity selected
on the basis of SLS is the same entity which would be selected for another
User or Provider.  This is because the messages within an SLS flow only need
be sequence between User and Provider and not between Users nor between
Providers.
.lp
If traffic routing is changed due to outage situations (e.g. loss of a
Transport Connection, the prohibiting of a route), then the sender, whether
User or Provider, must either flush messages from the old flow using the BEAT
and BEAT ACK UA messages or withold traffic for a time period, before
restarting traffic on the new route.  This is to ensure that misequencing does
not occur at the distant end.  That is, it ensures that the head of traffic on
the new route does not overtake the tail of the traffic on the old route at
the receiver.
.lp
It is always the User or Provider function which is performing selection based
on Signalling Link Selection value which must perform this flushing or
withholding of traffic.
.sh 2 "Outgoing Data Messages"
.lp
Outgoing Data Messages must be dealt with both at the Application Server and
at the Signalling Gateway.  The data models described here are based on the

As illustrated in \fIFigure \n(&p\fR, the Application Server performs the
following functions on outgoing Data Transfer messages:
.np
The SS7 User supplies a Data Transfer message for delivery within the SS7
newtork.
.np
The SS7 User Interface selects an Application Server to process the outgoing
message.  For each SS7 interface there is one and only one Application Server.
When the SS7 User Interface is bound or attached and enabled, an Application
Server is associated with the user interface.  Each SS7 User Interface has an
associated Interface Id (IID) or Routing Context (RC) which was assigned to it
at the time that it was attached or bound.
.np
The UA checks the availability of outgoing routes via Signalling Gateways
which it has at its disposal and which it is registered with.  This is the
same set of Signalling Gateways with which the User was bound when the
interface (RC) was activated.  The selection of Signalling Gateway is on the
basis of loadsharing and routeset status.  If no Signalling Gateway has an
available route, the User is returned an immediate error message.  Loadsharing
is perfomed on the basis of the SLS value in the message (as SLS is the only
rational basis for loadsharing).  SG route availability is considered as the
aggregation of Signalling Gateway Process route availability.

In selecting a Signalling Gateway, the User associates the Routing Context it
uses via that Signalling Gateway\*#
.(d
.ip \*#
The Routing Context used here is the same Routing Context with with the User
registered with the Signalling Gateway to \fIreceive\fR traffic.
.)d 7
with the message.  This has no use within the Application Server, but is used
at the Signalling Gateway to screen and authorize outgoing messaging.
.np
After selecting a Signalling Gateway, the AS selects amongst the Signalling
Gateway Processes associated with that Signalling Gateway.  This selection is
based on loadsharing on SLS value, but may also be based on the availability
of routes via the different SGP.
.np
Once an SGP has been selected, there is a specific Transport Provider which is
associated with each SGP.  If the Transport Provider is an SCTP provider, the
stream used is selected on the basis of adding 1 to the SLS value in the
message.
.lp
For OpenSS7 Application Servers, this model does not reduce (except that the
SGP and Transport collapse into a single STREAM head), due to the need
to support multiple Signalling Gateways per User and multiple Signalling
Gateway Processes per SG.

As illustrated in \fIFigure \n(&p\fR, the Signalling Gateway performs the
following functions on outgoing Data Transfer messages:
.np 1
The provider applies the Routing Key to the traffic which results in a Routing
Context value.  For providers which bind specific Routing Keys at the
SS7-Provider level, there will be no need to apply the Routing Key, as the
SS7-Provider will perform that function.  The Routing Context will be
associated with the binding and will be associated with the message before
starting.
.np
The Routing Context associated with the message is used to select the
Application Server to which the message applies.  Each Routing Key binding
has exactly on Application Server.  For SS7 providers which bind, the
Application Server can be associated with the binding and there is no need to
index Application Server by Routing Context: the Routing Context is merely an
attribute of the Application Server, which is bound to the provider with the
Routing Key.
.np
The Application Server has a number of Application Server Processes associated
with it.  The Application Server selects the appropriate Application Server
Process by performing a selection algorithm according to the Application
Server's Traffic Mode Type and the state of each of the Application Server
Processes \fBwithin\fR the Application Server.
.np
The Application Server Process has one Transport Provider connection associated
with it.  The Application Server Process structure can be one and the same
with the Transport Provider structure.  When the Transport Provider is an SCTP
association, the stream selected can be based on the SLS value in the message.

For the OpenSS7 Signalling Gateway, the above model reduces to that shown in
\fIFigure \n(&p\fR.  Where each SS7-Provider STREAM is bound to the Routing Key
and the Routing Context is an attribute (identifier) of the Application
Server.  Messages coming off the SS7-Provider STREAM are immediately
associated with an Application Server structure.  The SG peforms the
Application Server's distribution algorithm by keeping the states of ASPs in
graph nodes between the AS structures and the ASP structures.  The only
rational basis for the Load-sharing algorithm is SLS value, so if Load-sharing
is required, the SLS value in the message is used to select an active ASP.  If
Override algorithm is being used, the message is routed to the current master
ASP, and if Broadcast algorithm is being used, the message is sent to each of
the Active ASPs.
.lp
For the OpenSS7 SG, the ASP structure is associated with the Transport Service
Provider STREAM, and the STREAM to use is immediately discernable.  The
message is put on the queue associated with the ASP.  The stream selected (if
the transport provider is an SCTP provider) is the SLS contained in the
message + 1.  (Stream `0' is reserved for ASP manaagement messages.)

For OpenSS7, this simplifies greatly at the Signalling Gateway because the
Transport Provider connection and the Application Server Process (ASP) can be
collapse in to the same STREAM queue-pair.  Also the Application Server and
the SS7 Provider can also be collapsed into the same STREAM queue-pair.  A
directed graph is used between the two.
.lp
As illustrated in \fIFigure \n(&p\fR, for OpenSS7, the ASP structure is
associated with the Transport Service Provider STREAM, and a graph is used to
look up the Routing Context associated with the message to select the
appropriate Application Server.
.lp
For OpenSS7, the Application Server is bound directly to the SS7 Provider
STREAM and the message is transfer to the SS7-Provider.

Under the current OpenSS7 mode, however, multiple Routing Contexts will never
be included in the message.  Instead, mutliple SNMM messages, one for each
Routing Context will be sent.  The nature of the STREAMS model is such that
a Transport Provider will have the ablity to bundle these messages together
into a single transmission.

\fIFigure \n(&p\fR illustrates the steps that the Signalling Gateway goes through
to generate an SNM message and transfer it to the Application Server.
The process is almost identical to the process used for outgoing data
transfer; however, it differs in the selection of ASP.
The Signalling Gateway performs the following functional steps on the message:
.np
The provider determines the Signalling Point Management Cluster to which the
SNMM message corresponds.  The provider then looks up the list of Application
Servers which belong to the Signalling Point Management Cluster.  It compiles
a list of Routing Contexts which it uses for sending the SNM message.

For providers which are bound to a Routing Key, the provider will determine
the list of Application Servers automatically and provide an SNMM indication
to each of the Application Servers.
.np
The Routing Context(s) associated now with the message is used to select the
Application Server(s) to which the message applies.  Each Routing Context has
exactly one Application Server.  For SS7 providers which bind, the Application
Server is associated with the binding and there is no need to index the
Application Server by Routing Context.  Each Application Server will receive
the appropriate SNMM indication with its Routing Context as a key.
.np
The Application Server(s) have a number of Application Server Processes
associated with them.  Each Application Server selects the appropriate
Application Server Processes by considering the selection algorithm according
to the Application Server's Trafic Mode Type and the state of each of the
Application Server Processes \fBwithin\fR each Application Server.

It is important to note that SNM messages should be sent to all Active
Application Server Processes, regardless of whether the ASP is in standby or
not.  This is because of restart procedures.  ASPs are given all pertinent
SNM messages when they move to the Active state, but after that point, they
must keep their management configuration up to date by receiving managemnt
messages.  For M2UA,
.[
m2ua-11
.]
only one Application Server Process is active at one time.
.np
The Application Server Process has only one Transport Provider connection
associated with it.  The Application Server Process structure can be one and
the same with the Transport Provider structure.  When the Transport Provider
is an SCTP association, the stream selected and whether the Unordered bit is
set on the message is determined.  Transport Providers supporting expedited
data transfer to the medium may be invoked with expedited data for some SNM
messages.

\fIFigure \n(&p\fR illustrates the steps that the Application Server goes through

At the Application Server, the processing of outgoing SNM messages is almost
identical to that for Data Transfer messages, with the exception being SGP
selection.
The Application Server performs the following functional steps on the message:
.np
The Application Server receiving a SNM from a User checks the activity of all
registered SGs and selectes each of the SGs which are actively transferring
traffic to the User\*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
Note that for M2UA
.[
m2ua-11
.]
there is only ever one SG and one SGP which are active for a given Interface
Identifier.
.)d 7
The AS associates the Routing Context of each SG and
associates it with the message.
.np
After selection of Signalling Gateway(s), the AS selects amongst the
Signalling Gateway Processes associated with those Signalling Gateways.  This
selection is based on activity: that is, all SGPs which are actively
transferring traffic to the AS are selected.
.np
Once the set of SGP have been selected, there is a specific Transport Provider
associated with each of the SGP selected.  The message is transmitted with the
associated Routing Context to each of the Transport Providers selected.  If
the Transport Provider is an SCTP provider, the stream used and the decision
to use the Unordered bit is based upon the type of the SNM message.

received from the AS are purely advisory, and ill advised.  SCTP congestion
towards the User process (from the User process failing to service its SCTP
receive buffer, resulting in a small receive window) is a far better
indication of User congestion.  User congestion will be signalled in that case
back to the SS7 Provider because the queues will back up that far.  The SS7
provider can then determine the appropriate action (probably sending TFC for
the affected users upon receipt of messages below a given priority.)

\fIFigure \n(&p\fR illustrates the steps that the Application Server goes through
when it receives an SNM message from the Signalling Gateway.
The process is almost identical to the Data Transfer process.
The Application Server performs the following functional steps on the message:
.np
The Transport Provider connection upon which the SNM Message is receive
determines both the Signalling Gateway Process (SGP) and the Signalling
Gateway (SG) which are to be used for the message.
.np
The AS, upon determining the SGP and SG, store whatever state information
concerning the Management message that is necessary as this may have a bearing
on routeing of outgoing data messages.
.np
Once the Signalling Gateway upon which the message has arrived has been
determined by the Application Server, the AS choses the SS7 User to send the
message to based on the Routing Context which appears in the message.  Note,
however, that the Routing Context must be considered in the context of the
Signalling Gateway upon which it was received.
