.uh "Abstract"
.lp
This Internet Draft describes an algorithm for the tracking and generation of
SACK Gap and Duplicate TSN reports.  This algorithm has been implemented in the
OpenSS7 Linux Kernel implementation
of SCTP.
.[
RFC 2960
.]

.sh 1 "Introduction"

This internet-draft provides an algorithm for tracking gap and duplicate TSN
SACK reports for the Stream Control Transmission Protocol as described in.
.[
RFC 2960
.]

There are several difficulties to consider when attempting implementation of the
Gap and Duplicate TSN reports in SCTP:

.ip i) 5
The algorithm must support a quick determination of whether the TSN is a
duplicate TSN.
.ip ii) 5
The algorithm must support a quick determination of whether the TSN falls within
an existing SACK'ed TSN range.
.ip iii) 5
The algorithm must support counting duplicates accumulated over a number of SCTP
messages but be able to be cleared quickly as a Duplicate TSN report is
generated.
.ip iv) 5
The algorithm must support on demand generation of Gap Reports.
.ip v) 5
The algorithm must consume a finite and bounded amount of memory.
.ip vi) 5
The algorithm must smoothly interwork with the SCTP's procedures.
.lp
The algortihm presented in this internet-draft attempts to meet all of these
objectives and provide a compact solution.
