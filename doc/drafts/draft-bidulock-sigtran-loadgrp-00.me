.sh 2 "Overview"
.lp
Existing UA procedures with regard to traffic distribution and ASP traffic
management provide a mechanism to select the algorithm for coordinating state
and distributing traffic over a number of Application Server Processes (ASPs)
serving an Application Server.  These existing procedures provide only
simplified distribution approaches which are not ammeniable to large scale
systems that need to adapt to dynamic traffic loading or need live
reconfiguration for maintenance purposes.

permits close control over the grouping of Application Server Processes
serving an Application Server that provides the following capability not
existing in the current scheme:

.ip "Grouping of ASPs into Load Groups"
Under the existing approach, each Application Server Process acts
independently with respect to an Application Server.  This approach does not
provide for the grouping of ASPs into workgroups, not does it provide
coordintaed control of the role of groups of ASPs serving an ASP.  As a
result, the existing scheme does not scale well in this regard.

This extension draft provides for the grouping of ASPs into load groups with a
traffic distribution mode (Load Distribution) within the load group that is
independent of the Application Sever traffic mode.

.lp
\fI\*(&f\n(&p\fR illustrates the existing traffic distribution algorithm that
is used across the Signalling User Adaptation Layers.
.lp
When an SGP distributes a Signalling User Adaptation Layer message towards the
Application Server based on the Routing (Link) Key, it selects an ASP that is
active for the AS according to a Traffic Mode Type that is associated with the
AS.  The Traffic Mode Type describes three general distribution algorithms:
Override, Loadshare and Broadcast.
.lp
The detailed actions taken for these distribution algorithms are described in
Section 4 of the Signalling User Adaptation Layer specifications;

.[

however, they can be summarized as follows:
.lp
.b "Traffic Mode Type Override:\-\ "
.ix +\n(iiu
When distributing messages to an Override Application Server, the SGP selects
the ASP which is active for the Application Server.  In an Override
Application Server, at most one ASP can be active for the AS at any given point
in time.  The active ASP for the AS is selected.
.lp
.b "Traffic Mode Type Loadshare:\-\ "
.ix +\n(iiu
When distributing messages to a Loadshare Application Server, the SGP selects
one of the ASPs that are active for the Application Server using an
implementation dependent loadsharing algorithm based on some unspecified
aspect of the traffic or static configuration data.
.lp
.b "Traffic Mode Type Broadcast:\-\ "
.ix +\n(iiu
When distributing messages to a Broadcast Application Server, the SGP sends a
copy of the message to each of the ASPs that are active for the Application
Server.  (The ASPs themselves decide which, if any, of the ASPs will process
the message.)
.lp
In general, for the Signalling User Adapatation Layers, the Traffic Mode Type
is a characteristic of the Application Server, and an Application Server can
only have associated with it only one Traffic Mode Type, and thus, only one
traffic distribution algorithm can be used across the ASPs that are serving a
given Application Server.
.lp
This extension document enhances the traffic distribution algorithms of the
existing Signalling User Adaptation Layers by introducing an additional level
of distribution.

.#f "Load Group Traffic Distribution"
.)z
.lp
\fI\*(&f\n(&p\fR illustrates the extended traffic distribution algorithms that
are used across the Signalling User Adaptation Layers as a result of the
messages and procedures in this extension.
.lp
This extension introduces the concept of a \fI\)Load Group\fR.  A \fI\)Load
Group\fR is a logical grouping of Application Server Processes (ASPs) into
traffic groups serving an Application Server.
Signalling Gateway Processes (SGPs) distribute traffic first over \fI\)Load
Groups\fR and then distribute traffic within the \fI\)Load Group\fR.  Each
\fI\)Load Group\fR describes and is identified by a \fI\)Load Selection\fR
.[
loadsel-00
.]
within the Application Server.  The \fI\)Load Selection\fR identifies the
traffic flows that will be distributed to an associated \fI\)Load Group\fR
within an Application Server.
.lp
When an SGP distributes a Signalling User Adaptation Layer message towards an
Application Server based on the Routing (Link) Key, it first selects an
\fI\)Load Group\fR that is active for the Application Server according a
traffic distribtuion algorithm determined by the \fI\)Load Distribution\fR
that is associated with the Application Server and the \fI\)Load Selection\fR
position of the \fI\)Load Group\fR within the AS.
.lp
The Traffic Mode Type continues to describe three general distribution
algorithms: Override, Loadshare and Broadcast.  The change in the behavior of
the SGP when selecting an ASP for traffic distribution introduced by this
extension is that the SGP also takes into account the concept of a \fI\)Load
Group\fR as identified within an AS by its \fI\)Load Selection\fR.
.lp
The extended procedures can be summarized as follows:
.lp
.b "Traffic Mode Type Override:\-\ "
.ix +\n(iiu
When distributing messages to an Override Application Server, the SGP first
selects the \fI\)Load Group\fR that is active for the Application Server.  In
an Override Application Server, at most one \fI\)Load Group\fR can be active
for the AS at any given point in time.  The active \fI\)Load Group\fR for the
AS is selected.
.lp
.b "Traffic Mode Type Loadshare:\-\ "
.ix +\n(iiu
When distributing messages to a Loadshare Application Server, the SGP selects
one of the \fI\)Load Groups\fR that are active for the Application Server
using an implementation dependent loadsharing algorithm based on the \fI\)Load
Selection\fR
.[
loadsel-00
.]
associated with the \fI\)Load Group\fR.
.lp
.b "Traffic Mode Type Broadcast:\-\ "
.ix +\n(iiu
When distrbuting messages to a Broadcast Application Server, the SGP sends a
copy of the message to each of the \fI\)Load Groups\fR that are active for the
Application Server.  (The \fI\)Load Groups\fR themselves decide which, if any,
of the \fI\)Load Groups\fR will process the message.)
.lp
After selecting an \fI\)Load Group\fR according to the \fI\)Traffic Mode
Type\fR for the Application Server, the SGP then selects an ASP within the
\fI\)Load Group\fR based on the \fI\)Load Distribution\fR that is associated
with the \fI\)Load Group\fR.  The \fI\)Load Distribution\fR describes the same
three general distribution algorithms that are provided in the \fI\)Traffic Mode
Type:\fR Override, Loadshare and Broadcast.  When selecting an active ASP
within a \fI\)Load Group\fR, the procedures that the SGP will follow can be
summarized as follows:
.lp
.b "Load Distribution Override:\-\ "
.ix +\n(iiu
When distributing messages within an Override Load Group, the SGP selects the
ASP which is active for the Load Group.  In an Override Load Group, at most
one ASP can be active for the \fI\)Load Group\fR at any given point in time.
The active ASP for the \fI\)Load Group\fR is selected.
.lp
.b "Load Distribution Loadshare:\-\ "
.ix +\n(iiu
When distributing messages within a Loadshare Load Group, the SGP selects one
of the ASPs that are active for the Load Group using an implementation
dependent loadsharing algorithm based on some unspecified aspect of the
traffic or static configuration data.
.lp
.b "Load Distribution Broadcast:\-\ "
.ix +\n(iiu
When distributing messages within a Broadcast Load Group, the SGP sends a copy
of the message to each of the ASPs that are active for the Load Group.  (The
ASPs themselves decide which, if any, of the APSs will process the message.)
.lp
The result of this extension is that two levels of traffic distribution are
provided for, permitting more flexible membership of ASPs serving Application
Servers, and provides the Application Server Process with more control over
the traffic patterns for which it is active.
.sh 2 "Sample Configurations"
.lp
Although this extension does not restrict either Traffic Mode Type or Load
Distribution to a static assignment, there are, for example, six (6)
combinations of static Traffic Mode Type and Load Distribution assignment
under this scheme.  Not all of these combinations provide for interesting or
useful configurations as follows:

to further refine the traffic distribution algorithm for an ASP in a \fI\)Load
Group\fR serving an Application Server.  The \fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter
identifies the \fI\)Load Group\fR for which the ASP is registering, activating

.sh 1 "Procedures"
.lp
This \fI\)Load Grouping\fR extension provides for an additional level of
control over the traffic distribution patterns within an Application Server.
This extension provides the \fI\)Load Distribution\fR parameter which may be
optionally included in the \fB\)REG REQ\fR, \fB\)ASPAC\fR and \fB\)ASPAC
ACK\fR messages.  In addition, it supplements the ASP State Maintenance and
ASP Traffic Maintenance procedures.
.sh 2 "ASP State Maintenance"
.lp
In addition to the SGP mainting the state of each remote ASP in each
Application Server that the ASP is configured to receive traffic, under this
extension, the SGP \fB\)MAY\fR also maintain the state of each remote ASP in
each \fI\)Load Group\fR within an Application server that the ASP is
configured to receive traffic.  The \fI\)Load Group\fR state is maintained
separate from the ASP and AS states.
.sh 3 "Load Group State"
.lp
The state of the \fI\)Load Group\fR is maintained in the Signalling User
Adaptation Layer on the SGPs.  The state of the \fI\)Load Group\fR changes due
ASP state transitions.  The possible states of a \fI\)Load Group\fR are:
.ip "\fB\)LG-DOWN\fR:" 16
The \fI\)Load Group\fR is unavaialble.  This state implies that all related
ASPs are in the \fB\)ASP-DOWN\fR state for this \fI\)Load Group\fR.
Initially, the \fI\)Load Group\fR will be in this state.
.ip "\fB\)LG-INACTIVE\fR:" 16
The \fI\)Load Group\fR is available but no application traffic is active (i.e,
one or more related ASPs are in the \fB\)ASP-INACTIVE\fR state, but none are
in the \fB\)ASP-ACTIVE\fR state within the \fI\)Load Group\fR).
.ip "\fB\)LG-ACTIVE\fR:" 16
The \fI\)Load Group\fR is available and application traffic is active.  This
state implies that at least one ASP is in the \fB\)ASP-ACTIVE\fR state within
the \fI\)Load Group\fR.
.sh 3 "Application Server State"

.sh 2 "ASP Traffic Maintenance"
.sh 3 "ASP Active Procedures"
.lp
This \fI\)Load Grouping\fR extension supplements the ASP Active Procedures as
follows:
.lp
When an ASP sends an \fB\)ASPAC\fR message to activate the ASP within an
Application Server, the ASP \fB\)MAY\fR choose to activate within a \fI\)Load
Group\fR for the specified AS by including the \fI\)Load Selection\fR
parameter in the \fB)ASPAC\fR message.
.lp
When an SGP receives an \fB\)ASPAC\fR message with a \fI\)Load Selection\fR
parameter in the message, or where the SGP is otherwise configured to activate
the ASP in a configured \fI\)Load Group\fR, when the SGP moves the ASP to the
ASP-ACTIVE state for the AS, it also moves the ASP to the ASP-ACTIVE state for
the \fI\)Load Group\fR identified by the \fI\)Load Selector\fR field in the
\fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter.  In either case, if the activation is
successful, the SGP includes the \fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter in the
\fB\)ASPAC ACK\fR message.
.lp
If the \fI\)Load Selector\fR in the \fB\)ASPAC\fR message is invalid, the SGP
responds with ERR("Error - Invalid Load Selector").  If the \fI\)Load
Selection\fR parameter is not present in the \fB\)ASPAC\fR message and the SGP
is configured to require one, or the \fI\)Load Selector\fR field is not valid
or unconfigured for the Application Server, the SGP responsds with ERR("Error
- Unsupported/Unconfigured/Missing Load Selector").  If the \fI\)Load
Selection\fR parameter contains an invalid or unsupported \fI\)Load
Distribution\fR value, or the \fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter is missing but
the SGP cannot determine the distribution applicable to the \fI\)Load Group\fR
without one, the SGP response with ERR("Error - Invalid/Unsupported/Missing
Load Distribution").
.lp
There are three modes of Application Server traffic handling in the SGP at the
Application Server level and three modes of AS traffic handling at the Load
Group level: Override, Loadshare and Broadcast.  When included, the
\fI\)Traffic Mode Type\fR parameter in the \fB\)ASPAC\fR message indicates the
traffic handling mode to be used in a particular Application Server between
Load Groups.  When included, the \fI\)Load Distribution\fR field in the
\fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter indicates the traffic handling mode to be
used between ASPs within a Load Group.
.lp
In the case of an Override mode AS, reception of an ASP Active message at an
SGP may move a \fI\)Load Group\fR to the LG-ACTIVE state.  When an LG moves
to the LG-ACTIVE state in an Override mode AS, this causes the (re)direction
of all traffic for the AS to the active Load Group.
Distribution of traffic within the Load Group is determine on the basis of the
Load Distribution mode of the Load Group.
Any previously active Load Group is now considered to be in state LG-INACTIVE
and \fB\)SHOULD\fR no longer receive traffic from the SGP within the AS.
The SGP then \fB\)MUST\fR send a Notify message ("Alternate ASP Active") and
include the \fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter in the Notify message indicating
the \fI\)Load Group\fR that has become active.
.lp
In the case of a Loadshare mode AS, the reception of an ASP Active message at
an SGP that moves a \fI\)Load Group\fR to the LG-ACTIVE state causes the
direction of specific traffic flows associated with the \fI\)Load Selector\fR
to the \fI\)Load Group\fR.  The assignment of traffic flows to \fB\)Load
Selector\fR values is implementation depenedent, but could be based on
specific information in the protocol data message.
.lp
In the case of a Broadcast mode AS, reception of an ASP Active message at an
SGP that results in moving a \fI\)Load Group\fR to the LG-ACTIVE state within
the AS causes the direction of traffic to the newly active \fI\)Load Group\fR
in addition to all the other LGs that are currently active for the AS.  The
algorithm at the SGP for broadcasting traffic within an AS to all the active
ASPs is a simple broadcast algorithm, where every message is sent to each of
the active Load Groups.
.sh 3 "ASP Inactive Procedures"
.lp
This \fI\)Load Grouping\fR extension supplements the ASP Active procedures of
the UAs as follows:
.lp
When an ASP wishes to withdraw from a specific \fI\)Load Group\fR within an
Application Server, the ASP sends an ASP Inactive message to the SGP with a
\fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter included in the message.  In the case where
the ASP does not include the \fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter in the ASP
Inactive message, the SGP must know via configuration data which Load Groups
the ASP is a member.  Upon receiving an ASP Inactive message with included
or implied \fI\)Load Selection(s)\fR, the SGP moves the ASP to the
ASP-INACTIVE state in each of the Load Groups indicated.

.sh 2 "Registration"
.lp
UAs permit Application Server Processes to register for the Routing Context
(Interface Identifier) associated with a Routing Key (Link Key).  This draft
extends the registration procedure to also permit the Application Server
Process to register for a \fI\)Load Group\fR identifier in addition to the
Routing Contex/Interface Id.  This is performed using a \fI\)Load Group\fR which
has the same form as the Routing Key, but has some additional fields which are
only applicable to Loadsharing.
.lp
In addition to the normal registration procedures of the UAs, the following
additional error conditions can occur:
.ip "\fI""Error - Invalid Load Group""\fR"
This error \fB\)MUST\fR be sent in an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message if the SG
determines that the Load Group is invalid.
.ip "\fI""Error - Unsupported/Unconfigured Load Group""\fR"
This error \fB\)MUST\fR be sent in an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message whenever the
SG determines that the Load Group provided in a \fI\)REG REQ\fR message has
not be configured and the SG does not support dynamic allocation of Load
Selectors for the specified Key, and \fB\)MUST\fR be sent in an \fI\)Error
(ERR)\fR message whenever the SG determines that the Load Group provided in
a \fI\)REG REQ\fR message is not supported by the SG.
.ip "\fI""Error - Invalid/Unsupported/Missing Load Distribution""\fR"
This error \fB\)MUST\fR be sent in an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message whenever the
SG determines that the Load Distribution associated wtih a Load Group is
invalid, is not supported by the SG, or is required to determine the Load
Distribution algorithm of the \fI\)Load Group\fR but is missing from
the Load Group in the \fI\)REG REQ\fR message.
.sh 2 "ASP Activation"
.lp
When activating, this draft extends the UA activation procedures by permitting
an optional \fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter to be included in the ASP Active
(ASPAC) and ASP Active Ack (ASPAC ACK) messages.  The \fI\)Load Selection\fR
parameter is used to indicate for which \fI\)Load Group\fR the
concerned Application Server is becoming active.
.lp
Whenever the SG is unable to activate the ASP within the selected Application
Server \fI\)Load Group\fR, the SG \fB\)MUST\fR reply with an
\fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message containing one of the errors defined in the UA
documents\*(#u, or one of the following additional errors:
.ip "\fI""Error - Invalid Load Group Identifier""\fR"
.sh 2 "ASP Deactivation"
.lp
When deactivating, this draft extends the UA activation procedures by
permitting an optional \fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter to be included in the
ASP Inactive (ASPIA) and ASP Inactive Ack (ASPIA ACK) message.  The \fI\)Load
Selection\fR parameter is used to indicate for which traffic in the \fI\)Load
Group\fR the concerned Application Server is becoming inactive.
.sh 2 "ASP Failure"
.lp
When an ASP fails that was supporting load-sharing application servers, the
NTFY("ASP Failure")
.sh 2 "ASP Override"
.sh 2 "Notification"
.lp
When the SGP or IPSP notifies its UA peer with a NTFY messages which concerns
an ASP, it \fB\)MUST\fR include the \fI\)Load Group\fR (if available)
along with the ASP Identifier in the message.  The NTFY messages to which this
applies are:
.ip "\fI\)NTFY(""ASP Failure"") \-\fR"
When the SGP or IPSP notifies the active and inactive ASPs in an AS that it
has detected the failure of an ASP or the failure of an association to an ASP
(i.e. SCTP Communication Lost Indication), it \fB\)MUST\fR include the
\fI\)Load Group\fR (if available) with the ASP Identifier in the message.
When the Routing Context(s)/Interface Identifier(s) associated with the
Application Servers cannot be implied at the ASP from static configuration
data, the Routing Context/Interface Identifier(s) \fB\)MUST\fR also be placed
in the NTFY("ASP Failure") message.  The notifying SGP or IPSP \fB\)MAY\fR
also place the \fI\)Load Selection\fR parameter into the NTFY("ASP Failure")
message to indicate the traffic which was applicable to the load selection at
the time of the failure.

The purpose of this procedure is to inform the active and inactive ASPs, not
only of the ASP failure, but of the identity of the ASP and the load selection
for which the failed ASP was responsible.
.ip "\fI\)NTFY(""Alternate ASP Active in AS"") \-\fR"
When the SGP or IPSP notifies the previously active ASP in a override AS that
an alternate ASP has become active using the NTFY("Alternate ASP Active in
AS") message, it \fB\)MUST\fR include the \fI\)Load Group\fR (if
available) with the ASP Identifier in the message.
.lp
The purpose of this procedure is to inform the previously active ASP, not only
of the that another ASP has taken over the traffic for which the notified ASP
was previously responsible, but to also indicate the identify of the
overriding ASP and the load selection that was overridden.
