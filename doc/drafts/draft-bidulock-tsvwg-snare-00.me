capability over UDP for providing a subnetwork address resolution entity that
can provide X.25 CONS address discovery for the XOT

.sh 1 "IANA Considerations"
.pp
This memo requests the assignment of one UDP well-known port number and two IP
Multicast Addresses.
.sh 2 "IPv4 Multicast Addresses"
.pp
Two IP multicast addresses are to be assigned for this protocol:
.ip "\fB\)All CONS End System Address\fP"
This address is used for sending multicast UDP datagrams to all CONS end
systems on an IP subnetwork.
.ip "\fB\)All CONS SNARES Address\fP"
This address is used for sending multicast UDP datagrams to all CONS SNAREs on
an IP subnetwork.
.sh 2 "Port Number"
.pp
This memo allocates a well-known port number for use in listening for UDP
datagrams on multicast addresses and for exchanging SNARE messages between a
CONS End System and a SNARE Intermediate System.
