.[

.[

.[

procedures do not include procedures to avoid loss or duplication of messages
when a UA peer must fail-over between SCTP
.[
rfc2960
.]
associations between diverse Application Server Processes (ASPs), Signalling
Gateway Processes (SGPs), Signalling Gateways (SGs), and IP Signalling
Processes (IPSPs).
.pp
\fI\)CORID\fR provides procedures to eliminate message loss, duplication or
mis-sequencing under all failure, deactivation, recovery and activation
scenarios.
\fI\)CORID\fR provides the following capabilities that are
not provided for in the existing UA specifications:
.bu
Support for elimintating mis-sequencing of UA-User messages at signalling
endpoints (Application Servers or SS7 SEPs) when diverting messages between
ASPs, SGPs, SGs, or IPSPs by supporting \fI\)BEAT\fR procedures analogous to
the MTP3
.[
q704
.]
Changeback procedure.

.bu
Support for eliminating duplication of UA-User messages at signalling
endpoints (Application Servers or SS7 SEPs) or SS7 endpoints across fail-over
between ASPs, SGPs, SGs, or IPSPs.

.bu
Support for elimination of message loss of UA-User messages between Signalling
Gateways (SGs) and Application Servers (ASs) across fail-over between ASPs,
SGPs, SGs, or IPSPs.
.sh 3 "Configuration"
.pp
For carrier-class operation, the SS7 Signalling User Adaptation Layers
recommend that Signalling Gateways and Application Servers be configured such
that there is no single point of failure within the SG/AS architecture or in
the intervening network.  The SS7 UAs also recommend that no Application
Server be configured for less than two (2) Application Server Processes.
.pp
All of the UAs describe an override, loadsharing and broadcast traffic mode.
The UA protocols place no restrictions on the distribution algorithm which is
used for distributing traffic over multiple Signalling Processes.
Additional traffic distribution proposals have been put forward for Load Selection
.[
loadsel05
%Z 2
.]
and Load Grouping
.[
loadgrp05
%Z 2
.]
.pp
Fail-over between Application Server Processes (ASPs) and Signalling Gateway
Processes (SGPs) is not detailed in the UA protocols,
.[
m2ua-rfc
.]
.[
m3ua-rfc
.]
.[
sua-rfc
.]
.[
isua04
.]
.[

.]
but it is clear that when an SCTP association fails and the ASP transitions to
the ASP-DOWN state from the perspective of the SGP peer, the traffic which the
associated ASP was previously responsible needs to be diverted to an
alternate ASP (if available) in the same Application Server pool.
.sh 3 "Conditions at Fail-Over"
.pp
The details of this diversion of traffic is not specified, however, a
dichotomy exists when such fail-over occurs as a result of the loss of an SCTP
association between these Signalling Peer Processes (SPPs).  When an SPP loses its
SCTP association with another SPP, and diverts traffic towards another SPP,
there exists the possibility that messages previously destined to the peer SPP
exist in several categories, as follows:
.ip "Category (1) \-" 15
Queued in the sending SPP process,
.ip "Category (2) \-" 15
queued for transmission, but not yet transmitted by the transport provider
(SCTP),
.ip "Category (3) \-" 15
queued for retransmission, but not yet acknowledged by the peer transport
provider (SCTP), and,
.ip "Category (4) \-" 15
acknowledged by the peer transport provider (SCTP) and deleted from the
sending transport provider's (SCTP's) retransmission queue.

.#f "Buffer Categories at SCTP Association Failure"
.)b
.pp
These categories are illustrated in \fI\*(&f\n(&p\fR.
Note that to retransmit categories (2) and (3) (and perhaps categories (1)) on
another link requires sent data acknowledgment or buffer retrieval capability
by the underlying transport provider.
.pp
As there is no SPP peer-to-peer acknowledgement, for messages in Categories (3)
and (4), the message might or might not have been delivered to the peer SPP.
Therefore, at the time of failure of an SCTP association between two
Signalling Peer Processes (SPPs), it is not possible for either SPP to
determine which of the messages in categories (3) and (4) above (transmitted,
but not yet acknowledged; transmitted and acknowledged) were successfully
received by the peer before failure.  Without information concerning which
messages in this category were successfully received by the peer, the SPP
either risks message loss or message duplication when it diverts traffic from
the failed association.
.sh 3 "Sources of Message Loss and Duplication"
.pp
If the messages from category (3) or (4) are retransmitted on an alternate
association, the SPP diverting the traffic risks message duplication.  This is
because some messages of the category might possibly have been successfully
received by the peer before fail-over.
.pp
If the messages from category (3) and (4) are discarded before diverting
messages from categories (1) and (2) and then new traffic on an alternate
association, the SPP risks message loss.  This is because some of the messages
in category (3) and (4) might possibly have \fInot\fR been received by the
peer SPP before the association failed.
.pp
This is the dychotomy: regardless of the nature of a policy concerning the
disposition of messages at an SPP experiencing failure to its peer, without
information concerning messages successfully received by the peer, the SPP
risks message loss or duplication.
.pp
It should be possible to induce such a system to demonstrate message loss or
duplication.
.pp
Because SS7 performance requirements
.[
ss7perf
%Z 2
.]
have more stringent requirements against duplication of messages than loss of
messages, the only policy is to discard messages in category (3).
.pp
To avoid loss of messages to meet SS7 performance requirements
.[
ss7perf
.]
in consideration of this dichotomy, implementation cost may be driven higher than
would be the case if a procedure were established to exchange information
between the Signalling Processes on either side of a failed association.
.pp
This Internet-Draft provides Correlation Id and Heartbeat procedures
for fail-over for the SS7 signalling UAs which will remove the possibility of
message loss or duplication in the event that an SCTP association failure
while communication between the Application Server and Signalling Gateway is
still possible.

.#f "Example (A) Configuration of ASPs and SGPs"
.)b
.pp
\fI\*(&f\n(&p\fR illustrates an example (A) configuration of ASPs and SGPs.
In this example, the ASP and SGP are interconnected with a full-mesh
arrangement of SCTP Associations.  Each ASP is interconnected to each SGP by
an association.
.pp
When a failure of the SCTP assocation occurs, it is, for example, between
`SGP1' and `ASP1' as indicated by the (X) in the \fI\*(&f\n(&p\fR.  When a
recovery occurs, it is also the SCTP association between `SGP1' and `ASP1'
that recovers.
.pp
The normal procedure for dealing with such a failure\*#

As described in the UA documents.

the remaining ASPs in the Application Server\*#.

once ASP1 has entered the ASP-ACTIVE state for the AS, message mis-sequencing
can occur if traffic is immediately applied on the newly active association.
.pp
The UA procedures\*(#u provide no detail concerning the restarting of traffic
to recovering ASPs in the AS.
.sh 3 "Sources of Message Mis-Sequencing"
.pp
Because the SGPs can be experiencing different loads or other local factors,
each SGP may differ.  Therefore, restoring a traffic flow to a newly active
SGP, without first ensuring that messages are purged through the old path
before the diversion, can result in message mis-sequencing.  This is example
(C) illustrated in \fI\*(&f\n(&n\fR.

.#f "Example (C) Restoration of a Traffic Flow"
.)b
.pp
Before switching traffic back to SGP1 from SGPx, SGPx is queueing traffic
from ASP1 to the SS7 network.
(This queueing could either be within the SGP or as a result of queueing
within the transport protocol.)
.[
rfc2960
.]
If the traffic flow from ASP1 is switched rapidly to SGP1, a race condition
exists between messages in SGPx's queue and messages in SGP1's queue.  A rapid
switch can result in mis-sequencing.
.pp
As SGPx and SGP1 do not necessarily have to belong to the same SG (and
because there exists queuing within the transport protocol itself), close
queue synchornization between SGPx and SGP1 cannot be expected.
.pp
\fI\)CORID\fR provides both a time-controlled and a Heartbeat procedure for
restoration of traffic to avoid mis-sequencing during restoration.
.sh 2 "Functional Areas"
.pp
The \fI\)CORID\fR procedures to avoid message loss, duplication and
mis-sequencing under these types of scenarios requires protocol parameters
that provide a clear identification of the independent traffic flows involved.
Then, procedures are required to control the fail-over and restoration of the
identified traffic flows to avoid message loss.
.pp
The SS7 MTP3
.[
q704
.]
provide an excellent example of the types of procedures that can be applied to
the problem of switching traffic flows across redundant processes\*#.
.(d
.#v

See, for example, Clause 5 "Changeover", Clause 6 "Changeback", Clause 7
"Forced Rerouting" and Clause 8 "Controlled Rereouting" of the MTP3
specifications.
.[

.]
.)d
.sh 3 "Identification of Traffic Flows"
.pp
Traffic flows between Server Processes in the UAs are managed on the basis of
the Application Server to which the traffic flows correspond.  Traffic flows
from SG to AS are identified by the \fI\)Routing Key\fR or \fI\)Routing
Context\fR to which they correspond\*#.
.(d
.#v

This is true for all User Adaptation layers with the exception of M2UA.

In M2UA, the Application Server and traffic flows are identified by an
equivalent of the \fI\)Routing Key\fR: the \fI\)Link Key\fR, and the
equivalent of the \fI\)Routing Context\fR: the \fI\)Interface Identifier\fR.
An Application Server may also represent multiple \fI\)Interface
Identifiers\fR.
.)d
.pp
An Application Server Process can be active and handling traffic for any
number or combination of traffic flows.  That is, the ASP can be actively
handling traffic for any number of Application Servers.
When an SCTP
.[
rfc2960
.]
association fails, it is necessary to identify both the sequence of the last
message succesfully received and processed by the Signalling Process, as well
as the traffic flow within which that sequence applies.
.pp
Therefore, this document identifies a message in a traffic flow by the
\fI\)Routing Context\fR, \fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR\) and the correlation
(sequence) number within that flow as identified by the \fI\)Correlation
Identifier\fR.  The \fI\)Correlation Identifier\fR is a combination of
\fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR and \fI\)Correlation Number\fR which is applied to all
divertable traffic.
.pp
(For details on the assignment of \fI\)Traffic Flow Identifiers\fR and Correlation
numbers, see Section 4.1.2 "Correlation".)
.sh 4 "SGP Starting New SGP-to-ASP Traffic"
.pp
When traffic is originally started for a traffic flow, the first divertable
message in the traffic flow is assigned a \fI\)Correlation Number\fR of one (1) by the
sending Signalling Process.  Subsequent divertable messages within the routing
context are given the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR number of two (2), three (3), and so on.
.pp
Because SCTP is a sequenced reliable transport,
.[
rfc2960
.]
it is only necessary to communicate this \fI\)Correlation Id\fR number between SPP
peers for the intial message which is sent to the peer.  Each Signalling
Peer Process \fB\)MUST\fR be capable of counting the messages which have been
sent or received on the SCTP association, and assigning each subsequent
message the next sequential \fI\)Correlation Id\fR number.
.sh 4 "SPP Diverting peer SPP Traffic"
.pp
Should, for example,  the association fail between the SGP and the ASP, the
SGP will recover any buffers from categories (1), (2), (3) and (4), and
immediately restart traffic, in sequence, on another active ASP within the AS.
When the SGP restarts traffic on this alternate ASP, if the messages belong to
Category (4) or (3) (i.e, they were transmitted on but not acknowledged by the
underlying transport, or transmitted and acknowledged), the SGP will label the
initial message sent with the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR of the message at the time that
it was originally sent.  When the SGP sends tmessages from Category (2), (1)
and newly arriving traffic, the SGP will not tag the messages with a
\fI\)Correlation Id\fR, but instead will label them internally with the next
sequential \fI\)Correlation Numbers\fR for the traffic flow.
.pp
Thus, the alternate Signalling Peer Process which is receiving diverted
traffic will be able to distinguish the problematic Category (3) and (4)
messages from those which follow.  When an tagged message is received, the
Signalling Peer Process is now aware that the messages were previously sent to
the normal SPP to which the SCTP association was lost.  When an untagged
message arrives, the receiving Signalling Peer Process is aware that this and
subsequent messages within the traffic flow represent previously unsent
traffic.
.pp
(Detailed procedures for the tagging of messages are described in Section
4.1.3 and 4.1.5.2.1; for diversion, Sections 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.1.6.)
.sh 4 "SPP Receiving Diverted Traffic"
.pp
At the Signalling Process receiving the diverted traffic for the \fI\)Routing
Context\fR, three actions are possible (or, combinations of the three):
.np 1
Ignore the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR and process the messages blind at the risk
that message duplication will occur,
.np
discard all messages tagged with a \fI\)Correlation Id\fR at the risk of increased
message loss, or,
.np
perform the procedures described in Section 4.1.5.2.2 minimizing the message
duplication and loss resulting from the diversion.
.pp
Only by performing the procedures described in Section 4.1.5.2.2 will message
duplication and loss be minimized.
.sh 4 "SPP Restoring Traffic"
.pp
Should, for example, the association recover between the SGP and ASP, the ASP
will need to rebalance the load across the available SGPs and the newly
available SGP.  As discussed, if the ASP switches traffic immediately, message
mis-sequencing can occur.  Two procedures are provided by \fI\)CORID\fR for
restoring traffic without message mis-sequencing: a Heartbeat procedure and a
timer procedure.
.pp
The Heartbeat procedure withholds divertable traffic from the SGP currently
active for each traffic flow and sends a \fI\)BEAT\fR message on each flow.
Once the \fI\)BEAT ACK\fR is received by the ASP, the ASP is assured that
there is no divertable traffic pending on the SGP and the traffic flow can be
switched to the recovered SGP.  The Heartbeat procedure is applicable to
recovery between SGPs in the same SG as well as SGPs in different SGs.
.pp
The Timer procedure witholds divertable traffic from the SGP currently active
for the traffic flow and waits until a timer expires.  Once the timer expires,
the ASP is resonably assured that there is no traffic pending on the SGP and
the traffic flow can be switched to the recovered SGP.  The Timer procedure is
applicable to recovery between SGPs where the SGPs do not support
\fI\)CORID\fR.
.pp
Restoration of traffic is described in detail in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.1.6.

.sh 3 "Correlation"
.pp
Each independent traffic flow for a given Application Server as identified by
a \fI\)Routing Context\fR (\fI\)Interface Identifier\fR) \fB\)MUST\fR be
correlated using a \fI\)Correlation Id\fR.  The \fI\)Correlation Id\fR
consists of a \fI\)Correlation Number\fR and a traffic flow identifier.  The
\fI\)Correlation Number\fR is used to number each message within the given traffic
flow.
.sh 4 "Assignment of Correlation Ids"
.pp
To accomodate all combinations of traffic modes at AS and SG, divertable
messages are correlated by independent traffic flow.  That is, each sent
divertable message is labelled with a traffic flow identifier and a
\fI\)Correlation Number\fR for the AS that is incremented for each message sent for
the traffic flow.  In the same fashion, each received divertable message is
labelled with the identity of the traffic flow on which it was received and a
\fI\)Correlation Number\fR for the AS that is incremented for each message received on
that traffic flow.
.pp
An SPP maintains two correlation counters for each traffic flow for each AS:
for each traffic flow, one counter tracks the \fI\)Correlation Number\fR of messages
sent to the AS and the other tracks the \fI\)Correlation Number\fR of messages
received from the AS.  Before traffic is started for an AS on a traffic flow,
these counters are set to zero (0).  The first divertable message for the AS
on the flow \fB\)MUST\fR then be assigned a coorrelation number of one (1);
and subsequent divertable messages, the \fI\)Correlation Number\fR of two (2), three
(3), and so forth.
.pp
Whenever traffic is started for the AS (using the ASP Active Procedures), the
correlation counters \fB\)SHALL\fR be synchronized by exchanging correlation
numbers and traffic flow identifiers in the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter
in the \fI\)ASPAC\fR and \fI\)ASPAC ACK\fR messages.  For new traffic, the
\fI\)Correlation Number\fR \fB\)MUST\fR zero (0); for restarting traffic, it is
\fB\)SHOULD\fR be the \fI\)Correlation Number\fR of the last message transferred.
(See Section 4.2.3.)
.sh 4 "Assignment of Traffic Flow Ids"
.pp
\fI\)Traffic Flow Ids\fR \fB\)SHALL\fR identify a switchable traffic flow
within an Application Server.  The \fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR value \fB\)SHALL\fR
be assigned by the sending SPP\*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
That is, the \fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR will be assigned by the SPP
\fB\)sending\fR the message.  \fI\)Traffic Flow Ids\fR are only used to
determine whether messages belong to the same traffic flow, therefore, the
\fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR need only uniquely identify a traffic flow within an
Application Server at the sending SPP.
.)d
.pp
\fI\)Traffic Flow Ids\fR assigned by an SPP and \fB\)MUST\fR be communicated
to the peer SPP in an \fI\)ASPAC\fR or \fI\)ASPAC ACK\fR message.
.pp
For traffic distributions that do not loadshare (i.e, Override and Broadcast),
the \fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR field is not required and \fB\)MAY\fR be set to
zero (0).  In this case, the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter in the
\fI\)BEAT\fR, \fI\)BEAT ACK\fR, \fI\)ASPAC\fR or \fI\)ASPAC ACK\fR message
\fB\)SHOULD\fR only contain one \fI\)Correlation Id\fR field (see Section
3.1.1).
.pp
Following are rules for the assignment of \fI\)Traffic
Flow Ids\fR at an SPP:
.np
If an SPP belongs to a regular Override or Broadcast AS, no \fI\)Traffic Flow
Id\fR need be assigned or included by the SPP in the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR
parameter.
.np
If an SPP belongs to a regular Loadshare AS, a \fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR is
assigned and included in the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter.  The
\fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR Id assigned \fB\)MUST\fR unambiguously identify the
traffic flow within the AS.
.np
If an SPP belongs to a Load Selector,
.[
loadsel05
.]
a \fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR is assigned and included in the \fI\)Correlation
Id\fR parameter regardless of the \fI\)Traffic Mode Type\fR of the AS.  The
\fI\)Traffic Flow Id\fR assigned \fB\)MUST\fR unambiguously identify the the
Load Selection within the AS.\*#

.sh 3 "Tagging"
.pp
Each sent or received message for an AS is labelled when it is first sent or
received.  The message is labelled with the traffic flow id associated with
the SPP to or from which the message was sent or received, and the correlation
number assigned within the traffic flow (see Section 4.1.2.1).
.pp
Tagged messages contain a \fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter: an untagged
message is tagged by adding a \fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter to the message.
When a message is tagged, it \fB\)SHALL\fR be tagged with the same values of
the traffic flow id (if required) and \fI\)Correlation Number\fR with which it was
originally labelled.
.pp
Although each message is labelled with a traffic flow id and correlation
number, the message is not necessarily tagged with the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR
parameter when the message is sent.  Messages for an AS that are sent for the
first time \fB\)MUST NOT\fR be tagged.  Messages retransmitted \fB\)MUST\fR be
tagged.
.sh 3 "Buffering"
.pp
To support \fI\)CORID\fR and SPP will have to, under some circumstances,
buffer messages.  When divering traffic, the SPP requires buffers to hold
unsent messages awaiting diversion; when sending traffic, the SPP requires
buffers to hold local copies of sent messages in the event of failure.
.sh 4 "SPP witholding unsent messages"
.pp
\fI\)CORID\fR procedures require that an SPP at times withhold AS traffic.  To
perform this, the SPP allocates a diversion buffer and places in the buffer
all subsequent messages that would otherwise be sent to the SPP for the AS.
.sh 4 "Local copies of sent messages"
.pp
To reduce loss of messages, an SPP \fB\)SHOULD\fR buffer messages until it can
be assured that the peer SPP has received and processed the message.  When a
message is sent to an SPP supporting \fI\)CORID\fR a local copy of the message
\fB\)MUST\fR be kept until it is discarded in accordance with a \fI\)CORID\fR
procedure.\*#
.(d
.#v
.ip \*#
\fB\)IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:\-\fR  A simple way to meet the requirements for
keeping local copies of messages is to keep a local copy of all messages sent
to an SPP supporting \fI\)CORID\fR until a fixed buffer allocation is
exceeded, or until the local copy lifetime expires.  T(lifetime) and buffer
capacity can then be adjusted to ensure that local copies of messages are not
discarded too early resulting in message loss during fail-over.
.)d
.np
A local copy \fB\)SHOULD NOT\fR be discarded when it is acknowledged by the
peer SCTP.
.np
a local copy \fB\)SHOULD NOT\fR be discarded until the sending SPP is
confident that the peer SPP has received and processed the message.
.np
To ensure that stale messages do not propagate through the system, an SPP
\fB\)SHOULD NOT\fR keep local copies of sent messages for longer than a
maximum lifetime T(lifetime).  Any local coppies of sent messages that are older
(measured from the moment at which they were sent to the peer SPP) than
T(lifetime) \fB\)SHOULD\fR be discarded.
.sh 3 "Message Handling"
.pp
The SPP supporting \fI\)CORID\fR handles tagged and untagged messages
differently.
.sh 4 "Untagged Messages"
.pp
Under some circumstances, an SPP will send or receive untagged messages.
Untagged messages (see Section 4.1.3) are messages which do not contain a
\fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter.
.sh 5 "SPP sending untagged messages"
.pp
An SPP sends untagged messages to a peer SPP whenever the message is being
sent for an Application Server for the first time.  All divertable messages
which have been transmitted for the first time \fB\)MUST NOT\fR be sent
tagged.
.pp
Local copies of untagged messages awaiting acknowledgement or expiry are
labelled with the \fI\)Routing Context\fR (\fI\)Interface Identifier\fR) for
the Application Server to which they were sent, the traffic flow id of the SPP
to which they were sent, and the \fI\)Correlation Number\fR of the message.  The
\fI\)Correlation Number\fR with which a message is labelled \fB\)MUST\fR be the next
sequential \fI\)Correlation Number\fR for the AS and traffic flow.  These labels can
be used later to tag a message that is marked for diversion.
.sh 5 "SPP receiving untagged messages"
.pp
When an SPP receives an untagged message, it associates with the message the
next sequential \fI\)Correlation Number\fR for the \fI\)Routing Context\fR
(\fI\)Interface Identifier\fR) and traffic flow id for which the message was
received.  Untagged messages are received in order and \fB\)MAY\fR be
processed when received.  The SPP \fB\)SHOULD\fR keep track of the
\fI\)Correlation Id\fRs that have been processed for the AS.
.sh 4 "Tagged Messages"
.pp
Under some circumstances, an SPP will send or receive tagged messages.
Tagged messages (see Section 4.1.3) are messages which contain a
\fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter.
.sh 5 "SPP sending tagged messages"
.pp
An SPP sends tagged traffic whenever it sends traffic that is marked for
diversion.  That is, whenever an SPP sends divertable messages to an SPP other
than the original SPP for which those messages were labelled, the SPP
\fB\)MUST\fR tag the message with the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter that
contains the labelled traffic flow id (if required) and \fI\)Correlation
Number\fR.
.pp
In addition, when a ASP becomes active for a Broadcast AS, an SGP \fB\)MUST\fR
tag the first message in each traffic flow towards the ASP to allow the ASP to
synchronize its entry into the Broadcast AS.
.sh 5 "SPP receiving tagged messages"

.sh 4 "Heartbeat Messages"

Under some circumstances, an SPP will send or receive \fI\)BEAT\fR messages
with the intention of pushing the messages on the stream on which the
\fI\)BEAT\fR message is sent.
.sh 5 "SPP sending BEAT messages"
.pp
An SPP sends \fI\)BEAT\fR messages whenever it witholds traffic to or from an
AS in preparation for diversion.  That is, whenever an SPP withholds
divertable messages, the SPP \fB\)MUST\fR send a \fI\)BEAT\fR message with an
implied Application Server or explicit \fI\)Routing Context\fR (\fI\)Interface
Identifier\fR) plus the \fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter with the \fI\)Traffic
Flow Ids\fR for a particularl stream, on each stream used by the AS for which
traffic is being diverted.
.sh 5 "SPP receiving BEAT messages"
.pp
The handling of \fI\)BEAT\fR messages is the mechanism that provide for the
reduction of message loss, duplication and mis-sequencing during diversion
between active SPP.  An SPP receiving a \fI\)BEAT\fR message containing an
explicit or implied \fI\)Routing Context\fR (\fI\)Interface Identifier\fR) and
\fI\)Correlation Id\fR parameter on a stream other than stream zero (0)
\fB\)SHALL\fR perform the following actions:
.np
The SPP will wait until any internal queue of messages for the Application

.np
Once internal message queues for the Application server have drained (i.e. all
messages for the indicated Application Server have been processed), and any
changeback procedure to the SS7 network has completed at an SGP, the SPP will
respond with a \fI\)BEAT ACK\fR message which contains the \fI\)Routing
Context\fR\) (\fI\)Interface Identifier\fR) parameter, the \fI\)Correlation
Id\fR parameter unchanged, and the opqaue information contained in the
\fI\)Heatbeat Data\fR parameter of the \fI\)BEAT\fR message.  (This \fI\)BEAT
ACK\fR message may be sent on any stream.)
.sh 3 "Diversion"

When an SPP supporting \fI\)CORID\fR wishes to reroute traffic from one SPP or
AS to another, it performs a diversion.
.sh 4 "SPP diverting traffic from a failed, deactivated or overridden peer SPP"

When diverting traffic due to a failed, deactivated or overridden peer SPP,
the diverting SPP will be in one of the following situations:
.np
no alternate SPP exists,
.np
an alternate SPP exists in the same AS or SG,
.np
an alternate SPP exists in a different AS or SG.
.sh 5 "Alternate SPP in same AS or SG, or No Alternate SPP"
.pp
When an SPP diverts AS traffic away from a failed, deactivated or overridden
peer SPP to an alternate peer SPP in the same AS or SG, the SPP \fB\)SHALL\fR
perform the following actions:
.np
The SPP tags (see Section 4.1.3) each untagged message that is marked for
diversion.
.np
If an alternate SPP is available (active for the AS), the SPP sends the
messages marked for divertion to the alternate SPP.
.np
If no alternate SPP exists (the AS is AS-PENDING), the SPP buffers the marked
messages in a buffer used for buffering messages while the AS is in the
AS-PENDING state.
.np
The SPP then diverts AS traffic, beginning with traffic withheld for the AS,
to the alternate SPP or AS-PENDING buffer.

This procedure corresponds to the Sequenced Changeover procedure used by the
SS7 MTP.

If the SPP receives the \fI\)BEAT ACK\fR message(s) for the concerned
Application Server that contain the unique identifier(s) in the
