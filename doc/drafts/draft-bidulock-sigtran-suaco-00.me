This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with all

groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as
Internet-Drafts.
.lp
Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may
be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time.  It is
inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them
other than as 'work in progress'.

.uh "Abstract"
.lp
This Internet-Draft describes parameters and procedures in extension to
the SS7 SCCP User Adaptiation Layer
.[
sua09
.]
that permits seamless Connection-Oriented operation with Network Service
Users not possible in the existing protocol.
.sh 1 "Introduction"
.lp
SCCP,
.[
q711
.]
and the OSI Network Services Definition
.[
x213
.]
upon which SCCP is based,
provides primitives at the SCCP to SCCP-User boundary.  Although SUA
.[
sua09
.]
claims seamless operation with SCCP and SCCP-Users, SUA does not provide the
following:
.bu
Mapping of the Connection-Oriented SCCP/SCCP-User primitive interface to SUA messages.
.bu
Procedures for local management (binding, listening and accepting) of SCCP connections.
.bu
Procedures for operation in multiple SG as STP configurations.
.bu
Procedures for operation without coupling at the SG.
.bu
Procedures for GTT support at the ASP/IPSP.
.lp
This document provides for these capabilities allowing seamless interworking
between the SS7 and IP networks with SUA-CO.

.sh 2 "Scope"
.sh 2 "Terminology"
.lp
The terminology of SUA
.[
sua09
.]
also applies in this document.  This document provides additional terminology
as follows:
.sh 2 "Overview"
.sh 2 "Functional Areas"
.sh 3 "Definition of the SCCP-User Boundary"
.sh 4 "Mapping of SCCP Primitives"
