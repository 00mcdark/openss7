.uh "Abstract"
.pp
This memo describes \fI\)Session Id Registration (SESSID)\fR that
provides the ability for one (listening) Application Server to indicate that a
session should be established with another (accepting) Application Server for
connection- and transaction-oriented messaging in the SS7 Signalling User
Adaptation Layers.

Extension parameters and procedures are added by this memo in extension to
those of the User Adaptation layers to provide a closer model to that of the
XNS/XTI interfaces, where one interface may be designated as a `listener' and
another designated as an `acceptor'.  This permits ISO compliant interfaces
for SCCP to maintain the same semantic for SUA and TUA.
