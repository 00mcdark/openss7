@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
@cpindex STREAMS


This document specifies a @cite{STREAMS}-based
@cpindex STREAMS
kernel-level instantiation of the ITU-T @value{MANUAL_TITLE} definition.  The @value{MANUAL_TITLE}
enables the user of a a signalling data terminal service to access and use any of a variety of
conforming signalling data terminal providers without specific knowledge of the provider's protocol.
The service interface is designed to support any network signalling data terminal protocol and user
signalling data terminal protocol.  This interface only specifies access to signalling data terminal
service providers, and does not address issues concerning signalling data terminal management,
protocol performance, and performance analysis tools.

This specification assumes that the reader is familiar with ITU-T state machines and signalling data
terminal interfaces (e.g.  Q.703, Q.2210), and @cite{STREAMS}.

@node The Signalling Data Terminal Layer
@chapter The Signalling Data Terminal Layer

@menu
* Model of the SDTI::
* SDTI Services::
* Purpose of the SDTI::
@end menu

The Signalling Data Terminal Layer provides the means to manage the association of SDT-Users into
connections.  It is responsible for the routing and management of data to and from signalling data
terminal connections between SDT-user entities.

@node Model of the SDTI
@section Model of the SDTI
@cpindex STREAMS

The SDTI defines the services provided by the signalling data terminal layer to the signalling data
terminal user at the boundary between the signalling data terminal provider and the signalling data
terminal user entity.  The interface consists of a set of primitives defined as @cite{STREAMS}
messages that provide access to the signalling data terminal layer services, and are transferred
between the SDTS user entity and the SDTS provider.  These primitives are of two types; ones that
originate from the SDTS user, and other that originate from the SDTS provider.  The primitives that
originate from the SDTS user make requests to the SDTS provider, or respond to an indication of an
event of the SDTS provider.  The primitives that originate from the SDTS provider are either
confirmations of a request or are indications to the CCS user that an event has occurred.
@figref{1} shows the model of the SDTI.

@figuresized{sdti01,1,Model of the SDTI,3.0in}

The SDTI allows the SDTS provider to be configured with any signalling data terminal layer user (such as
a signalling link application) that also conforms to the SDTI.  A signalling data terminal layer
user can also be a user program that conforms to the SDTI and accesses the SDTS provider via
@command{@b{putmsg}(2s)} and @command{@b{getmsg}(2s)} system calls.  The typical configuration,
however, is to place a signalling link module above the signalling data terminal layer.

@node SDTI Services
@section SDTI Services

The features of the SDTI are defined in terms of the services provided by the SDTS provider, and the
individual primitives that may flow between the SDTS user and the SDTS provider.

The SDTI Services are broken into two groups: local management services and protocol services.
Local management services are responsible for the local management of streams, assignment of streams
to physical points of attachment, enabling and disabling of streams, management of options
associated with a stream, and general acknowledgement and event reporting for the stream.  Protocol
services consist of connecting a stream to a medium, exchanging data with the medium, and
disconnecting the stream from the medium.

@subsection Local Management

Local management services are listed in @tabref{1}.

@tabfig{lmit01,1,Local Management Services}

The local management services interface is described in @ref{Local Management Services}, and the
primitives are detailed in @ref{Local Management Service Primitives}.  The local management services
interface is defined by the @file{ss7/lmi.h} header file (@pxref{LMI Header File Listing}).

@subsection Protocol

Protocol services are listed in @tabref{2}.

@tabfig{sdtit02,2,Protocol Services}

The protocol services interface is described in @ref{Protocol Services}, and the primitives are
detailed in @ref{Protocol Service Primitives}.  The protocol services interface is defined by the
@file{ss7/sdti.h} header file (@pxref{SDTI Header File Listing}).

The SDTI is typically implemented as a device driver controlling a MPCC (Multi-Protocol Controller Chip)
device that provides access to channels.  The purpose behind exposing this low level interface is
that almost all communications channel devices can be placed into a SS7 HDLC mode, where a data
stream can be exchanged between the driver and the medium.  The SDTI provides and inteface that, once
implemented as a driver for a new device, can provide complete and verified SS7 signalling link
capabilities by pushing generic SL (Signalling Link) modules over
an open device stream.

This allows SL modules to be verified independently for correct operation and then simply
used for all manner of new device drivers that can implement the SDTI interface.

@node Physical Point of Attachment Service
@subsection Physical Point of Attachment Service

The local management interface provides the LMS user with the ability to associate a stream to a
physical point of appearance (@dfn{PPA}) or to disassociate a stream from a PPA.  The local
management interface provides for two styles of LMS provider:

@subsubheading Style 1 LMS Provider

A @dfn{Style 1} LMS provider is a provider that associates a stream with a PPA at the time of the
first @manref{open(2)} call for the device, and disassociates a stream from a PPA at the time of the
last @manref{close(2)} call for the device.

Physical points of attachment (PPA) are assigned to major and minor device number combinations.
When the major and minor device number combination is opened, the opened stream is automatically
associated with the PPA for the major and minor device number combination.  The last close of the
device disassociates the PPA from the stream.

Freshly opened @dfn{Style 1} LMS provider streams start life in the @psta{LMI_DISABLED} state.

This approach is suitable for LMS providers implemented as real or pseudo-device drivers and is
applicable when the number of minor devices is small and static.

@subsubheading Style 2 LMS Provider

A @dfn{Style 2} LMS provider is a provider that associates a stream with a PPA at the time that the
LMS user issues the @prim{LMI_ATTACH_REQ} message.  Freshly opened streams are not associated with
any PPA.  The @dfn{Style 2} LMS provider stream is disassociated from a PPA when the stream is
closed or when the LMS user issues the @prim{LMI_DETACH_REQ} message.

Freshly opened @dfn{Style 2} LMS provider streams start life in the @psta{LMI_UNATTACHED} state.

This approach is suitable for LMS providers implemented as clone real or pseudo-device drivers  and
is applicable when the number of minor devices is large or dynamic.

Initialization service primitives allow the LMS user to enable or disable the protocol service
interface.  Enabling the protocol service interface may require that some action be taken to prepare
the protocol service interface for use or to remove it from use.  For example, where the PPA
corresponds to a signalling data link identifier as defined in Q.704, it may be necessary to perform
switching to connect or disconnect the circuit identification code associated with the signalling
data link identifier.

These service primitives implement the initialization service (@pxref{Initialization Service}).

@node Data Transfer Service Primitives
@subsection Data Transfer Service Primitives

The data transfer service primitives provide the means for transfering data between SDTS users
across a signalling data link.  Data is sent and received in signal units.  Signal units are the
data contained in frames that occur between flags on the line excluding the checksum octets.  These
are packets of data that contain an integer number of octets (a multiple of 8 bits).  When
performing data transfer, signal units that are correctly received on the signalling data link are
delivered to the SDTS user as they arrive.  Signal units for transmission are delivered to the SDTS
provider on demand, however, during quiescent periods it is sometimes advantageous from the point of
view of synchronous driver design to request trasnmission of additional signal units in a @dfn{pull}
arrangement rather than a @dfn{push} arrangement.  Therefore there is a primitive to allow the SDTS
provider to  request additional data for trasnsmission.

These service primitives implement the data transfer service (@pxref{Data Transfer Service}).

@subsubsection SDT_DAEDT_TRANSMISSION_REQ

@subsubheading Description

The DAEDT transmission request service primitive is originated by the SDTS user to request that the
SDTS provider trasnmit a signal unit on the medium.  A signal unit is a self-contained packet of
data containing an integer number of octets of information.  This primitive is a request from the
Transmission Control (TXC) function in the SDTS user to the DAEDT function in the SDTS provider.

@subsubheading Format
@tpindex sdt_daedt_transmission_req_t

The DAEDT transmission request service primitive consists of zero or one @msg{M_PROTO} message
block, followed by one or more @msg{M_DATA} message blocks containing the signal unit to transmit.
The @msg{M_PROTO} mesage block, when present, is structured as follows:

@display
@verbatim
typedef struct {
    sdt_long sdt_primitive;
} sdt_daedt_transmission_req_t;
@end verbatim
@end display

@subsubheading Parameters

The DAEDT transmission request service primitive contains the following parameters:

@table @parm

@item sdt_primitive
Specifies the service primitive type.  Always @prim{SDT_DAEDT_TRANSMISSION_REQ}.

@end table

@subsubheading State

This primitive is only valid in the @psta{LMI_ENABLED} management state with the DAEDT in the
@psta{IN-SERVICE} state.

@subsubheading New State

The new state is unchanged.

@subsubheading Rules

The SDTS user must observe the following rules when issuing the DAEDT transmission request service
primitive:

@itemize ---

@item
This primitive should only be issued by the SDTS provider after the transmitters have been enabled
with a @prim{SDT_DAEDT_START_REQ} and the DAEDT is in the @psta{IN-SERVICE} state.

@item
After the transmitter have been enabled while in the @psta{LMI_ENABLED} management state, the
DAEDT state is always appropriate for the SDTS user to issue this primitive.

@item
The @msg{M_PROTO} message block is optional.  The SDTS provider will be prepared to accept
@msg{M_DATA} message blocks from the SDTS user, without any @msg{M_PROTO} message block, as service
primitive of this type.

@item
Most narrowband SS7 SDTS providers peform what is known as SU repetition.  When SUs that correspond
to FISUs (Fill-In Signal Units) or LSSUs (Link Status Signal Units) which are sent continuously on
the signalling link, the SDTS user need only send the first such signal unit.  The SDTS provider
will continuously repeat a FISU or LSSU, when appropriate,@footnote{Note that the only LSSU that is
not repeated continuously is the SIB.} until the next signal unit is presented for transmission.  To
perform this function, a narrowband SS7 SDTS provider must know the protocol options associated with
the signalling link (i.e. the size of the sequence numbers and length indicator).

Activate or deactivation of @dfn{SU Repeating} is a provider-specific function.

@end itemize

@subsubheading Response

This primitive does not require receipt acknowledgement.

@itemize @minus

@item @b{Successful:}
When successful, the primitive does not require receipt acknowledgement.  The link state is
unchanged.

@item @b{Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):}
When unsuccessful, the SDTS provider negatively acknowledges the primitive using a
@prim{LMI_ERROR_ACK} primitive containing the error and reason for failure.  The state remains
unchanged.

@end itemize

When the terminal is in the @psta{LMI_ENABLED} management state, but the DAEDT is still in the
@psta{IDLE} state, the primitive should be ignored and the corresponding data discarded without
generating a non-fatal error.

@subsubsection SDT_RC_SIGNAL_UNIT_IND

@subsubheading Description

The RC signal unit indication service primitive is issued by the SDTS provider when a signal unit
arrives on the signalling data link and passes error detection.  The primitive is named the
@samp{RC} signal unit indication because this signal is normally sent to reception control (RC)
within the SS7 Level 2 state machine.  This primitive is an indication from the DAEDR function in
the SDTS provider to the Reception Control (RC) function in the SDTS user.

@subsubheading Format
@tpindex sdt_rc_signal_unit_ind_t

The RC signal unit indication service primtive consists of one optional @msg{M_PROTO} message block
followed by one or more @msg{M_DATA} message blocks containing the receive signal unit.  The
@msg{M_PROTO} message block, when present, is structured as follows:

@display
@verbatim
typedef struct {
    sdt_long sdt_primitive;
    sdt_ulong sdt_count;
} sdt_rc_signal_unit_ind_t;
@end verbatim
@end display

@subsubheading Parameters

The RC signal unit indication service primtive contains the following parameters:

@table @parm

@item sdt_primitive
Indicates the service primitive type.  Always @prim{SDT_RC_SIGNAL_UNIT_IND}.

@item sdt_count
When signal unit compression is in effect, this field contains a count of the number of compressed
identical signal units (not counting the original).  When signal unit compression is not in effect,
or the signal unit was not compressed (it was not repeated on the line), this field is set to the
value 0.

@end table

@subsubheading State

This primitive is only issued from the @psta{LMI_ENABLED} management state.

@subsubheading New State

The state remains unchanged.

@subsubheading Rules

The SDTS provider observes the following rules when generating the RC signal unit indication
primitive:

@itemize ---

@item
The primitive is only issued when the signalling data terminal is in the @psta{LMI_ENABLED}
management state.

@item
Received signal units are indicated only after the receivers have been enabled using the
@prim{SDT_DAEDR_START_REQ} command and the DAEDR is in the @psta{IN-SERVICE} state.

@item
Once the SDTS user is receiving signal units, it will continue to do so until a fatal error occurs,
the stream is closed, or the signalling data terminal is disabled with the
@prim{LMI_DISABLE_REQ} primitive.

@item
The @msg{M_PROTO} message block is optional and is only really required for indicating the count of
compressed signal units.  When signal unit compression is not in effect, or when a signal unit is
not compressed (i.e. has a @parm{sdt_count} of zero), the @msg{M_PROTO} message block is
unnecessary and SDTS providers are encouraged to not include it.  When the @msg{M_PROTO} message
block is not included, the signal unit is delivered simply as a chain of one or more @msg{M_DATA}
message blocks to the SDTS user.  The SDTS user must be prepared to receive RC signal unit
indications consisting of only @msg{M_DATA} message blocks.

@item
Most narrowband SS7 SDTS providers provider for signal unit compression.  Under this scheme, the
first non-identical signal unit is indicated with a @parm{sdt_count} of zero.  Should additional
identical signal units be received, the will be counted until another non-identical signal unit is
received.  At that point, an RC signal unit indication with a @parm{sdt_count} indicating the
number of compressed signal units is indicated followed by an indication of the new non-identical
signal unit with a @parm{sdt_count} of zero.  And the cycle repeats.

To support this feature, SDTS users must be prepared to accept a compressed frame representing all
of the contiguous identical signalling units in this fashion.  For example, the SDTS user cannot
rely by its design on the third identical signal unit causing a state transsition in a timely

@subsubsection SDT_TXC_TRANSMISSION_REQUEST_IND

@subsubheading Description

The TXC transmission request indication service primitive is originated by the SDTS provider to
indicate that if a signal unit is not available for transmission that the signalling terminal will
idle the signalling data link.  Depending on the specific SDTS provider, idling the signalling data
link may consist of idling continuous flags, FISUs or LSSUs.  This indication provides timing ques
to the SDTS user.  This primitive is an indication from the DAEDT function in the SDTS provider to
the Transmission Control (TXC) function in the SDTS user.

@subsubheading Format
@tpindex sdt_txc_transmission_request_ind_t

The TXC transmission request indication service primitive consists of one @msg{M_PROTO} message
block, structured as follows:

@display
@verbatim
typedef struct {
    sdt_long sdt_primitive;
} sdt_txc_transmission_request_ind_t;
@end verbatim
@end display

@subsubheading Parameters

The TXC transmission request indication service primitive contains the following parameters:

@table @parm

@item sdt_primitive
Indicates the service primitive type.  Always @prim{SDT_TXC_TRANSMISSION_REQUEST_IND}.

@end table

@subsubheading State

This primitive is only issued from the @psta{LMI_ENABLED} management state and when the DAEDT is
in the @psta{IN-SERVICE} state.

@subsubheading New State

The new state is unchanged.

@subsubheading Rules

The SDTS provider observes the following rules when issuing the TXC transmission request indication
service primitive:

@itemize ---

@item
This service primitive is only issued when the signalling terminal is in the @psta{LMI_ENABLED}
management state.

@item
This service primitive is only issued when the DAEDT is in the @psta{IN-SERVICE} state; that is, a
@prim{SDT_DAEDT_START_REQ} primitive has been received by the SDTS provider for the signalling
terminal.

@item
This service primitive is only issued by the SDTS provider when its transmission queue is empty.

@item
This service primitive is only issued by the SDTS provider when the provider is configured to
generate these indications.  Configuration of the SDTS provider is a provider-specific matter.

@end itemize


@subsubheading Response

This primitive does not require a specific response from the SDTS user.  Upon receiving this
primitive, if the SDTS user does not wish the signalling data link to idle flags, FISUs or LSSUs, it
should generate another trasnmission request using the @prim{SDT_DAEDT_TRANSMISSION_REQ}
primitive.

@page
@node Initial Alignment Service Primitives
@subsection Initial Alignment Service Primitives

The initial alignment service primitives peform the functions of the Alignment Error Rate Monitor
(AERM).  They provide the SDTS user with the ability to start and stop the AERM, set normal or
emergency proving periods, and receive correct signal unit indications and indications that the
error rate has exceeded the threshold.

Not all SDTS providers implement nor require an AERM function.  For example, broadband signalling
links can be configured to not perform proving, in which case the AERM function is not necessary.
Regardless of whether the AERM function is necessary or not, each SDTS provider should be prepared
to handle requests and generate appropriate indications as though an AERM function existed, and
without generating non-fatal errors.

Note that some designs do no permit the AERM function and the SUERM or EIM function to be active
simultaneously.

These service primitives implement the initial alignment service (@pxref{Initial Alignment
Service}).

@node Diagnostics Requirements
@chapter Diagnostics Requirements

Two error handling facilities should be provided to the SDTS user: one to handle non-fatal errors,
and the other to handle fatal errors.

@section Non-Fatal Error Handling Facility

These are errors that do not change the state of the SDTS interface as seen by the SDTS user and
provide the user with the option of reissuing the SDT primitive with the corrected options
specification.  The non-fatal error handling is provided only to those primitives that require
acknowledgements, and uses the @prim{LMI_ERROR_ACK} to report these errors.  These errors retain the
state of the SDTS interface the same as it was before the SDT provider received the primitive that
was in error.  Syntax errors and rule violations are reported via the non-fatal error handling
facility.

@section Fatal Error Handling Facility

These errors are issued by the SDT provider when it detects errors that are not correctable by the
SDT user, or if it is unable to report a correctible error to the SDTS user.  Fatal errors are
indicated via the STREAMS message type @code{M_ERROR} with the UNIX system error @code{EPROTO}.  The
@code{M_ERROR} STREAMS message type will result in the failure of all the UNIX system calls on the
stream.  The SDTS user can recover from a fatal error by having all the processes close the files
associated with the stream, and then reopening them for processing.

@table @emph

@item Signalling Data Terminal Service Data Unit

A grouping of SDT user data whose boundaries are preserved from one end of the signalling data terminal
connection to the other.

@item Data transfer

The phase in connection and connectionless modes that supports the transfer of data between to
signalling data terminal users.

@item SDT provider

The signalling data terminal layer protocol that provides the services of the signalling data terminal
interface.

@item SDT user

The user-level application or user-level or kernel-level protocol that accesses the services of the
signalling data terminal layer.

@item Local management

The phase in connection and connectionless modes in which a SDT user initializes a stream and
attaches a PPA address to the stream.  Primitives in this phase generate local operations only.

@item PPA

The point at which a system attaches itself to a physical communications medium.

@item PPA identifier

An identifier of a particular physical medium over which communication transpires.
