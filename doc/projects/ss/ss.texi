@node Executive Overview
@unnumbered Executive Overview

This document provides a @value{MANUAL_TYPE} for the @value{MANUAL_TITLE}.  The initial and primary
purposes of this equipment is to provide a scalable, carrier-grade platform for providing New
Generation Voice services for the PSTN and VoIP networks.  The purpose is both one of providing
traditional PSTN switching capabilities as well as providing VoIP interfaces for new generation
customers.

@subsubheading The OpenSS7 Project

The @uref{http://www.openss7.org/, OpenSS7 Project} is an open source software project that has
developed many protocol components within the SS7, SIGTRAN, ISDN and VoIP protocol stacks.
Intellectual property rights for the OpenSS7 Project are held by @uref{http://www.openss7.com/,
OpenSS7 Corporation}.  All OpenSS7 Project software is eventually licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
License Version 3.  OpenSS7 Corporation also provide commercial licensing of OpenSS7 Project
software under terms less restrictive than the AGPL.

@subsubheading The OpenSS7 SoftSwitch Complex

OpenSS7 can provide SoftSwitch COmplex capabilities in a collection of high-performance, low-cost,
small-footprint platforms leveraging the GNU/Linux operating system distributions and tools, and
utilizing low-cost commodity, or high-quality standardized hardware.

For details on platform applications, see @ref{Application Architecture}, @ref{Network
Architecture}, @ref{Optional Application Support}, and @ref{Optional Network Support}.

@subsubheading Open Source Software

The OpenSS7 Project leverages the widespread use of GNU/Linux operation systems, distributions, and
FSF tools such as @samp{autoconf} and @dfn{RPM}.  For example, this document was formatted for PDF,
HTML, info and plain text using the GNU @dfn{texinfo} system, @samp{autoconf}, and the @TeX{}
formatting system.

The open source model avoids proprietary lock-in and permits in-house or outsourced development.
All source code is available for use and modification by the end customer.  All build tools,
documentation and associated resources are generally available.  The availability of the source code
and complete documentation eases problem resolution and can offer upgrades and fixes even in advance
of client problem reports.  

For details on software solutions, see @ref{Protocol Architecture}, @ref{Software Architecture},
@ref{Optional Protocol Support}, and @ref{Optional Software Support}.

@subsubheading Commodity Hardware

By best utilizing commodity PC, hardenned server, or standardized CompactPCI hardware, OpenSS7 makes
available the highest performance platforms available on the market at back-to-school prices.  When
carrier-grade and large scale is not essential, 3GHz Pentium class servers in hardened rack mount
chassis can be used at a fraction of the cost, and yet outperform, other solutions.  Where
carrier-grade is necessary, embedded Linux on standardized PICMG 2.16 NEBS compliant chassis make
for a higher cost, but more reliable alternative.

For details on hardware solutions, see @ref{Platform Architecture}, @ref{Hardware Architecture} and
@ref{Optional Hardware Support}.

@subsubheading Operations Support

Operational support is provided using the most widespread operational support protocols (SNMP, CMOT,
TMN) available today.  All systems can be managed, monitored and adminstrated using management
protocols.  Because OpenSS7 components were engineered with management in mind, no mediation devices
are necessary and fully native element management system agents are provided.  By leveraging open
source network management system tools such as OpenNMS, and the provided SNMP applications, complete
management solutions are easy to adopt and integrate with existing systems.

For details on operational support, see @ref{Operations Support Architecture} and @ref{Optional
Operations Support Architecture}.

@subsubheading Rapid Development

The OpenSS7 Project has already developed protocol components completing the SS7 and SIGTRAN
signalling stacks, including MTP Level 2 and Level 3, ISUP, SCCP, TCAP; and SCTP, M2PA, M2UA, M3UA,
SUA and TUA.  Development of a carrier-grade Softswitch Complex to meed initial deployment
requirements needs on the development of some intermediate and auxillary modules.

For details on scheduling, see @ref{Logistics}.

@subsubheading An Evolving Solution

The OpenSS7 Project is evolving to support more protocol stacks including ISDN and VoIP.  Support
for an ever expanding capabilty is demonstrated by the additional options available as described in
@ref{Optional Application Support}, @ref{Optional Network Support}, @ref{Optional Protocol Support},
@ref{Optional Operations Support}, @ref{Optional Software Support}, and @ref{Optional Hardware
Support}.

@subsubheading Conclusions

In summary, an OpenSS7 Softswitch Complex is an excellent application of the OpenSS7 SS7 and VoIP
stakcs and can be provided at an affodable price on short term time-lines, while offering an
evolution path for future deployment applications.
