From NPA-NXX(X) determine:

- local call or toll call
- local call or extended area service call
- national toll call or international toll call
- intralata toll call or interlata toll call
- calculate the distance of the call (rate-center to rate center)
- determine originating and terminating switch
- determine host switch if switch is a remote
- determine HNPA of swtich
- determine switches to which point codes belong (if possible, really mostly
  just for well known tandems)

1.  From this information determine trunk groups (groups of circuits with
    distinct routing, IC, OG, 2W)

2.  From this information determine the role of an attached switch: e.g. local
    tandem, intralata tandem, access tandem, equal access (FGB,C,D) tandem.

3.  Count calls to and from any given LATA (by carrier) to determine toll
    bypass.
