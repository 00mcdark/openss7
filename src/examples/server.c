/*
 * [1]   The t_open() call specifies a device special file name; for example,
 *       /dev/streams/xtiso/tcp+.  This file name provides the necessary
 *       abstraction for the TCP transport protocol over IP.  Unlike the
 *       socket interface, where you specify the address family (for example,
 *       AF_INET), this information is already represented in the choice of
 *       the device special file.  The /dev/streams/xtio/tcp+ file implies
 *       both TCP transport and IP.  See the Chapter 5 for information about
 *       STREAMS devices.
 *
 *       As mentioned in Section B.1.1, if the OSI transport were available
 *       you would use a device such as /dev/streams/xtiso/cots.
 *
 *       Contrast the t_open() call with the socket call in Section B.1.1.
 *
 * [2]   Selection of the address depends on the choice of transport protocol.
 *       Note that in the socket example, the address family was the name as
 *       used in the socket system call.  With XTI, the choice is not obvious
 *       and you must know the appropriate mapping from the transport protocol
 *       to sockaddr.  See Chapter 3 for more information.
 *
 * [3]   INADDR_ANY signifies any attached interface adapter on the system.
 *       All numbers must be converted to the network format using appropriate
 *       macros.  See the following reference pages for more information:
 *       htonl(3), htons(3), ntohl(3), ntohs(3).
 *
 * [4]   SERVER_PORT is defined in the <common.h> header file.  It has a data
 *       type of short integer which helps identify the server process from
 *       other application processes.  Numbers from 0 to 1024 are reserved.
 *
 * [5]   Specify the number of pending connections the server can queue while
 *       it processes the last request.
 *
 * [6]   Bind the server's address with the t_bind() call.  The combination of
 *       the address and port number uniquely identify it on the network.
 *       After the server process' address is bound, the server profcess is
 *       registered on the system and can be identified by the lower level
 *       kernel functions to which to direct any requests.
 *
 * [7]   Listen for connection requests with the t_listen() function.
 *
 * [8]   Create a new transprot endpoint with another call to t_open()
 *       function.
 *
 * [9]   Accept the connection request with the t_accept() function.
 *
 * [10]  Each incoming message packet is accepted and passed to the parse
 *       function, which tracks the information provided (such as the
 *       merchant's login ID, password, and customer's credit card number).
 *       This process is repeated until the parse function identifies a
 *       complete transaction and returns a response packet to be sent to the
 *       client program.
 *
 *       The client program can send information packets in any order (and in
 *       one or more packets), so the parse function is designated to remember
 *       state information sufficient to deal with this unstructured message
 *       stream.
 *
 *       Since the program uses a connection-oriented protocol for data
 *       transfer, this function uses t_snd() and t_rcv() to send and receive
 *       data, respecitvely.
 *
 * [11]  Receive data with the t_rcv() function.
 *
 * [12]  Send data with the t_snd() function.
 *
