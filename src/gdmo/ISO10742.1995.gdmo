commonCreationDeletion-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		Managed object class imports the Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2 objectCreation 
		and/or objectDeletion notifications. Used as follows:

		objectCreation - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		created. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification. If creation occurred as a result of internal operation of the 
		resource, the value 'resourceOperation' is used. If creation occurred in 
		response to a management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A 
		value of 'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source 
		of the operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.

		objectDeletion - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		deleted. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification. If deletion occurred as a result of internal operation of the 
		resource, the value 'resourceOperation' is used. If deletion occurred in 
		response to a management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A 
		value of 'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source 
		of the operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.;


commonStateChange-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		Managed object class imports the Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2 stateChange 
		notification. Used to report the changes to the operationalState attribute, and 
		where present, the administrativeState attribute. A single parameter set is 
		included in the State change definition field. Only the (mandatory) attributeId 
		and (optional) newAttributeValue parameters are used.;

commonDeactivateConnection-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		Managed object class imports the Recommendation X.723 | ISO/IEC 10165 deactivate 
		action. The deactivate action causes the connection to be terminated. The 
		termination should occur as rapidly as practical, but no particular time 
		constraints are implied. Typically, this action simulates a disconnect request 
		received across the service interface. If a more rapid means for terminating the 
		connection exists, then this should be used. The termination shall occur in 
		conformance to the protocol standard.

		The Managed Object remains in existence after completion of the deactivate 
		action. It is subsequently deleted when the connection is terminated, in the 
		same way as if the connection had been terminated by other means. A deactivate 
		action may fail (with the ProcessingFailure response) if it is temporarily not 
		possible to terminate the connection.;


fRMRReceivedCommunicationsAlarm-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		Managed object imports the Recommendation X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2 
		communicationsAlarm notification. Used to report the following conditions:

		fRMRReceived - A FRMR frame is received. The received FRMR frame is reported as 
		additionalInformation in the notification, using the fRMR parameter. The 
		significance sub-parameter shall be set as described above.

		The probableCause parameter is set to the value communicationsProtocolError.

		The value DLM.fRMRReceived shall be reported in the specificProblems parameter. 
		In addition, the reason why the frame was sent is also returned in 
		specificProblems. Values are specified in the DLM ASN.1 module for 
		controlFieldUndefinedOrUnimplemented, infoFieldLengthGreaterThanMaximum, 
		invalidNR, formatError, and nonSpecific.

		The perceivedSeverity parameter is set to the value Minor. A subsequent 
		communicationsAlarm with a perceivedSeverity value of Cleared is not generated. 
		No other parameters are used.;


sLPConnection-sLPPM-Automatic-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The name binding which applies when an sLPConnection managed object (or an 
		instance of a subclass of the sLPConnection MO class) is created automatically 
		by the operation of the system as a subordinate object of an sLPPM managed 
		object (or subclass), and deleted automatically.

		The creation of an instance of an sLPConnection MO (or subclass) using this name 
		binding may reference an instance of the sLPConnectionIVMO (or subclass). The 
		means by which an instance (if any) of the sLPConnectionIVMO are identified are 
		a local matter. When this occurs, some of the initial values of the attributes 
		of the instance of the sLPConnection MO may be supplied by the values of the 
		attributes in the specified instance of sLPConnectionIVMO.

		However, any such value may be overridden by a value supplied by local means 
		(for example across an internal interface). Where values are supplied by the 
		IVMO, the initial value of an attribute of the sLPConnection MO shall be the 
		value of the corresponding attribute in the sLPConnectionIVMO (that is, which 
		has the same attribute template label). The naming attribute of the 
		sLPConnection MO is assigned a value according to local mechanisms.;


sLPConnection-sLPPM-Management-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS

-- Annex E
-- (informative)
-- Additional attributes and action required for systems
--
-- E.1 Introduction
--
-- In complete intermediate systems, such as a repeater, some attributes and actions are necessary to fill out the 
-- management of a complete system.  These items are generic in the sense that they are required for managed systems in 
-- general.  The following items are defined to aid in the completeness of this International Standard, although it is 
-- recognized that they are outside the bounds of the definition are for a layer 2 standard.
--
-- E.2 Scope
--
-- This annex defines additional attributes and an action that are necessary to the management of a complete 
-- intermediate system such as a repeater.  They are not specifically related to a Data Link Management Standard.
--
-- When a generic systems management standard is available with these definitions (or similar), it is expected that this 
-- portion of this International Standard will be removed.
