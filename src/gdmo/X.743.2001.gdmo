-- Annex B
-- The Network Time Protocol and Time Management Information
-- (This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard)
-- B.1 The Network Time Protocol
-- The Network Time Protocol may be implemented as the time synchronization service underlying this Time Management
-- Function. If so, it is implemented in accordance with RFC 1305 (see [5] in H.4). The NTP managed object class is
-- intended to be used with the Network Time Protocol time synchronization service.
-- B.2 The ntpProtocol managed object class definition
-- The ntpProtocol object provides access to the basic parameters of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) time
-- synchronization protocol. It is a subclass of the synchronization protocol managed object class. The basic parameters of
-- NTP include both the protocol to exchange time information and the procedures and algorithms used to process and act
-- on the time information gathered. The ntpProtocol object includes attributes to indicate:
--  the current state of the time synchronization protocol (polling intervals, modes of service, etc.) (specific to
-- particular subclass);
--  the offset, delay, maximum error (and other relevant data) associated with each clock with which time
-- information has been exchanged.
