commonCreationDeletion-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!Managed object class imports the X.721 | 10165-2 objectCreation and 
		objectDeletion notifications. Used as follows:

		ObjectCreation Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		created. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification. If creation occured as a result of internal operation of the 
		resource, the value 'resourceOperation' is used. If creation occured in response 
		to a management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A value of 
		'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source of the 
		operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.

		ObjectDeletion Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		deleted. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification. If deletion occured as a result of internal operation of the 
		resource, the value 'resourceOperation' is used. If deletion occured in response 
		to a management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A value of 
		'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source of the 
		operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.!;


commonStateChange-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!Managed object class imports the X.721 | 10165-2 stateChange notification. Used 
		to report the changes to the operationalState attribute, and where present, the 
		administrativeState attribute. A single parameter set is included in the State 
		change definition field. Only the (mandatory) attributeId and (optional) 
		newAttributeValue parameters are used.!;


octetsSentReceivedCounter-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!The octetsSentCounter and octetsReceivedCounter shall count only user data 
		octets in valid data TPDUs. They shall not count user data octets in data TPDUs 
		which are rejected for any reason, nor user data octets in nondata TPDUs.!;


successfulConnectionEstablishment-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!This Package imports the communicationsInformation notification from "GMI". It 
		is used to report the following events: successfulConnectionEstablishment: 
		Generated when a connection is successfully established. However the precise 
		synchronization between the notification and the corresponding protocol and 
		service interface interactions is not defined by this Recommendation | 
		International Standard. The value TLM.successfulConnectionEstablishment shall be 
		reported in the informationType field.!;


deactivateConnection-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!The deactivate action causes the connection to be terminated. The termination 
		should occur as rapidly as practical, but no particular time constraints are 
		implied. Typically, this action simulates a disconnect request received across 
		the service interface. If a more rapid means for terminating the connection 
		exists, then this should be used. The termination shall occur in conformance to 
		the protocol standard. The Managed Object remains in existence after completion 
		of the Deactivate Action. It is subsequently deleted when the connection is 
		terminated, in the same way as if the connection has been terminated by other 
		means. A Deactivate action may fail (with the ProcessingError response) if it is 
		temporarily not possible to terminate the connection.!;


resettingTimer-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!This attribute specifies the interval between certain events in the operation of 
		the protocol state machine. If the value of the attribute is changed to a new 
		value while the protocol state machine is in operation, the implementation shall 
		take the necessary steps to ensure that for any time interval which was in 
		progress when the corresponding attribute was changed, the next expiration of 
		that interval takes place no later than the expiration of the interval in 
		progress or the specified interval whichever is the sooner. The precision with 
		which this time shall be implemented shall be the same as that associated with 
		the basic operation of the timer attribute.!;

tEPackageImportedNotifications-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!Notification issued when a Transport Entity receives a PDU which is invalid or 
		contains a protocol error. The notification includes the header of the invalid 
		PDU, the source N-Address, and the reason why the PDU is considered to be in 
		error. The Reason code appears only if the protocol error relates to the 
		connection-mode protocol, and if it has been possible to relate the PDU to a 
		particular connection. The reason code is the value placed in the corresponding 
		parameter of the ER TPDU, if sent. The tEPackage imports the communicationsAlarm 
		Notification from DMI, in order to report the ProtocolError event. The 
		probableCause shall be set to TLM.communicationsProtocolError. The 
		tEProtocolErrorPDUheader, tEProtocolErrorSourceAddress and 
		tEProtocolErrorReasonCode are reported as parameters in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm. The significance 
		subparameter of each item of the problemData shall be set to the value mFalset 
		(i.e. not significant) so that a managing system receiving the event will be 
		less likely to reject it. The perceivedSeverity shall be set to Minor. A 
		subsequent communicationsAlarm with a perceivedSeverity value of TClearede shall 
		not be generated. No other fields or parameters shall be used, with the 
		exception of further parameters in the additionalInformationfield.!;

-- 5.8 Transport connection managed object and IVMO
-- 5.8.1 Transport connection managed object
-- There may be multiple instances of these Managed Objects
-- within a connection-oriented protocol Machine. Each corresponds
-- to a Transport Connection. A transportConnection is created
-- automatically as part of system operation. A transportConnection may
-- be deleted automatically as part of system operation or
-- may be deleted as a result of the deactivate management operation.
-- A transportConnectionIVMO may be used as the source
-- of initial values of attributes of a transportConnectionMO.
--
-- This section defines the Transport Connection Managed Object. The
-- Transport Connection Managed Object contains the set of attributes
-- characterizing the manageable aspects of a
-- Transport Layer Protocol Connection.
--
-- An MO of this class exists corresponding to each active Transport
-- Connection, i.e. for which a CR
-- TPDU has been sent or received and which has not yet been
-- terminated. An MO may also exist prior to transmission of a CR TPDU,
-- corresponding to interactions across the service interface.
-- The precise synchronization of the creation and deletion of the MO
-- with the protocol exchanges corresponding to the Transport Connection
-- is not however defined by this standard. For example,
-- there may be a visible delay after transmission or reception of a CR
-- TPDU or interaction at the service interface before the MO is created
-- and becomes visible to management. A Transport
-- Connection MO is not required for terminated connections whose
-- References have been placed in the Frozen state (for Class 4
-- operation), although according to the above the MO may remain
-- visible for some time after the connection has in other respects been
-- terminated.
