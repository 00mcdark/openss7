commonCreationDeletion-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		Managed object class imports the Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2 objectCreation 
		and/or objectDeletion notifications. Used as follows:

		objectCreation - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		created. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification. If creation occurred as a result of internal operation of the 
		resource, the value 'resourceOperation' is used. If creation occurred in 
		response to a management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A 
		value of 'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source 
		of the operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.

		objectDeletion - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		deleted. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification. If deletion occurred as a result of internal operation of the 
		resource, the value 'resourceOperation' is used. If deletion occurred in 
		response to a management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A 
		value of 'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source 
		of the operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.;


commonStateChange-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		Managed object class imports the Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2 stateChange 
		notification. Used to report the changes to the operationalState attribute, and 
		where present, the administrativeState attribute. A single parameter set is 
		included in the State change definition field. Only the (mandatory) attributeId 
		and (optional) newAttributeValue parameters are used.;

commonDeactivateConnection-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		Managed object class imports the Recommendation X.723 | ISO/IEC 10165 deactivate 
		action. The deactivate action causes the connection to be terminated. The 
		termination should occur as rapidly as practical, but no particular time 
		constraints are implied. Typically, this action simulates a disconnect request 
		received across the service interface. If a more rapid means for terminating the 
		connection exists, then this should be used. The termination shall occur in 
		conformance to the protocol standard.

		The Managed Object remains in existence after completion of the deactivate 
		action. It is subsequently deleted when the connection is terminated, in the 
		same way as if the connection had been terminated by other means. A deactivate 
		action may fail (with the ProcessingFailure response) if it is temporarily not 
		possible to terminate the connection.;


fRMRReceivedCommunicationsAlarm-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		Managed object imports the Recommendation X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2 
		communicationsAlarm notification. Used to report the following conditions:

		fRMRReceived - A FRMR frame is received. The received FRMR frame is reported as 
		additionalInformation in the notification, using the fRMR parameter. The 
		significance sub-parameter shall be set as described above.

		The probableCause parameter is set to the value communicationsProtocolError.

		The value DLM.fRMRReceived shall be reported in the specificProblems parameter. 
		In addition, the reason why the frame was sent is also returned in 
		specificProblems. Values are specified in the DLM ASN.1 module for 
		controlFieldUndefinedOrUnimplemented, infoFieldLengthGreaterThanMaximum, 
		invalidNR, formatError, and nonSpecific.

		The perceivedSeverity parameter is set to the value Minor. A subsequent 
		communicationsAlarm with a perceivedSeverity value of Cleared is not generated. 
		No other parameters are used.;


sLPConnection-sLPPM-Automatic-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The name binding which applies when an sLPConnection managed object (or an 
		instance of a subclass of the sLPConnection MO class) is created automatically 
		by the operation of the system as a subordinate object of an sLPPM managed 
		object (or subclass), and deleted automatically.

		The creation of an instance of an sLPConnection MO (or subclass) using this name 
		binding may reference an instance of the sLPConnectionIVMO (or subclass). The 
		means by which an instance (if any) of the sLPConnectionIVMO are identified are 
		a local matter. When this occurs, some of the initial values of the attributes 
		of the instance of the sLPConnection MO may be supplied by the values of the 
		attributes in the specified instance of sLPConnectionIVMO.

		However, any such value may be overridden by a value supplied by local means 
		(for example across an internal interface). Where values are supplied by the 
		IVMO, the initial value of an attribute of the sLPConnection MO shall be the 
		value of the corresponding attribute in the sLPConnectionIVMO (that is, which 
		has the same attribute template label). The naming attribute of the 
		sLPConnection MO is assigned a value according to local mechanisms.;


sLPConnection-sLPPM-Management-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The name binding which applies when an sLPConnection managed object (or an

eWMAMetricMonitor-P-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		See "EWMA Metric Monitor Behavior" in clause B.3.1.3. for general behaviour of 
		this object. The detailed smoothing algorithm for estimateOfMean is as follows:

		The estimate of the mean (estimateOfMean), ~V(t), is defined to be a weighted 
		moving average of a gauge, ~V[t]. The specified weighting is exponential. The 
		algorithm has the property that more recent event occurrences in the moving time 
		period are "weighted" more heavily than older occurrences. The exponentially 
		weighted moving average (EWMA) is defined by the following recursive algorithm.

		~V[t] = ~V[t - GP] + GP * (V[t] - ~V[t - GP])/T1

		where

		t, is the current value of time,

		V[t], is the value of the gauge (derivedGuage) at time t,

		~V[t], is the estimate of the mean (estimateOfMean) of the gauge V[t] at time t,

		~V[t - GP], is the estimate of the mean of the gauge V[t] at time (t-GP), the 
		last estimate of the mean,

		GP, is the time between the last observation of V[t] and the current observation 
		constrained to be a positive value larger than zero (granularityPeriod). It is 
		sufficient to have a best effort to make GP a constant value.

		T1, is the time constant of the exponentially weighted moving average with the 
		same units as GP. T1 is defined by the equation T = (MTP + GP)/2.

		MTP, is the moving time period (movingTimePeriod) over which the mean is 
		estimated.

		MTP must be greater than or equal to GP. Therefore the value of T1 is greater 
		than or equal to GP.

		When GP = MTP the calculated mean value for the gauge becomes the current gauge 
		value, i.e. ~V[t] = V[t].

		Both GP and MTP can be reset by the managing system. This mean time period, T1, 
		can be chosen to be integer multiples of the granularity period, GP.

		The initial condition (or reset condition) of the EWMA of the estimated mean is 
		provided by setting the estimateOfMean attribute.

		The units of ~V[t] are the same as the units of the gauge to which the estimate 
		of the mean is applied.;


counterDifference-P-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		V[t] = [counter[t] - counter[t-GP]]

		where

		V[t], is the difference between successive observations of the counter,

		counter[t], is the value of the counter at the current time t (not save in any 
		attribute),

		counter[t-GP], is the previous value of the counter at time t-GP (i.e., 
		counterTMinusGP),

		GP, is the sampling interval in units of time (Granularity Period).

		The initial value of counter[t-GP] determines the initial difference value.

		Whenever the metric object transitions from locked to unlocked status, the first 
		scan is treated in a special manner.

		On first scan

		counter[t-GP] <- observed counter

		derivedGuage <- unspecified, if retrieved returns error parameter

		pDerivedGuageNotCurrent

		estimateOfMean <- either as initialized or value when last locked

		On second or subsequent scans

		read observed counter

		derivedGuage <- observed counter - counter[t-GP]

		counter[t-GP] <- observed counter

		estimate of mean <- results of EWMA summarization function;


severityIndicatingThreshold-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		This attribute type has all the behaviour of a gauge-threshold attribute type, 
		as defined in clause 8.4.2 of ISO/IEC 10165-2. As an enhancement to the syntax 
		of the gauge-Threshold attribute type it adds an optional severityIndication 
		parameter to the syntax of both the notifyHigh and notifyLow submembers within 
		each threshold level member. This attribute type has additional behaviour 
		associated with these optional perceivedSeverity indication parameters, which is 
		defined as follows:

		- If the notify-high's switch is on, the notify-high's severityIndication value 
		  shall be reported in the perceivedSeverity parameter of any notification 
		  triggered by the gauge value crossing the notify-high's guageThreshold value 
		  in the positive going direction.

		- If the notify-low's switch is on, the notify-low's severityIndication value 
		  shall be reported in the perceivedSeverity parameter of any notification 
		  triggered by the gauge value corssing the notify-low's guageThreshold value in 
		  the negative going direction.

		If both swtiches are on for a single thresholdLevel, one of the 
		severityIndication values shall be "clear".;


counterOverflow-P-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The gauge value derived (V[t]) is calculated using the following method:

		If [counter[t] - counter[t-GP]] is positive

		V[t] is evaluated as defined by bCounterDifference behaviour

		If [counter[t] - coutner[t-GP]] is negative

		V[t] = [counter[t] - counter[t-GP] + modulus value].

		If the value of the modulus value attribute is zero the actual modulus value 
		used to evaluate V[t] is a local matter.;

-- E.1 Introduction
--
-- In complete intermediate systems, such as a repeater, some attributes and actions are necessary to fill out the 
-- management of a complete system.  These items are generic in the sense that they are required for managed systems in 
-- general.  The following items are defined to aid in the completeness of this International Standard, although it is 
-- recognized that they are outside the bounds of the definition are for a layer 2 standard.
--
-- E.2 Scope
--
-- This annex defines additional attributes and an action that are necessary to the management of a complete 
-- intermediate system such as a repeater.  They are not specifically related to a Data Link Management Standard.
--
-- When a generic systems management standard is available with these definitions (or similar), it is expected that this 
-- portion of this International Standard will be removed.
