MODULE "ISO/IEC 10733" { joint-iso-ccitt network-layer(13) }
-- 6.2 Common Network Layer GDMO Definitions
-- The following templates are referred to from multiple objects.
--
-- Behaviours

commonCreationDeletion-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!Managed object class imports the 10165-2 objectCreation and objectDeletion 
		notifications. Used as follows:

		objectCreation - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		created. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification.
		
		If creation occured as a result of internal operation of the resource, the 
		value 'resourceOperation' is used.  If creation occured in response to a 
		management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A value of 
		'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source of the 
		operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.

		objectDeletion - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is 
		deleted. Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in 
		the notification.
		
		If deletion occured as a result of internal operation of the resource, the 
		value 'resourceOperation' is used.  If deletion occured in response to a 
		management operation, the value 'managementOperation' is used. A value of 
		'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to determine the source of the 
		operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.!;


commonStateChange-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!Managed object class imports the 10165-2 stateChange notification. Used to 
		report the changes to the operationalState attribute, and where present, the 
		administrativeState attribute. A single parameter set is included in the State 
		change definition field. Only the (mandatory) attributeId and (optional) 
		newAttributeValue parameters are used.!;


octetsSentReceivedCounter-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The octetsSentCounter and octetsReceivedCounter shall count only user data 
		octets in valid data packets. They shall not count user data octets in data 
		packets which are rejected for any reason, nor user data octets in non data 
		packets;


successfulConnectionEstablishment-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		This Package imports the communicationsInformation notification from "Rec. X.723 
		| ISO/IEC 10165-5".  It is used to report the following events.

		successfulConnectionEstablishment: Generated when a connection is successfully 
		established. However, the precise synchronization between the notification and 
		the corresponding protocol and service interface interactions is not defined by 
		this standard.  The value NLM.successfulConnectionEstablishment shall be reported 
		in the informationType field.;
-- 6.3 The Network Subsystem Managed Object
--	Managed Object for Network Layer Subsystem
--	There is exactly one of these MOs within a system.  It exists to provide a container for the
--	Network Entity MOs, nSAP MOs and the X.25 PLE MOs and IVMOs.
--	The networkSubsystem managed object can not be created or deleted 
--	explicitly by management operation. It exists inherently in a system;
--	created and deleted as part of system operation.

cLNS8473PImportedCounters-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The cLNS8473-P package imports octetsSentCounter and octetsReceivedCounter from 
		DIS 10165-2. They are used to count the number of octets of data transmitted or 
		received by the local network entity in ISO 8473 Data PDUs. (i.e. those which 
		which have a source or destination N-Address, respectively, which corresponds to 
		that of the local netwerk entity.);


cLNS8473PImportedNotifications-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The cLNS8473-P package imports the communicationsAlarm notification from Rec. 
		721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2.  It is used to report the following cLNS managed object 
		events.
		
		pDUDiscard: Generated when a data NPDU is discarded due to any of the reasons 
		specified in ISO 8473 Table 7, with the exception of `PDU Discarded due to 
		Congestion' The header of the PDU in error shall be reported as a parameter in 
		the additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationPDUHeader PARAMETER.
		
		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it. The value 
		NLM.pDUDiscard and that corresponding to the Reason For Discard shall both be 
		reported in the specificProblems parameter.
		
		The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.  A PDU which does not contain one of the 
		protocol identifiers defined in ISO 8473 shall not cause this event.
		
		A PDU with a protocol ID 1000 0001 shall not cause this event if it does not 
		also contain the Version/Protocol Identifier extension in clause 7.2.4 of ISO 
		8473.  If an error report PDU is generated, the PDU header and Discard Reason in 
		the error report shall be the same as those in the corresponding notification.;


operationalSystemTypeIV-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		If the cLNS MO is created by management operation (using the 
		cLNS-networkEntity-Management name binding), the initial value of the 
		operationalSystemType attribute shall be specified in the CMIP create. 
		Otherwise, the value shall be determined in an implementation specific manner. 
		The value shall be one of those present in the cLNSSystemTypes attribute of the 
		superior Network Entity MO. A value of ES indicates that the system shall 
		perform no 8473 forwarding operations upon non-local CLN-P PDUs. A value of IS 
		indicates that the system is permitted to perform forwarding operations, but the 
		decision to forward individual PDUs, or not to forward them, shall be taken on 
		the basis of the available routing information.;

	DEFINED AS
		This package imports the communicationsInformation notification from Rec. X.723 
		| ISO/IEC 10165-5.  It is used to report the following events.

		iSReachabilityChange: Generated when an ES or IS detects a change in the 
		reachability of a neighboring IS.  The value NLM.iSReachabilityChange shall be 
		reported in the informationType field.

		The new State, NET of the IS concerned, snpaAddress (where available) and the 
		reason for the change shall be reported in the informationData field using the 
		reachabilityChange PARAMETER.;


linkage-ISO9542IsImportedInformationNotifications-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		This package imports the communicationsInformation notification from Rec. X.723 
		| ISO/IEC 10165-5.  It is used to report the following events.

		eSReachabilityChange: Generated when an IS detects a change in the reachability 
		of a neighboring ES.  The value NLM.eSReachabilityChange shall be reported in the 
		informationType field.

		The new State, set of NSAPAddresses of the IS concerned, the snpaAddress (where 
		available) and the reason for the change shall be reported in the

		invalid9542PDU: Generated when an ISO 9542 PDU is received which is discarded as 
		result of the PDU Header Error Detection or Protocol Error Processing Functions 
		specified in ISO 9542.
		
		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it.

		The value NLM.iSO9542PDUDiscard shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.;

x25PLEPImportedNotifications-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The x25PLE-P package imports the communicationsAlarm notification from Rec. 
		X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2.  It is used to report the following x25PLE managed 
		object events.

		providerInitiatedDisconnect: Issued upon receipt of a clear packet with a cause 
		code other than `DTE initiated'.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER.

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it.  The value 
		NLM.providerInitiatedDisconnect shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.

		remotelyInitiatedReset: Issued upon occurance of a remotely initiated reset. 
		This event is issued in lieu of a 'providerInitiatedReset' when operating in a 
		DTE-DXE environment.  The information relating to the packet shall be reported as 
		a parameter in the additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using 
		the notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it. The value 
		NLM.remotelyInitiatedDisconnect shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter.  The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.

		providerInitiatedReset: Issued upon occurance of a provider initiated reset.  
		This event is issued when operating in a DTE-DCE environment.  The information 
		relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it. The value 
		NLM.providerInitiatedReset shall be reported in the specificProblems parameter.  
		The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.

		remotelyInitiatedRestart: Issued upon receipt of a remotely (including provider) 
		initiated restart.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it. The value 
		NLM.remotelyInitiatedRestart shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.

		restartCountExceeded: Issued on restart failure due to restart count (R20) 
		exceeded.  The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a 
		parameter in the additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using 
		the notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it.

		The value NLM.restartCountExceeded shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter.  The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.

		protocolErrorDetectedLocally: Issued upon receipt of a packet which causes the 
		"A=Error" action in the ISO 8208 state tables to be taken.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER.
		
		The values of cause diagnosand diagnostic codes shall be those which would have 
		been placed in a diagnostic packet had one been generated by the DTE (i.e. as 
		if it were a DTE). The actual generation of such a packet is not required.

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it.  The value 
		NLM.communicationsProtocolErrorDetectedLocally shall be reported in the 
		specificProblems parameter.

		The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.

		accusedOfProtocolError: Issued upon receipt of a diagnostic packet or a clear, 
		reset or restart packet with a cause code equal to `protocol error'. No other 
		x25PLE communication alarm shall be generated as a result of this particular 
		instance of packet.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it.  The value 
		NLM.accusedOfProtocolError shall be reported in the specificProblems parameter.  
		The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.

		callEstablishmentRetryCountExceeded: Issued on retry failure during call 
		establishment due to retry limit exceeded.

		The information relating to the call shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it.  The value 
		NLM.callEstablishmentRetryCountExceeded shall be reported in the 
		specificProblems parameter.

		The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in 
		the AdditionalInformation field.

		clearCountExceeded: Issued on retry failure due to clear limit (R23) exceeded.  
		The information relating to the call shall be reported as a parameter in the 
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the 
		notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be 
		set to the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system 
		receiving the event report will be less likely to reject it.

		The value NLM.clearCountExceeded shall be reported in the specificProblems 
		parameter.  The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm 
		with a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other 
		fields or parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in
