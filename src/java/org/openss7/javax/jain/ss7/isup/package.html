This package provides the <a href="http://www.openss7.org/">OpenSS7 Project</a>
implementations of the vendor-specific components of the JAIN ISUP API.  In
particular, it provides the JAIN ISUP stack and provider implementation classes.

The
<a href="JainIsupStackImpl.html">JainIsupStackImpl</a>
class implements the vendor-specification stack implementation class of the
JAIN ISUP API as provided by the
<a href="../../../../../../javax/jain/ss7/isup/JainIsupStack.html">JainIsupStack</a>
interface.  Instances of this class are obtained using the
<a href="../../../../../../javax/jain/ss7/JainSS7Factory.html">JainSS7Factory</a>
object with a path name of <code>org.openss7</code> and an object name of
<code>javax.jain.ss7.isup.JainIsupStackImpl</code>. <p>

Each
<a href="JainIsupStackImpl.html">JainIsupStackImpl</a>
object created in this fashion represents a single, unique, local network and
signalling point code (network appearance).  For additional local signalling
point codes, an additional
<a href="JainIsupStackImpl.html">JainIsupStackImpl</a>
object should be acquired and appropriately configured using the
<a href="JainIsupStackImpl.html#setNetworkIndicator:NetworkIndicator">setNetworkIndicator()</a>,
<a href="JainIsupStackImpl.html#setSignalingPointCode:SignalingPointCode">setSignalingPointCode()</a> or
<a href="JainIsupStackImpl.html#setVendorName:String">setVendorName()</a>
methods.
In the <a href="http://www.openss7.org/">OpenSS7</a> implementation of the JAIN
ISUP stack vendor class, each instance of the vendor class corresponds to a
local binding of the ISUP stack. <p>

Each
<a href="JainIsupStackImpl.html">JainIsupStackImpl</a>
can be used to acquire new instances of the
<a href="JainIsupProviderImpl.html">JainIsupProviderImpl</a>
object using the
<a href="JainIsupStackImpl.html#createProvider:">createProvider()</a> method.
The vendor-specific provider class happens to be called
<code>org.openss7.javax.jain.ss7.isup.JainIsupProviderImpl</code>, but this is
not mandated by the JAIN ISUP API specification as it is for the
<a href="JainIsupStackImpl.html">JainIsupStackImpl</a>
object.
In the <a href="http://www.openss7.org/">OpenSS7</a> implementation of the JAIN
ISUP provider vendor class, each instance of the vendor class corresponds to a
locallly bound ISUP stack stream. <p>

User classes that implement the
<a href="../../../../../../javax/jain/ss7/isup/JainIsupListener.html">JainIsupListener</a>
interface can register to send and receive events with a
<a href="JainIsupProviderImpl.html">JainIsupProviderImpl</a>
object for a given ISUP address.  The ISUP address consists of the local
signalling point code to which the provider is already bound, the remote
signalling point code (of the remote switch), and the circuit identification
code range identifying circuits between the two signalling points.
