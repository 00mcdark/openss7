Interface SpeechRecognitionEvent

   All Superinterfaces:
          MediaEvent<SignalDetector>, ResourceEvent<SignalDetector>,
          SignalDetectorEvent
     _________________________________________________________________

public interface SpeechRecognitionEvent

   extends SignalDetectorEvent

   Describes the result of a speech recognition.

   Basic speech-enabled applications can use getTag() and/or
   getUserInput() , as shown below:

   Assuming that the following grammar was set as a pattern of the
   SignalDetector:
 <grammar version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/grammar"
         xml:lang="en-US" tag-format="semantics/1.0-literals" root="answer">
    <rule id="answer" scope="public">

       <one-of>
          <item><ruleref uri="#yes"/></item>
          <item><ruleref uri="#no"/></item>
       </one-of>

    </rule>

    <rule id="yes">
       <one-of>
          <item>yes</item>
          <item>yeah<tag>yes</tag></item>

          <item><token>you bet</token><tag>yes</tag></item>
          <item xml:lang="fr-CA">oui<tag>yes</tag></item>

       </one-of>
    </rule>
    <rule id="no">
       <one-of>
          <item>no</item>

          <item>nope</item>
          <item>no way</item>
       </one-of>
       <tag>no</tag>

    </rule>
 </grammar>


   In the SignalDetector listener:
  class AppSignalDetectorListener implements MediaEventListener<SignalDetectorE
vent> {
      public void onEvent(SignalDetectorEvent anEvent) {
          if (anEvent instanceof SpeechRecognitionEvent) {
             String tag = ((SpeechRecognitionEvent)anEvent).getTag();
             if (tag != null) {
                 if (tag.equals("yes")) {
                    log.debug("customer agrees");
                    ...
                 } else {
                    log.debug("customer disagrees");
                    ...
                 }
             } else {
                 log.debug("Please say yes or no");
                 ...
             }
          }
      }
  }


   More complex applications will use the xml document returned by
   getSemanticResult().

   The parameter SignalDetectorConstants.p_InitialTimeout applies also
   for speech recognition. If no input is detected, getQualifier() will
   return SignalDetectorConstants.q_InitialTimeout.

   If the recognized was unable to match the input with any grammar,
   getQualifier() returns q_NoMatch.
     _________________________________________________________________

   Field Summary
   static Symbol q_NoMatch
             This qualifier indicates that the recognizer could not match
   the input with any grammar.
   static Symbol v_EndOfSpeech
             A predefined pattern that matches the end of a speech
   sequence.
   static Symbol v_StartOfSpeech
             A predefined pattern that matches the start of a speech
   sequence.



   Method Summary
    java.net.URL getSemanticResult()
             Return the URL of a semantic interpretation document, either
   NSLML (http://www.w3.org/TR/nl-spec/) or EMMA
   (http://www.w3.org/TR/emma/).
    java.lang.String getTag()
             Return the tag associated to the user input, as defined by
   SISR.
    java.lang.String getUserInput()
             Return the recognized utterance, as a String.

   Field Detail

  v_StartOfSpeech

static final Symbol v_StartOfSpeech

          A predefined pattern that matches the start of a speech
          sequence.
          This Symbol is used as a special pattern value. The pattern
          will be matched by the start of a speech sequence.

          Example:

params.put(p_Pattern[5], v_StartOfSpeech);

          This can be used to generate a SpeechRecognitionEvent, either
          by adding p_Pattern[5] in the patterns argument of
          receiveSignals, or by adding ev_Pattern[5] in the list of
          events subscribed by p_EnabledEvents.
          Additionally, rtcc_Pattern[5] can be used as an RTC trigger.

          See also How to define a Pattern
     _________________________________________________________________

  v_EndOfSpeech

static final Symbol v_EndOfSpeech

          A predefined pattern that matches the end of a speech sequence.
          See v_StartOfSpeech.
     _________________________________________________________________

  q_NoMatch

static final Symbol q_NoMatch

          This qualifier indicates that the recognizer could not match
          the input with any grammar.

   Method Detail

  getTag

java.lang.String getTag()

          Return the tag associated to the user input, as defined by
          SISR. (See http://www.w3.org/TR/semantic-interpretation/)
          Return null if no tag was specified, or if multiple tags were
          matched with various confidence levels. In those cases, the
          semantic result returned by getSemanticResult() must be used.
     _________________________________________________________________

  getUserInput

java.lang.String getUserInput()

          Return the recognized utterance, as a String.
          Return null if no utterance was recognized, or if multiple
          utterances were recognized with various confidence levels. In
          those cases, the semantic result returned by
          getSemanticResult() must be used.
     _________________________________________________________________

  getSemanticResult

java.net.URL getSemanticResult()

          Return the URL of a semantic interpretation document, either
          NSLML (http://www.w3.org/TR/nl-spec/) or EMMA
          (http://www.w3.org/TR/emma/). This document describes in detail
          what words were recognized in the utterance, with confidence
          levels, and what is their meaning.
          Return null if no document is provided.
