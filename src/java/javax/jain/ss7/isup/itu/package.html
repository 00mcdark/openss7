This package contains the classes for ITU only ISUP events and parameters.  The
<code>isup</code> package lists the events and parameters that are common to
ITU and ANSI variants.  The commonality in events can be in varying degrees.
The events and parameters that ahave the same format in ITU and ANSI are not
extended in either package and are part of the <code>isup</code> package only.
For example <a href="../MainControl.html">MainControl</a> is an event that is
common to ITU and ANSI variants and resides in the <code>isup</code> package.
<p>

The events and parameters that are unique to ITU reside in the <code>itu</code>
package and also the events that are in the <code>isup</code> package but have
additional ITU parameters will reside in this package.  For example
<a href="EventReleaseResponseItu.html">EventReleaseResponseItu</a> is an event
where the <code>itu</code> package has an additional Cause Indicator parameter
that is not defined in the <code>ansi</code> package. <p>

The constructor classes for the Events in the <code>itu</code> package will
include the ones in the base class and add to them the ITU only mandatory
parameters.  The ITU only optional parameters may be set by calling the
appropriate methods on the Event class. <p>

The constructor for the ITU only parameters initialize the parameter sub-fields
to their spare values (as in the core package) and methods are provided to get
and set each of the sub-field values. <p>

An application that runs on an ITU variant of the ISUP layer will include the
<code>isup</code> and <code>itu</code> packages of the API.
