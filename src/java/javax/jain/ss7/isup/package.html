This package contains the interfaces that represent ISUP protocol stack and JAIN ISUP
applications, and methods for sending and receiving JAIN ISUP events between them, along
with class definitions for common ITU and ANSI events and parameters. <p>

The implementation of the two stack vendor specific interfaces, namely JainIsupStack and
JainIsupProvider will be vendor specific, however the naming of JainIsupStack proprietory
implementations is mandated.  This is as per JAIN convention.  The class name of the
vendor specific implementations must be the JAIN ISUP "InterfaceName" of which that class
implements with "Impl" appended to the end of it. For example a vendor implementation of
the JainIsupStack Interface must be called "JainIsupStackImpl". Therefore once each vendor
has implemented the JAIN ISUP API specification they must has two proprietary classes
called JainIsupStackImpl.class and .class implementing the JainIsupProvider interface.
The characteristics of the three main interfaces are listed below: <ul>

<li> <a href="JainIsupStack.html">JainIsupStack</a>: This Interface is the central point
for the creation of JainIsupProviders.  From within the JainIsupStack Object it is
possible for any application to get a list of JainIsupProvider objects that are attached
to the underlying JainIsupStack by using the
<a href="JainIsupStack.html#getProviderList()">getProviderList</a> method with the
JainIsupStack Object. This method returns an ArrayList of JainIsupProvider references to
which a JainIsupListener Object may register.  The purpose of defining a JainIsupStack
object is to use it as a means of provisioning the ISUP stack via the JAIN OAM&amp;P
interface.

<li> <a href="JainIsupProvider.html">JainIsupProvider</a>: This Interface defines the
methods for adding &amp; deleteing JainIsupListeners from a list of registered
JainIsupListeners held within the JainIsupProvider.  The JainIsupListener registers with a
JainIsupProvider for one or more <a href="IsupUserAddress.html">User Address</a>. User
Address consists of a destination point code and a set of CICs between the self point code
and the destination point code. The User Address also contains a Network Indicator field
which indicates whether the point code is an International or a National point code.

<li> <a href="JainIsupListener.html">JainIsupListener</a>: This Interface defines the
methods required by all JainIsupListeners to receive and process the ISUP Events generated
by a JainIsupProvider. A JainIsupProvider receives ISUP protocol messages out of the ISUP
stack layer and encapsulates them into Events and passes them to the JainIsupListener.  As
mentioned above this occurs by Event passing, were the JainIsupProvider invokes the
<a href="JainIsupListener.html#processIsupEvent()">processIsupEvent</a> and passes the
relevant Event within the method to the JainIsupListener.  <p>

A JainIsupListener registers with a JainIsupProvider to become an Event Listener of that
JainIsupProvider. It registers with an object reference to itself along with a ISUP User
Address. These two values are stored by the JainIsupProvider and the User Address is used
as a lookup to obtain an object reference to a specific JainIsupListener. A
JainIsupListener can listen on multiple User Addresses and this is done by repeatedly
calling the <a href="JainIsupProvider.html#addIsupListener()">addIsupListener</a> method
with the different User Addresses the Listener wants to monitor.  <p>

The multiple User Address, allows the JainIsupListener to operate with many nodes in the
network using different destination point code parameter and CIC ranges in the User
Address. </ul>

Besides the above three key interfaces, the isup package also contains the following
classes : <ul>

<li> <a href="IsupEvent.html">IsupEvent</a>: This class is the parent class of all ISUP
Events and provides methods to access all the parameters that are common to all the ISUP
Events. In JAIN ISUP, the "Event" prefix is attached to all Event classes to distinguish
them from the Parameter classes and the interfaces . eg. EventAlert, EventAnswer etc.
Each ISUP Event is composed of different parameters, some mandatory and some optional. The
constructors for the Event classes are a function of the mandatory parameters.  The
optional parameters may be set by additionally calling the appropriate methods.
Parameters which make up the Events may be of either the base type or may be classes
themselves.  The parameter class constructors initialize the parameter sub-fields to their
spare values. Each of the sub-field in a parameter may be set by calling the appropriate
method on the parameter class.  <p>

The isup package contains the Events and Parameter classes common to ITU and ANSI
variants.  <p>

The list of ISUP events specified in the JAIN ISUP API phase I are as follows:
Alert,
Answer,
CallFailureInd,
IsupErrorInd,
MaintControl,
MaintTmoInd,
NwStatusInd,
ReattemptInd,
Release,
ReleaseResponse,
Setup,
StartResetInd and
StopMaintReq.

<li> <a href="IsupUserAddress.html">IsupUserAddress</a>: This class defines the ISUP User
Address object which is used in the registration process for message distribution by the
ISUP Provider to the different Listener applications.  </ul>
