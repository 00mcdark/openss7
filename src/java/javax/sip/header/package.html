<p class=MsoNormal>This package contains all the headers interfaces supported
by this specification. SIP header fields are similar to HTTP header fields in
both syntax and semantics. This specification models each SIP header as a
specific interface as opposed to have a single generic interface to handle all
header information. It is deemed more explicit for protocol support to define
protocol characteristics as opposed to generic interfaces. This specification
supports all the headers defined in RFC 3261 and other headers introduced by
supporting the following additional RFC's:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>RFC3262 - <span
     class=SpellE>RAckHeader</span> and <span class=SpellE>RSeqHeaders</span>
     for the reliable delivery of provisional responses.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>RFC3265 - <span
     class=SpellE>AllowEventsHeader</span>, <span class=SpellE>EventHeader</span>
     and <span class=SpellE>SubscriptionStateHeader</span> to support the event
     notification framework.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>RFC3326 - <span
     class=SpellE>ReasonHeader</span> to support information on why the request
     was issued.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>RFC3515 - <span
     class=SpellE>ReferToHeader</span> to support recipients to refer requests
     to another resource</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>RFC3903 &#8211; <span
     class=SpellE>SIPETagHeader</span> and <span class=SpellE>SIPIfMatchHeader</span>
     for publishing event state used within the SIP Events framework. </li>
</ul>

<p>This specification also provides a mechanism to support other extension
Headers. If a SIP stack vendor supports such extension headers these must
extend the <span class=SpellE>ExtensionHeader</span> interface, which contains
header name and header value attributes. </p>

<p>Additionally this package contains a <span class=SpellE>HeaderFactory</span>
class that defines methods for creating new headers. The <span class=SpellE>HeaderFactory</span>
is a singleton object, which can be obtained from the {@link <span
class=SpellE>javax.sip.SipFactory</span>}. </p>
