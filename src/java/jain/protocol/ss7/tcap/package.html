This package provides the Classes and Exceptions required to represent JAIN
TCAP protocol stacks, JAIN TCAP applications, as well as the Classes and
Exceptions needed to send and receive JAIN TCAP primitives. The implementation
of the two stack vendor specific interfaces, namely JainTcapStack and
JainTcapProvider will be vendor specific, however the naming of these
proprietory implementations is mandated.  The class name of the vendor specific
implementations must be the JAIN TCAP &quot;InterfaceName&quot; of which that
class implements with &quot;Impl&quot; appended to the end of it. For example a
vendor implementation of the JainTcapStack Interface must be called
&quot;JainTcapStackImpl&quot;.  Therefore once each vendor has implemented the
JAIN TCAP API specification they must has two proprietary classes called
JainTcapStackImpl.class and JainTcapProviderImpl.class. The characteristics of
the three main interfaces are listed below: <ul>

<li> <a href="JainTcapStack.html">JainTcapStack</a>:
This Interface defines the minimial management properties that enables the JAIN
TCAP API specification to operate independently of the JAIN OAM API
Specification. Therefore the JainTcapStack Object is a representation of the
main management functionality of the TCAP layer, as well as the central point
for the creation of JainTcapProviders.  From within the JainTcapStack Object it
is possible for any application to get a list of JainTcapProvider objects that
are attached to the underlying JainTcapStack by using the
<a href="JainTcapStack.html#getProviderList()">getProviderList</a> method
with the JainTcapStack Object. This method returns an ArrayList
of JainTcapProvider references of which a JainTcapListener Object may register.
Similiarly if the JainTcapStack Object has no JainTcapProviders attached
to it, the JainTcapListener may use the <a href="JainTcapStack.html#createProvider()">createProvider method</a> to create a new JainTcapProvider object.<br>
<br>
<BR></li>

<li> <a href="JainTcapProvider.html">JainTcapProvider</a>:
This Interface defines the methods for adding JainTcapListeners to, and
removing JainTcapListeners from a list of registered JainTcapListeners held
within the JainTcapProvider.  The JainTcapListener registers with a
JainTcapProvider with a <a href="JainAddress.html">User Address</a>, this is
explained in more detail in the definition of a
<a href="JainTcapListener.html">JainTcapListener</a> below. Other methods
defined within the JainTcapProvider provide the functionality for a
JainTcapListener to obtain a Dialogue with another JainTcapListener based on a
Dialogue Id. The JainTcapProvider also defines the functionality to obtain
Invoke Id's based on a specific Dialogue Id, that enables a JainTcapListener to
Invoke operations on another JainTcapListener to which a Dialogue has been
initiated. In order for communication to take place between a local
JainTcapListener and a remote JainTcapListener, the local JainTcapListener must
send a number of <a href="ComponentReqEvent.html">Component Request Events</a>
interspersed by <a href="DialogueReqEvent.html">Dialogue Request Events</a> to
it's associated JainTcapProvider. The Jain User Address of the remote
JainTcapListener should be set in the appropriate Dialogue Request Events.<br>
<br>
<BR></li>

<li> <a href="JainTcapListener.html">JainTcapListener</a>:
This Interface defines the methods required by all JainTcapListeners to receive
and process Events that are emitted by a JainTcapProvider. A remote
JainTcapProvider which receives Component Indications and a Dialogue Indication
(which were sent by the local JainTcapListener) out of the TCAP layer of its
SS7 protocol stack, encapsulates them as Events and passes them to the remote
JainTcapListener.  As mentioned above this occurs by Event passing, were the
remote JainTcapProvider invokes the
<a href="JainTcapListener.html#processComponentIndEvent(jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.ComponentIndEvent)">processComponentIndEvent</a>
and
<a href="JainTcapListener.html#processDialogueIndEvent(jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.DialogueIndEvent)">processDialogueIndEvent</a>
as appropriate and passes the relevant Event within the method to the remote
JainTcapListener.  The same process occurs when the local JainTcapProvider
passes Indication Events (received from the remote JainTcapListener) to the
local JainTcapListener.<br>
<BR><ul>

<li>A JainTcapListener registers with a JainTcapProvider to become an Event
Listener of that JainTcapProvider, it registers with an object reference to
itself and its Jain User Address. These two values are stored by the
JainTcapProvider and the Jain User Address is used as a lookup to obtain an
object reference to a specific JainTcapListener. The Jain User Address is used
for the routing of Tcap messages between various local and remote
JainTcapListeners.&nbsp;<br>
<BR></li>

<li>A JainTcapListener may have multiple Tcap User Addresses, which enables it
to operate over a number of Sub-Systems, however the JainTcapListener may only
register with a JainTcapProvider, with only one Tcap User Address at any
specific time. For example if a specific JainTcapListenerImpl (application
developer specific implementation of the JainTcapListener interface), which
operates over two Jain User Addresses, wants to register itself for both tcap
User Adresses with the same JainTcapProviderImpl (vendor specific
implementation of the JainTcapProvider interface), then the
JainTcapListenerImpl will have to invoke the
<a href="JainTcapProvider.html#addJainTcapListener(jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.JainTcapListener, jain.address.JainAddress)">addJainTcapListener</a>
method within the JainTcapProviderImpl twice, once for each Jain User
Address.&nbsp; <br></li>

<li>The Jain User Address methods defined within the JainTcapListener
interface, provide the functionality that enables the JainTcapListenerImpl to
manipulate and maintain the list of Tcap User Addresses it supports.</li>
</ul></li>


</ul>
<b>Note:</b> <p>&nbsp;The cardinality of the relationship between
JainTcapListeners and JainTcapProviders is not restricted in any way. The
restriction of this cardinality is dependent on a vendors specific
implementation of the JAIN TCAP API, were the necessary exceptions are thrown
if the specificied cardinality is violated.  However it is mandated that there
may only be one JainTcapStack Object for the TCAP Layer of an SS7 protocol
stack.
