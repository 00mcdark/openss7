This package contains all of the classes and interfaces required to provision
and maintain an SS7 stack at MTP Level 3. <ul>

<li> The MTP Level 3 can support multiple local signalling points
(OwnSignallingPointMBean).  That is, multiple logical signalling points in the
case of a loop back configuration.

<li> Each local signalling point can configure its own MTP Level 3 timers.

<li> The MTP Level 3 SAP (Mtp3SapMBean) represents any signalling point.  On
its own, the MTP Level 3 SAP represents a remote signalling point, and is
extended by OwnSignallingPointMBean to represent a local signalling point.

<li> Each OwnSignallingPointMBean may have a number of ScreeningTableMBeans
associated with it.  The ScreeningTableMBean allows the optional SS7
functionality of an STP to identify and to handle unauthorized SS7 messages.
It identifies valid destination signalling points (Mtp3SapMBeans).

<li> Each RouteSetMBean has a destination signalling point (Mtp3SapMBean)
associated with it.

<li> Each LinkMBean has a single Mtp3SapMBean associated with it.  The MTP
Level 2 SAP holds the characteristics of the physical link and port (currently
only the clocking type). </ul>
