This package contains all of the classes and interfaces required to provision
and maintain an SS7 stack at the SCCP level. <ul>

<li> A routing control function (SccpRoutingControlMBean) shall controls the
SCCp routing for a single local signalling point (OwnSignallingPointMBean).
Therefore, the SCCP layer may have a number of RoutingControlMBeans, with each
on having an association with a single local signalling point.  Consequently,
each routing control function (hence local signalling point) will have its won
SccpTimerProfile.

<li> The SccpSapMBean represents any subsystem.  On its own, the SccpSapMBean
represents a remote subsystem, and is extended by LocalSubSystemMBean to
represent a local subsystem.  Each SccpSapMBean (subsystem) will have a single
Mtp3SapMBean (signalling point) associated with it.

<li> Each routing control may therefore have a number of local
(LocalSubSystemMBean) and remote (SccpSapMBean) subsystems associated with it.

<li> A GlobalTitleEntityMBean will translate to a signle SccpEntitySetMBean.
The SccpEntitySetMBean specifies how traffic is distributed between the two
destination subsystems (SccpSapMBean).

<li> Each SccpSapMBean (subsystem) will have a single concerned area
(ConcernedAreaMBean) associated with it.  The concerned area specifies for a
given subsystem, the set of subsystems to be informed of subsystem status
changes. </ul>
