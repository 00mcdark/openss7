/*
 *  This is a replacement libpcap to permit live capture of SS7 SDUs using ethereal or wireshark.
 *  This library is simply preloaded before loading the ethereal or tethereal and it overrides the
 *  normal pcap functions.  Another alternative is to place the library in a separate load path
 *  under the name libpcap and set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately as invoking ethereal or
 *  wireshark.
 *
 *  There are three levels at which one can capture and 4 points in the SS7 stack: the three levels
 *  are MTP2, MTP3 and SCCP.  The four points of capture are the SDTI (MTP2), SLI (MTP3), MTPI
 *  (MTP3) and SCCPI (SCCP) interfaces.  Not all signallingl links support an MTP2 capture.  For
 *  example, M2PA and M2UA do not support an MTP2 level.  (But these can be captured normally as IP
 *  packets.)  Some drivers, such as the x400p_sl driver, do not support monitoring at the SDTI
 *  (MTP2) level, and only support monitoring at the SLI (MTP3) level.  Other drivers, such as the
 *  x400P_ch driver will support both.  For now, the only supported monitoring point is the
 *  /dev/sl-mon device on the sl-mux driver.  A /dev/cd-mon device on the cd-mux driver will be
 *  available later.
