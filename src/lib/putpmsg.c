  * @param fd a file descriptor representing the Stream.
  * @param ctlptr a pointer to a struct strbuf structure describing the control part of the message.
  * @param datptr a pointer to a struct strbuf structure describing the data part of the message.
  * @param band the band to which to put the message.
  * @param flags the priority of the message.
  *
  * This is the older kernel implementation that uses read()/write() to
  * emulate a system call.  The older kernels do not support ioctl_unlocked()
  * or ioctl_compat() and this was the best way to emulate system calls on
  * older kernels.
  *
  * Under the old approach, a specialized length argument,
  * %LFS_GETMSG_PUTMSG_ULEN was passed to the write(2) system call with a
  * buffer pointer pointing to the argumnets of the putpmsg() call combined
  * into a struct strpmsg structure.  When the Stream head read function
  * recognizes the invalid length argument, it processes the call a putpmsg()
  * instead of write(2).
  *
  * Around Linux kernel 2.6.14, the read()/write() length argument is checked
  * by system code for validity before being passed to the character device
  * driver.  This made this approach no longer workable.  The only advantage
  * of the approach over ioctl() was that ioctl() took the big kernel lock
  * whereas read()/write() did not.  On or about 2.6.14, ioctl_unlocked() was
  * added to the kernel to permit unlocked input-output controls, destroying
  * any advantage that the old approach may have had.
  *
  * One difficulty with the old approach was 32-bit compatibility for 64-bit
  * kernels.  The magic length used by LiS-2.18 was only 32-bits long, whereas
  * the size_t argument is 64-bit on 64-bit calls and 32-bit on 32-bit calls.
  * Linux Fast-STREAMS used a 64-bit magic length which is truncated to 32-bit
  * when a 32-bit call is made to a 64-bit kernel, allowing strread() in the
  * Stream head to distriguish between 32-bit calls and 64-bit calls.  ioctl()
  * is much easier, especially since ioctl_compat() was added to the kernel.
