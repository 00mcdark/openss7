  * @brief Thread-safety implementation file.
  *
  * This file provide implementation of functions used for thread-safety as well
  * as for non-recursive versions of the library.  This file is shared by a
  * number of libraries. */

/** @page threadsafety Discussion on Thread-Safety
  *
  * This is a lightweight pthreads replacement for the non-recursive
  * environment.  This module defines a number of POSIX thread functions that in
  * the implementations of the second set.  are used by library code.  They are
  * defined as weak aliases.  This file provides replacement dummy functions for
  * POSIX thread functions to be used when there is no need for thread-safety.
  * When the libpthread library is loaded against a library containing this
  * package, the POSIX thread definitions from libpthread will be used instead.
  * Both defined and undefined weak symbols are used so that it does not matter
  * whether the libpthread library is loaded before or after the library
  * containing this package.
  *
  * The magic of weak functions is a black art.  This one works currently, don't
  * mess with it.
  *
  * When linked to this object, a library can pretty much use whatever
  * cancellation mechanisms, read-write locks and thread specific data they like
  * using the normal POSIX thread function calls as defined in in <pthread.h>
  * and not worry about non-recursive versions.

/** @name Asynchronous Thread Cancellation Functions
  * @brief Functions for asynchronous thread cancellation.
  *
  * These functions are declared in <pthread.h>, but are also declared here as
  * verification against the system headers.  These symbols are declared as weak
  * undefined symbols in glibc and provide thread safety capabilities to glibc
  * from an add-on pthread library.  They are used in the OpenSS7 libraries to
  * detect whether a suitable pthread library is present (loaded).
  *
  * The set of symbols: pthread_testcancel() and pthread_setcanceltype(), are
  * weak @e defined symbols that are overriden when libpthread loads after
  * glibc.
  *
  * The proper approach in implementation is to implement the set as weak @e
  * defined symbols that override glibc's symbols and are still overridden by
  * libpthread strong symbols, and to test the presence of the first set in the
  * implementations of the second set.
