/*
 * 2.5 Identifying Available PPAs
 *
 * When compiled and run as root, the following program opens the STREAMS
 * device /dev/streams/clone/dlb and prints to the screen the PPAs available on the
 * system.  The PPA number should be passed in using the dl_ppa field of the
 * DL_ATTACH_REQ DLPI primitive.
 *
 * See ndd(1M) for HP-UX, Solaris, etc.  Two input-output controls ND_GET and
 * ND_SET.  These work roughly as illustrate below.  On Linux we would normally
 * use systctl (an /proc or /sys filesystems) for these.
