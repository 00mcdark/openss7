#
# The purpose of this program is to hook into the modprobe.d 'install' and
# 'remove' functions to perform the module loading and unloading actions that
# were formerly provided by initscripts.  This is meant to work with systemd.
# openss7 modules that are placed in the modules-load.d directory for early
# module loading; however, systemd does not provide a good way to perform the
# additional necessary functions (weak-updates, subsytem shutdown) at such an
# early stage in the boot process.  Therefore, we hook the 'install' and
# 'remove' elements for these modules in an openss7.conf file placed in the
# modules.d directory to perform these functions transparent to systemd.
#
# Hook commands are of the form:
#
#   install specfs /usr/sbin/openss7-modprobe specfs $COMMAND_OPTS
#   remove  specfs /usr/sbin/openss7-modprobe -r specfs
#
# This script performs the necessary functions before module load (weak-updates,
# depmod, etc).  Because primary modules are early-loaded (before the
# systemd-sysctld service), application of sysctl's can be performed normally by
# placing the .conf files in sysctl.d.  Also, the specfs.service can mount the
# specfs on /dev/streams.
#
# Before attempting to remove the streams or specfs modules, STREAMS
# applications can be properly shut down and the module stack can be withdrawn.
#
# This openss7-modprobe script can also be used from package install scripts to
# gracefully upgrade the entire STREAMS subsystem.
