/*
 * This is ldterm (line discipline terminal) module.
 *
 * This is just a skeleton, for now.
 */
/*
 * LDTERM Module
 * 
 * The ldterm module is a key part of the STREAMS-based TTY subsystem, supplying the line discipline
 * for terminal devices. This line discipline is POSIX-compliant and also supports the System V and
 * BSD interfaces. The ldterm module provides the terminal interface functions specified in the
 * termios.h header file. The ldterm module also handles EUC and multibyte characters.
 * 
 * The ldterm module processes various types of STREAMS messages, as listed in the [9]Messages
 * Summary. Any other message received by ldterm is passed unchanged, either downstream or upstream.
 */

/*
 * Multibyte Processing
 * 
 * The ldterm module handles the extended UNIX code (EUC) character-encoding scheme. This encoding
 * scheme enables the module to process multibyte characters as well as single-byte characters. It
 * correctly handles backspacing and tabulation expansion for multibyte characters.
 * 
 * By default, multibyte processing by the ldterm module is turned off.  When ldterm receives an
 * EUC_.... IOCTL call that sets character width on screen to a value greater than one, it enables
 * multibyte processing. When multibyte processing is turned on, the ldterm module automatically
 * calls EUC routines as necessary.
 * 
 * Messages Summary for the LDTERM Module
 * 
 * Messages include read-side messages and write-side messages and are listed as follows:
 * 
 * Read-Side Messages 
 * Messages processed by the ldterm module:
 * 
 * + M_BREAK
 * + M_CTL
 * + M_DATA
 * + M_FLUSH
 * + M_HANGUP

 */
/*
 * Read-Side Put Routine
 * 
 * The ldterm read-side put routine processes the following STREAMS messages coming from downstream
 * modules or driver:
 * 
 * M_BREAK 
 *	The ldterm module checks if there are any messages left on its read queue.  If there are
 *	messages, the M_BREAK message gets queued. The M_BREAK message provides the following status
 *	information:
 * 
 *	    break_interrupt parity_error framing_error or overrun
 * 
 * M_CTL 
 *	If the M_CTL message cannot be handled due to memory constraints, this message is queued for
 *	later processing.
 * 
 *	The M_CTL messages received on the read-side and processed by the ldterm module are sent by
 *	the driver for different reasons:
 * 
 *	+   The M_CTL message can be sent to communicate changes in the driver's state. If the
 *	    CLOCAL flag of ldterm is not set, and the carrier state has just made a transition from
 *	    on to off, the read-side put routine sends an M_HANGUP message upstream to inform the
 *	    stream head that the terminal connection was broken.
 *
 *	+   The M_CTL message can be sent to answer to a previous request or command from the ldterm
 *	    module. The following command contained in an M_CTL message is processed:
 * 
 *	    TIOCGETA 
 *		The driver sends this command either as a response to an inquiry for current
 *		settings or to reflect an asynchronous change in the flags of its termios structure.
 * 
 *		The read-side put routine copies the termios structure from the attached M_DATA
 *		message block into its internal termios structure. It then frees the M_CTL message.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * M_DATA 
 *	All M_DATA messages are queued for deferred processing by the service routine.
 * 
 * M_FLUSH 
 *	This is a request to flush the read-side or the write-side queue of all its data messages
 *	and all data being accumulated.  The read-side put routine processes the request and
 *	forwards the message upstream.
 * 
 *	The queue to be flushed (read-side or write-side) is determined by the M_FLUSH parameter
 *	(FLUSHR or FLUSHW ).
 * 
 * M_IOCACK 
 *	If the M_IOCACK messages cannot be handled due to memory constraints, this message is queued
 *	for later processing.
 * 
 *	The M_IOCACK message signals a positive acknowledgment of a previous M_IOCTL message.
 * 
 *	+   If the M_IOCACK message acknowledges the TIOCGETA, TIOCSETA, TIOCSETAW, or TIOCSETAF
 *	    commands,the termios structure is updated as specified in the commands.
 *
 *	+   If the message acknowledges a TIOCOUTQ command, the required number of bytes are added
 *	    to the reply value in the M_IOCACK message.
 *
 *	+   In all other cases, the message is sent upstream.
 * 
 * MC_DO_CANON 
 *	All input processing performed on M_DATA messages is enabled.
 * 
 * MC_NO_CANON 
 *	The input canonical processing normally performed on M_DATA messages is disabled and those
 *	messages are passed upstream unmodified. This is
 *	used by modules or drivers that perform their own input processing (for example, a pseudo
 *	terminal in TIOCREMOTE mode connected to a program that performs the input processing).
 * 
 * MC_PART_CANON 
 *	The driver sends this message to notify the ldterm module that it handles some part of the
 *	input processing itself (for example, flow control). An M_DATA message containing a termios
 *	structure is expected to be attached to the original M_CTL message. The ldterm module will
 *	examine the c_iflag, c_oflag and c_lflag fields of the termios structure and processes only
 *	those flags that have not been turned On.
 * 
 * TCGETX 
 *	The driver sends this message to communicate its termiox structure.
 * 
 * TIOCGETMODEM 
 *	The driver sends this message to communicate the state of its flag modem carrier. The
 *	associated M_DATA message contains a value of 1 (one) to indicate the carrier is on or a
 *	value of 0 (zero) to indicate the carrier is off. This information is used to update the
 *	ldterm module state. If the CLOCAL flag of the ldterm module is not set, and the carrier
 *	state has just made a transition from on to off, the read-side put routine sends an M_HANGUP
 *	message upstream to inform the stream head that the terminal connection was broken.
 * 
 * TIOCSETA 
 *	The driver sends this message to communicate its termios structure.
 * 
 * TIOCSWINSZ 
 *	The driver sends this message to communicate its window size.
 * 
 * TXSETIHOG 
 *	The driver generates these messages to change the IHOG settings.
 * 
 * TXSETOHOG 
 *	The driver generates these messages to change the OHOG settings.
 * 
 * TXTTYNAME 
 *	The driver sends this message to communicate its TTY name.
 * 
 *	When the command is processed, the M_CTL message is freed.
 * 
 * The M_CTL message can be sent to answer to the TIOC_REQUEST coming from the tioc module with a
 * TIOC_REPLY. This M_CTL message is forwarded upstream.
 * 
 * All other messages are forwarded upstream. These include the following:
 * 
 * M_LETSPLAY 
 *	This is a high priority message sent by a lower module or driver to register direct I/O
 *	entry points with the stream head. An integer pointer is included in this message. The
 *	ldterm module increments this integer if it permits direct I/O processing. This message
 *	should be passed upstream to the stream head.
 * 
 * M_HANGUP 
 *	A driver can put the stream in hangup mode by sending this message.  Upon receiving this
 *	message, the ldterm module sets the stream to return errors on writes, putmsg, and ioctls,
 *	with errno set to EIO or ENXIO.

/*
 * Read-Side Service Routing: Delayed Processing
 * 
 * The read-side service routine processes messages that can be delayed due to STREAMS flow control
 * or to ioctls requiring sequential processing. The read-side service routing is called by the
 * scheduler and processes the following commands:
 * 
 * M_BREAK 
 *	See [10]M_BREAK message in Read-Side Put Routine processing.
 * 
 * M_DATA 
 *	The read-side service routine processes the M_DATA messages and performs various actions
 *	according to the character found in the data and the setting of the termios flags:
 * 
 *	+   The read-side put routine generates echo characters, which are sent downstream in M_DATA
 *	    messages.
 *
 *	+   The ldterm module can control the output flow of data. If the IXON flag is set and if
 *	    the ldterm module deals with the flow control, the read-side put routine processes START
 *	    (VSTART) and STOP (V_STOP) characters and sends M_START and M_STOP messages downstream.
 *
 *	+   The ldterm module can control the input flow of data. If the IXOFF flag is set and input
 *	    is to be stopped or started, the read-side put routine generates M_STOPI and M_STARTI
 *	    messages downstream.
 *
 *	+   If the ISIG flag is active, the read-side put routine manages signal characters. It
 *	    sends MPCSIG messages upstream when signal characters are encountered and then discards
 *	    these characters.
 *
 *	+   At the logical termination of input, and if a read request is outstanding, the read-side
 *	    put routine sends the currently buffered characters upstream to the stream head. The
 *	    logical termination characters are NEWLINE, EOF, EOL, and EOL2. If the ICANON flag is
 *	    not set, the ldterm module is in noncanonical or raw input mode. In this case, the input
 *	    terminates when at least VMIN bytes are present in the input message buffer or when the
 *	    timer specified by VTIME expires.  However, the M_DATA messages are forwarded upstream
 *	    only if a read is outstanding, meaning that an M_READ message has been received from the
 *	    stream head. The M_DATA is sent if the read can be satisfied.
 * 
 * M_IOCACK 
 *	See [11]M_IOCACK message in Read-Side Put Routine processing.
 * 
 * M_CTL 
 *	See [12]M_CTL message in Read-Side Put Routine processing.

 */
/*
 * Write-Side Put Routine: Immediate Processing
 * 
 * The ldterm write-side put routine immediately processes the following STREAMS messages:
 * 
 * M_FLUSH 
 *	The write-side put routine flushes the read-side or the write-side queue and discards any
 *	buffered output data. It then forwards the message downstream. The queue to be flushed
 *	(read-side or write-side) is determined by the M_FLUSH parameter (FLUSHR or FLUSHW).
 * 
 * M_DATA 
 *	If the write-side queue is empty, the write-side put routine processes the M_DATA message.
 *	Else, it queues the M_DATA message to the write-side queue for later processing by the
 *	write-side service routine.
 * 
 * M_IOCTL 
 *	The write-side put routine validates the format of the M_IOCTL message and checks for known
 *	IOCTL command:
 * 
 *	+   If the message format is not valid, it converts the M_IOCTL message into an MIOCNAK
 *	    message,and returns it upstream.
 *
 *	+   If the IOCTL command is not recognized, it forwards the M_IOCTL message downstream for
 *	    processing by other modules.
 *
 *	+   If the IOCTL is recognized, the write-side put routine determines if the command must be
 *	    processed in the correct sequence relative to M_DATA messages. If so, it queues the
 *	    M_IOCTL message to the write-side queue for later processing.The commands that require
 *	    processing in sequence are as follows:
 *
 *               1. TIOCSETAW
 *               2. TIOCSETAF
 *               3. TCSETAW
 *               4. TCSETAF
 *               5. TCSBRK
 *               6. TCSETXW
 *               7. TCSETXF
 *               8. TCSBREAK
 * 
 *	Otherwise, the write-side put routine processes the command immediately.
 * 
 * M_READ 
 *	The M_READ message is sent by the stream head to notify downstream modules when an
 *	application has issued a read request and not enough data is queued at the stream head to
 *	satisfy the request. The message contains the number of characters requested by the
 *	application. If the request can be satisfied, the M_READ message block is transformed into
 *	an M_DATA block with the requested data appended. This message is then forwarded upstream.
 * 
 * M_START, M_STOP, M_STARTI, M_STOPI 
 *	Some IOCTLs commands (TCXONC with one parameter among TCOON, TCOOF, TCION, TCIOF) are issued
 *	by the application to control the flow of data. The blocked data is stored in the module's
 *	queues. To process these IOCTLs, the stream head generates and sends downstream the
 *	following high-priority messages:
 * 
 *           + M_START to restart output of data
 *           + M_STOP to stop output of data
 *           + M_STARTI to restart input of data
 *           + M_STOPI to stop input of data.
 * 
 *	The ldterm write-side put routine updates internal state fields and forwards these messages
 *	downstream.
 * 
 * M_BACKDONE 
 *	This message is one of many messages used when a module or driver tries to register direct
 *	I/O entry points with the stream head. Upon receiving this message, the ldterm module knows
 *	all messages from upstream have been cleared. The ldterm module should send down all queued
 *	data downstream as M_BACKWASH messages, and finally forwarding the M_BACKDONE message
 *	downstream.
 * 
 * M_PCTTY 
 *	High priority message type used for communication between the ldterm module and stream head.
 *	Used by the stream head to inform the ldterm module when an event, such as read or ioctl has
 *	been aborted by user signal (timer or ctrl/c). The ldterm module must remove message block
 *	representing aborted read or ioctl from queue and free it. A pointer to the original message
 *	block that was aborted is included in this message.
 * 
 * M_CTL 
 *	This type of message is for internal communication among the modules and driver in the
 *	stream. The ldterm module does not understand a command; it simply forwards the message
 *	downstream. The following command is processed:
 * 
 *	TIOCSTI 
 *	    Sent from an upperstream character conversion module to simulate a typein command.
