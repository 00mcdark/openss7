    DESCRIPTION
        "MIB Module for SIGTRAN M3UA ASP management.
          
         General containment rules:
          
         -  Each ASP has a number of SG to which it connects.
         -  Each SG consists of one or more SGP
         -  Each ASP communicating with an SG forms an 
            association to each SGP in the SG.
          
         -  Each AS can be treated as similar to an MTP-SAP.
         -  Each ASP can be treated as similar to a signalling 
            point.
         -  Each SGP can be treated by an ASP as similar to a 
            signalling link.
         -  Each SG can be treated by an ASP as similar to a 
            (direct) link set
         -  Each SG grouping can be treated by an ASP as a 
            combined link set
         -  Each ASP can have route sets, route lists and routes 
            which correspond to destinations, combined link sets 
            (SG groupings), and link sets (SGs)
          
         Then, management becomes applying the SS7 MTP 
         management model to these correspondences.  Treat SCTP 
         associations to SGPs like signalling links, SGs liked 
         link sets, SG groupings like combined link sets.  When 
         routing, apply the MTP routing management model.  When 
         generating alarms and collecting statistics, use the 
         MTP model.

    DESCRIPTION
        "MTP Restart timer.
          
         A signalling point X considers that MTP of an 
         inaccessible adjacent signalling point Y is restarting 
         when:
          
         -  the first link in a direct link set is in the 'in 
            service' state at level 2; or
         -  another route becomes available due either to 
            reception of a corresponding TFA, TFR or TRA 
            message, or by the corresponding link set becoming 
            available.
          
         When the first link in a direct link set toward 
         signalling point Y, whose MTP is restarting, is in the 
         'in service' state at level 2, signalling point X 
         starts a timer T21 and takes into account of any TFP, 
         TFA and TFR messages received from signalling point Y.  
         In addition, X takes the following action:
          
         -  If X has the transfer function, when the direct link 
            set is available at level 3, X sends any necessary 
            TFP and TFR message to Y; then
          
         -  X sends a traffic restart allowed message to 
            signalling point Y.
          
         If a signalling point, previously declared to be 
         inacessible, becomes available again before T21 is 
         stopped or expires, a corresponding TFA or TFR message 
         is sent to the signalling point Y whose MTP is 
         restarting.
          
         If a signalling point becomes prohibited or restricted 
         to signalling point X after a TRA message has been sent 
         to X by Y, X stops timer T21.
          
         When T21 is stopped or expires, signalling point X 
         sends an MTP-RESUME primitive concerning Y, and all 
         signalling points made available via Y, to all local 
         MTP Users.  If X has the transfer function, it 
         broadcasts to adjacent available signalling points 
         transfer-allowed and/or tansfer restricted messages 
         concerning Y and all signalling points made accessible 
         by Y.
          
         After the MTP of an adjacent node X has restarted, and 
         if T21 has been started, all routes using X are 
         considered to be available unless corresponding TFP or 
         TFR messages have been received whilst T21 was running.
          
         NOTE: ITU-T T21 is similar to ANSI T28 and T25.

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "9.1. When the first signalling link goes into the in 
         service state at level 2, the restarting signalling 
         point begins taking into account any 
         trasnfer-prohibited, trasnfer-restricted, 
         transfer-allowed, traffic restart-allowed, and traffic 
         restart waiting messages received.  The restarting 
         point starts timer T22 and T26 either when the first 
         signalling link goes in the in service state at level 2 
         or when the first signalling link becomes available at 
         level 3.  When a traffic restart waiting message is 
         received before user traffic is restarted on the 
         link(s) to the point that sent the traffic restart 
         waiting message, timer T25 is started and user traffic 
         is not restarted on that link set until a traffic 
         restart allowed message is received or timer T25 
         expires.
          
         9.3. A signalling point X considers that the MTP of an 
           inaccessible adjacent signalling point Y is 
           restarting when: (1) The first link in a direct link 
           set is in the in service state at level 2, or (2) a 
           route other than a direct link set becomes available, 
           e.g. through receipt of a transfer allowed or 
           transfer restart allowed message or the availability 
           of the corresponding link set.
          
         When the first link in a direct link set toward the 
         restarting signalling point Y goes into the in service 
         state at level 2, signalling point X begins taking into 
         account any traffic restart waiting, traffic restart 
         allowed, transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, and 
         transfer-allowed messages from Y.  Signalling oint X 
         starts timer T28 either when the first link goes into 
         the in service state at level 2 or when the first 
         signalling link becomes available at level 3.  In 
         addition it takes the following actions:
          
         (1) If a TRW message is receive from Y while T28 is 
         running or before it is started, X starts T25.  X stops 
         T28 if it is running.
         (2) If a TRW message is receives from Y while T25 is 
         running, X restarts T25.
         (3) When the first link in a link set to Y becomes 
         available, signalling point X sends to Y a traffic 
         restart allowed message or, if X has the transfer 
         function, a traffic restart wiating mesasge followed by 
         transfer-prohibited (note that all transfer prohibited 
         messages according to 13.2.2(1) must be sent) and 
         transfer-restriced messages and a traffic restart 
         allowed message.
         (4) If a destination becomes prohibited, restricted, or 
         available at X, after X has sent a traffic restart 
         allowed message to Y, X notifies Y of the status change 
         by the normal procedures in Section 13.
         (5) When a traffic restart allowed message has been 
         sent to Y and a traffic restart allowed message has 
         been received from Y, X stops T25 or T28, whichever is 
         running, and restarts traffic on the link set to Y.  X 
         gives MTP-RESUME primitives to users concerning Y and 
         any destinations made accessible via Y.  If X has the 
         transfer function it also broadcasts trasnfer-allowed 
         or transfer-restricted messages concerning the same 
         destinations.
         (6) If T28 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
         to Y as in (5), unless a traffic restart allowed 
         message has not been sent to Y.  In that case, X starts 
         T25 and completes the sending of transfer prohibited 
         and transfer restricted messages, followed by a traffic 
         restart allowed message.  Then, unless a traffic 
         restart waiting message has been received from Y 
         without a subsequent traffic restart allowed message, X 
         stops T25 and restarts traffic on the link set to Y.
          
         (7) If T25 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
         toward Y.  In the abnormal case when X has not 
         completed sending transfer-prohibited and 
         transfer-restricted messages to Y, X completes sending 
         transfer-prohibited messges required by 13.2.2 (1) and 
         sends a traffic restart allowed message before 
         restarting user traffic.
          
         (8) If no traffic restart allowed message has been 
         received from Y when traffic is restarted to Y, timer 
         T9 is started.
          
         When signalling point Y becomes accessible via a route 
         other than a direct link set between X and Y, X sends 
         MTP-RESUME primitives concerning Y to all local MTP 
         users.  In addition, if signalling point X has the 
         transfer function, X sends to Y any required transfer 
         prohibitied and transfer restricted messages concerning 
         Y.

         the node in the network and may be modified by 
         management action.
          
         If the SCTP association fails during the probation 
         period, i.e., before expiration of timer T33A, it is 
         put on suspension.  While in suspension the SCTP 
         association remains in the CLOSED state, automatic 
         restoration procedures to establish the SCTP 
         association are not invoked, and association 
         initialization attempts by the peer are refused.
          
         The suspension time period is controlled by timer T34A, 
         which starts running when SCTP enters the CLOSED state.  
         Automatic SCTP association restoration is initiated on 
         expiry of timer T34."

         The default value for M3UA is 8 seconds (800 
         centiseconds).
          
         Once an association forms, M3UA sends the ASP Up 
         message on the association, starts T1T  and awaits an 
         ASP Up Acknowledgement message.  When an ASP Up 
         Acknolwedgement message is received, T1T is stopped and 
         the round trip time (RTT) is calculated as the duration 
         of time between sending the ASP Up message and 
         receiving the ASP Up Acknowledgement message.  If this 
         RTT is greater than one half off the 
         m3uaAspSgMaxLifeTime setting in this entry, the 
         association is aborted, and SCTP association failure 
         and restoration procedures invoked.
          
         If an ASP Up Acknowledgement message is not forthcoming 
         and T1T expires, a second ASPUP message is sent, and 
         T1T restarted.  If T1T expires for a second time, the 
         SCTP association is aborted and the SCTP assocaition 
         failure and restoration procedures are invoked.
          
         If an ASP Down Acknowledgement message is received 
         while T1T is running, or an Error message indicating 
         'management blocking' is received in response to the 
         initial ASP Up message, T1T is stopped, the association 
         is considered failed, the SCTP association is aborted, 
         and SCTP association failure and restoration procedures 
         invoked.
          
         If an Error message indicating an 'invalid version' is 
         received in response to the ASP Up message, it is 
         considered a permanent failure of the SCTP association, 
         the SCTP assocaition is aborted, and management is 
         informed.  Automatic  restoration procedures are not 
         invoked."

                 to singalling transfer point Z.

            2.   When signalling trasnfer point Y recognizes the 
                 inaccessibility of signalling point X (see 
                 5.3.3 and 7.2.3).  In this case a

                 received at signalling trasnfer point Y and Y 
                 is unable to transfer the message, and if no 
                 corresponding timer T8 is running.  In this 
                 case the transfer-prohibited message is sent to 
                 the adjacent signalling poin from which the 
                 message concerned was received (Response 
                 Method).  In addition, timet T8 is started 
                 concerning SP X.

                 accessible, STP Y sends to Z a transfer 
                 prohibited message concerning destination X, if

         normal route(s) to destination X become unavailable and 
         signalling transfer point Y begins using a lower 
         priority route to destination X, timer T11 is started.  
         When timer T11 expires or the lower priority route 
         experiences danger of congestion (whichever occurs 
         first), signalling transfer point Y notifies accessible 
         adjacent signalling points using one of two possible 
         methods:

         (a) Broadcast Method

         Signalling transfer point Y sends transfer-restricted 
         messages concerning destination X to all accessible 
         adjacent signalling points, except those signalling 
         points that receive a transfer-prohibited message 
         according to 
         13.2.2 (1) and except destination X if it is an 
            adjacent point.  Timer T18 is started after the 
            broadcast is complete.  If the failure is still 
            present and T18 expires, a transfer-restricted 
            message is sent once per incoming link or link set 
            by signalling transfer point Y in response to a 
            message for destination X.

         As a network option, the rate that transfer-restricted 
         messages are broadcast may be regulated to minimize the 
         burst of traffic that can occur due to controlled 
         rerouting in adjacent nodes.  This regulation is not 
         performed for the broadcasting of transfer-restricted 
         messages indicating that a previously isolated 
         destination is accessible.

         point X, the controlled rerouting procedure is used.  
         The traffic being routed on current routes B, C,  D 
         that is normaly routed on route A is directed to a 
         controlled rerouting buffer.  New traffic for route A

         Timer T6 is started.  When timer T6 expires, the 
         controlled rerouting buffer and any new traffic for 
         route A are directed to route A.
          
         This time is the interval, T6, for which messages will
