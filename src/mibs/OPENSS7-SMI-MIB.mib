SpecificProblems ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This parameter, when present, identifies further 
         refinements to the probable cause of the alarm.  This 
         parameter qualifies the chosen probable cause and may 
         be used by the managed object class definer to specify 
         a set of identifiers for use in managed object classes.
         
         This parameter is either a set of integers or a set of 
         object identifiers.  However, only object identifiers 
         shall be used within the system management context 
         defined in ITU-T Rec.  X.701 | ISO/IEC 10040.
         
         This is either an object identifier or an integer.  
         When valued as an integer, the integer is coded in the 
         first and only element of the object identifier.
         When coded as an integer, because of the way that 
         object identifiers are BER encoded, the value will

PerceivedSeverity ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This parameter defines six severity levels that provide 
         an indication of how it is perceived that the 
         capability of the managed object has been affected.  
         Those severity levels that represent service affecting 
         conditions ordered from most sever to lease severe are 
         Critical, Major, Minor and Warning.  The levels defined 
         for use with this mandatory parameter of alarm 
         notifications are:
         
          - cleared: The Cleared severity level indicates the 
            clearing of one or more previously reported alarms.  
            This alarm clears all alarms for this managed object 
            that have the same Alarm type, Probable cause and 
            Specific problems (if given).  Multiple associated 
            notifications may be cleared by using the Correlated 
            notifications parameter (defined below).  ITU-T Rec.  
            X.733 | ISO/IEC 10164-2 does not require that the 
            clearing of previously reported alarms be reported.  
            Therefore, a managing system cannot assume that the 
            absence of an alarm with the Cleared severity level 
            means that the condition that caused the generation 
            of previous alarms is still present. Managed object 
            definers shall state if, and under which conditions, 
            the Cleared severity level is used.
         
          - indeterminate: The Indeterminate severity level 
            indicates that the severity level cannot be 
            determined.
         
          - critical: The Critical severity level indicates that 
            a service affecting condition has occurred and an 
            immediate corrective action is required. Such 
            a severity can be reported, for example, when 
            a managed object becomes totally out of service and 
            its capability must be restored.
         
          - major: The Major severity level indicates that 
            a service affecting condition has developed and an 
            urgent corrective action is required. Such 
            a severity can be reported, for example, when there 
            is a severe degradation in the capability of the 
            managed object and its full capability must be 
            restored.
         
          - minor: The Minor severity level indicates the 
            existence of a non-service affecting fault condition 
            and that corrective action should be taken in order 
            to prevent a more serious (for example, service 
            affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, 
            for example, when the detected alarm condition is 
            not currently degrading the capacity of the managed 
            object.
         
          - warning: The Warning severity level indicates the 
            detection of a potential or impending service 
            affecting fault, before any significant effects have 
            been felt. Action should be taken to further 
            diagnose (if necessary) and correct the problem to 
            prevent it from becoming a more serious service 
            affecting fault.
         
         This is the perceived severity of an alarm defined in 
         accordance with the definitions in the OSI SMI.  When 
         it appears within a scalar defined for use in 
         a notification, it represents the severity of the 
         notification.  Under OSI SMI, the perceived severity is 
         used to indicate both the onset of an alarm condition 
         and the clearing of an alarm condition.
         
         When set to any value other than cleared(5), the 
         notification represents the onset of the alarm 
         corresponding to the notification with a severity level 
         indicated by the value.  Normal telecommunications 
         warning, minor, major, critical alarm indications can 
         be indicated.  (Note that the setting of 
         indeterminate(0) is only applied when none of the other 
         characterizations will suffice.)
         
         When set to to cleared(5), the notification represents 
         the clearing of the alarm condition corresponding to 
         the notification."

TrendIndication ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This parameter, when present, specifies the current 
         severity trend of the managed object. If present it 
         indicates that there are one or more alarms 
         ('outstanding alarms') which have not been cleared, and 
         pertain to the same managed object as that to which 
         this alarm ('current alarm') pertains. The Trend 
         indication parameter has three possible values:
         
          - more severe: The Perceived severity in the current 
            alarm is higher (more severe) than that reported in 
            any of the outstanding alarms;
         
          - no change: The Perceived severity reported in the 
            current alarm is the same as the highest (most 
            severe) of any of the outstanding alarms;
           
          - less severe: There is at least one outstanding alarm 
            of a severity higher (more severe) than that in the 
            current alarm.
         
         For Trend indication to be meaningful, the Perceived 
         severity parameter value of each alarm that may be 
         emitted by the managed object must be defined 
         consistently over all of the defined alarm types for 
         that managed object class. Trend indication information 
         is of particular use to managing systems which receive 
         alarm reports from an event forwarding discriminator 
         configured to pass alarms above a Perceived severity 
         level. The severity trend can also be determined by 
         a managing system that monitors the Perceived severity 
         parameter in received alarm reports.
         
         The Trend indication parameter shall not be present if 
         there are no outstanding alarms.
         
         The absence of the Trend indication parameter cannot be 
         taken to indicate the existence or non-existence of 
         outstanding alarms."

ThresholdInfo ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This parameter shall be present when the alarm is 
         a result of crossing a threshold. It consists of four 
         subparameters.
         
          - triggered threshold: The identifier of the threshold 
            attribute that caused the notification;
         
          - threshold level: In the case of a gauge the 
            threshold level specifies a pair of threshold 
            values, the first being the value of the crossed 
            threshold and the second, its corresponding 
            hysteresis; in the case of a counter the threshold 
            level specifies only the threshold value.
         
          - observed value: The value of the gauge or counter 
            which crossed the threshold. This may be different 
            from the threshold value if, for example, the gauge 
            may only take on discrete values.
         
          - arm time: For a gauge threshold, the time at which 
            the threshold was last re-armed, namely the time 
            after the previous threshold crossing at which the 
            hysteresis value of the threshold was exceeded thus 
            again permitting generation of notifications when 
            the threshold is crossed. For a counter threshold, 
            the later of the time at which the threshold offset 
            was last applied, or the time at which the counter 
            was last initialized (for resettable counters)."

         a conceptual table it refers to the administrative 
         state of the object represented by the row.
         
         The admninistrative state textual convention is single 
         valued and read-write.  It can have one of the

            from performing services for its users.
         
          - unlocked: The resource is administratively permitted 
            to perform services for its users.  This is 
            independent of its inherent operability.
         
          - shutting down: Use of the resource is 
            administratively permitted to existing instances of 
            use only.  While the system remains in the shutting 
            down state, the manager may at any time cause the 
            managed object to revert to the unlocked state.
         
         Precise definition of the states is specific to the 
         managed object represented.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this 
         textual convention is given an MAX-ACCESS of read-write 
         or read-create, permitting management stations the 
         ability to set the value.
         
         Values that can be set are locked(0), unlocked(1) or 
         shuttingDown(2).  The actions performed when set to 
         locked(0), unlocked(1) or shuttingDown(2) will be 
         described specifically in the DESCRIPTION section for 
         the object. however, in general, setting the object to 
         locked(0) results in immediate and disruptive 
         withdrawal from service of the object represented by 
         the row and all contained objects.  Setting the object 
         to shuttingDown(2) results in the graceful withdrawal 
         from service of the object represented by the row and 
         all contained objects.  Setting the object to 
         unlocked(1) results in placing back into service the 
         represented object and all contained objects that do 
         not have an administrative state of their own, or that 
         have an administrative state which is also unlocked(1).
         
         The default value associated with this row is locked(0) 
         and the managed object represented by the conceptual 
         row is created in the administratively locked state.
         
         Precise defintions of both the conditions when the 
         state is fetched and the conditions when the state is 
         set must appear in the DESCRIPTION of the object type 
         definition using this textual convention."

          - alarm outstanding: One or more alarms have been 
            detected in the resource, the condition of which may 
            or may not be disabling.  If the operational state 
            is enabled, additional attributes, particular to the 
            managed object class, may indicate the nature and 
            cause of the condition and the services that are 
            affected.
         
         The presence of the above alarm state conditions do not 
         suppress the generation of future fault related 
         notifications.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this 
         textual convention is given a MAX-ACCESS of read-write

GnmAlarmStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention represents the alarm status 
         according to ITU-T Rec. M.3100 which is different from 
         that of ITU-T Rec.  X.721 and X.733.  When it appears 
         within a row in a conceptual table, it refers to the 
         alarm status of the managed object represented by the 
         row.  Rows in conceptual tables representing managed 
         objects that may generate alarms should contain this 
         textual convention (or that of X.721, the AlarmStatus).
         
         The alarm status textual convention is single-valued 
         and read-only.  It can have one of the following 
         values, not all of which are applicable to every class 
         of managed object.
         
         In order of severity from most severe to least severe:
         
         - activeReportableCritical(5), one or more active and 
           reportable critical alarms indicating a fault have 
           been detected;
         
         - activeReportableMajor(4), one or more active and 
           reportable major alarms indicating a fault have been 
           detected;
         
         - activeReportableMinor(3), one or more active and 
           reportable minor alarms have been detected;
         
         - activeReportableIndeterminate(1), one or more active 
           and reportable alarms of indeterminate severity have 
           been detected;
         
         - activeReportableWarning(2), one or more active and 
           reportable warning alarms have been detected;
         
         - activePending(6), one ore more activate but pending 
           alarms (either pending severity assignment or pending 
           reporting) have been detected;
         
         - cleared(0), no active alarms have been detected that 
           have not been cleared.
         
         The value of the alarm state condition does not 
         suppress the generation of future fault related 
         notifications.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this 
         textual convention is given a MAX-ACCESS of read-only.
         
         The default value associated with this row is 
         cleared(0) and the managed object created by the 
         conceptual row is created wtihout active alarms.
         
         Precise defintions of which values are applicable must 
         appear in the DESCRIPTION clause of the object type

ProceduralStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This is the procedural status of an Entry in accodance 
         with the definitions in ITU-T Recommendation X.731 
         (1992).  Under X.731 the syntax of a ProceduralStatus 
         is a SET OF INTEGER with these defined values, however, 
         SNMP can't do that, so we use BITS instead.  When it 
         appears in an entry in a conceptual table, this textual 
         convention refers to the procedural or active status of 
         the managed object represented by the entry.
         
         The procedural status textual convention is supported 
         only by those managed objects that represent some 
         procedure (e.g, a test process) which progresses 
         through a sequence of phases.  Depending upon the 
         managed object class definition, the procedure may be 
         required to reach certain phase for the resource to be 
         operational and available for use (i.e, for the managed 
         object to be enabled).  Not all phases may be 
         applicable to every class of managed object.  If the 
         value of this textual convention is an emtpy set, the 
         managed object is ready, for example, the 
         initialization is complete.
         
          - intialization required: The resource requires 
            initialization to be invoked by the manager before 
            it can perform its normal functions, and this 
            procedure has not been initiated.  The manager may 
            be able to invoke such initialization through an 
            action.  The terminating condition may also be 
            present.  The operational state is disabled.
         
          - not initialized: The resource requires 
            initialization before it can perform its normal 
            functions, and this procedure has not been 
            initiated.  The resource initializes itself 
            autonomously, but the operational state may be 
            either disabled or enabled, depending upon the 
            managed object class definition.
         
          - initializing: The resource requires initialization 
            before it can perform its normal functions, and this 
            procedure has been initiated but is not yet 
            complete.  When this condition is present, the 
            intitialization required condition is absent, since 
            initialization has already begun.  The operational 
            state may be disabled or enabled, depending upon the 
            managed object class defintion.
         
          - terminating: The resource is in a termination phase.  
            If the resource does not reinitialize itself 
            autonomously, the initialization required condition 
            is also present and the operational state is 
            disabled; otherwise, the operational state may be 
            either disabled or enabled, depending upon the 
            managed object class definition.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this 
         textual convention is given a MAX-ACCESS of read-only, 
         permitting management station to ability to fetch the 
         value.
         
         The default value associated with this row is the empty 
         set ('00000'B) and the managed object created by the 
         conceptual row is created in the functional state.
         
         Precise definition of the status is specific to the 
         managed object represented.  Not all status members are 
         applicable to all managed objects.  Precise definitions 
         of which members are applicable and what conditions 
         exist for each applicable member of the state must

AvailabilityStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This is the availability status of an Entry in 
         accordance with the definitions in the OSI SMI.  When 
         it appears within a conceptual row it refers to the 
         availability status of the manage objected represented 
         by the conceptual row.
         
         The availability status textual convention is 
         set-valued and read-only.  It can have zero or more of 
         the following values, not all of which are applicable 
         to every class of managed object.  When the value of 
         this attribute is empty, this implies that none of the 
         status conditions described below are present.
         
          - in test: The resource is undergoing a test 
            procedure.  If the administrative state is locked or 
            shutting down then normal users are precluded from 
            using the resource and the control status attribute 
            has the value reserved for test.  Tests that do not 
            exclude additional users can be present in any 
            operational or administrative state but the reserved 
            for test condition should not be present.
         
          - failed: The resource has an internal fault that 
            prevents it from operating.  The operational state 
            is disabled.
         
          - power off: The resource requires power to be applied 
            and is not powered on.  For example, a fuse or other 
            protection device is known to have removed power or 
            a low voltage condition has been detected.  The 
            operational state is disabled.
         
          - offline: The resource requires a routing operation 
            to be performed to place it online and make it 
            available for use.  The operation may be manual or 
            automatic, or both.  The operational state is 
            disabled.
         
          - off duty: The resource has been made inactive by an 
            internal control process in accordance with 
            a predetermined time schedule.  Under normal 
            conditions the control process can be expected to 
            reactivate the resource at some scheduled time, and 
            it is therefore considered to be optional.  The 
            operational state is enabled or disabled.
         
          - dependency: The resource cannot operate because some 
            other resource on which it depends is (i.e, 
            a resource not represented by the same managed 
            object) unavailable.  For example, a device is not 
            accessible because its controller is powered off.  
            The operational state is disabled.
         
          - degraded: The service available from the resource is 
            degraded in some respect, such as in speed or 
            operating capacity.  Failure of a test or an 
            unacceptable performance measurement has established 
            that some or all services are not functional or are 
            degraded due to presence of a defect.  However, the 
            resource remains available for service, either 
            because some services are satisfactory or because 
            degraded service is preferable to no service at all.  
            Object specific attributes may be deinfed to 
            represent further information indicating, for 
            example, which serivces are not functional and the 
            nature of the degradation.  The operational state is 
            enabled.
         
          - not installed: The resource represented by the 
            managed object is not present, or is incomplete.  
            For example, a plug-in module is missing, a cable is 
            disconnected or a software module is not loaded.  
            The operational state is disabled.
         
          - log full: This indicates a log full condition the 
            semantics of which are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.735.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this 
         textual convention is given a MAX-ACCESS of read-only, 
         permitting management stations the ability to retrieve 
         the value only.
         
         The default value associated with this row is the empty 
         set ('000000000'B) and the managed object created by 
         the conceptual row is created is an available state.
         
         Precise definition of the states is specific to the 
         managed object represented.  Not all states are 
         applicable to all managed objects.  Precise definitions 
         of which states are applicable and what conditions

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention represents the control status 
         of an managed object in accordance with the definitions 
         in ITU-T Recommendation X.731 (1992).  When it appears 
         within a row of a coneceptual table, it refers to the 
         control status of the managed object represented by the 
         row.
         
         The control status textual convention is read-write and 
         set-valued.  It can have zero or more of the following 
         values, not all of which are applicable to every class 
         of managed object.  When the value of this textual 
         convention is empty, this implies that none of the 
         status conditions described below are present.
         
          - subject to test: The resource is available to normal 
            users, but tests may be conducted on it 
            simultaneously at unpredicatble times, which may 
            cause it to exhibit unusual characteristics to 
            users.
         
          - part of services locked: This value indicates 
            whether a manager has administratively restricted 
            a particular part of a service from the user(s) of 
            a resource.  The administrative state is unlocked.  
            Examples are incoming service barred, outgoing 
            service barred, write locked by media key, read 
            locked.
         
          - reserved for test: The resource has been made 
            administratively unavailable to normal users because 
            it is undergoing a test procedure.  The 
            administrative state is locked.
         
          - suspended: Service has been administratively 
            suspended to the users of the resource.  The 
            resource may retain knowledge of current users 
            and/or requests for usage, depending upon the 
            managed object class definition, but does not resume 
            performing serivces until the suspended condition is 
            revoked.  The administrative state is unlocked.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention represents the standby status 
         of an Entry in accordance with the defintions in ITU-T 
         Recommendation X.731 (1992).  When it appears within 
         a row of a conceptual table it refers to the standby 
         status of the managed object represented by the row.
         
         The standby status textual convention is single-valued 
         and read-only.  It shall have one of the following 
         values.  The value is only meaningful when the back-up 
         relationship role exists.
         
          - hot standby: The resource is not providing service, 
            but is operating in synchronism with another 
            resource that is to be backed-up (e.g, a computer 
            shadowing another computer).  A resource with a hot 
            standby status will be immediately able to take over 
            the role of the resource to be backed-up, without 
            the need for intialization activity, and will 
            contain the same information as the resource being 
            backed up.  The hot standby condition is mutually 
            exclusive with the cold standby and providing 
            service conditions.  The operational state is 
            enabled.  The administrative state is unlocked.  The 
            availability status is offline.
         
          - cold standby: The resource is to back-up another 
            resource, but is not syncrhonized with that 
            resource.  A resource with a cold standby status 
            will not be immediately able to take over the role 
            of a resource to be backed up, and will require some 
            initialization activity.  The cold standby condition 
            is mutually exclusive with the hot standby and 
            providing service condition.  The operational state 
            is enabled or disabled.  The administrative state is 
            locked or unlocked.  The procedural status contains 
            not initialized or initialization required.  The 
            availability status is offline.
         
          - providing service: The back-up resource is providing 
            service and is backing up another resource.  The 
            providing service condition is mutually exclusive 
            with the hot stanbdy and cold standby conditions.

         violation, security service or mechanism violation, and 
         time domain violation notifications.  It contains an 
         object identity which indicates the cause of the alarm 
         in accordance with SecurityAlarmCause textual 
         convention.
         
         The meaning and purpose of object identifiers that are 
         used to populate this parameter for these alarm

         defined in the DESCRIPTION clause whenever the value is 
         used to raise generic alarms such as the integrity 
         violation.  When used with a specific notification, the 
         use of the security alarm cause parameter must be 
         defined in the NOTIFICATION-TYPE marco's DESCRIPTION 
         clause.
         
         In all cases, the object identifier defined by the 
         corresponding standard (i.e.  TMN specification) should 
         be used as specified in the corresponding standard.

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This notification type is used to report when the 
         object detects a communications error.
         
         This is one of two mechanisms of providing 
         communications alarms corresponding to TMN alarms.  One 
         method is to provide a single notification which is 
         parameterized in a similar fashion to TMN.  The other 
         method is providing indepdendent notifications for each 
         cause.  The advantages of providing a single 
         notification for communications alarms is that the 
         management station need only monitor a single trap to 
         receive all alarm indications.  On a managed system 
         with thousands of unique alarms, this has scale 
         benefits.
         
         The communicationsAlarm is modelled on the TMN 
         notification of the same name.  TMN too has the ability 
         to provide independent notifications and chose 
         a similar unified alarm notification.
         
         The first parameter of the communicationsAlarm is the 
         probable cause, which is an object identifier defined 
         with the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro.  The probable cause 
         identifies the alarm.  The third parameter (second 
         object in SNMP) is the perceived severity.  Following 
         the PerceivedSeverity textual convention, this 
         parameter indicates when the alarm has onset or 
         cleared, and when indicating onset, the relative 
         severity in telecommunications terms (warning, minor, 
         major, critical).  The second parameter (optional 
         additional object in SNMP) is a sequence of specific 
         problems that refined the alarm indication.
         
         Because their values are defined by an OBJECT-IDENTITY 
         macro, the DESCRIPTION clause in that macro defining 
         a probable cause or specific problem should clearly 
         identify the purpose of the alarm, when it is 
         generated, when it is cleared, and how a specific 
         problem refines the probable cause.  This makes this 
         information available to managers via the MIB 
         generating the alarms.  Where a generic value is not 
         used, the probable cause and specific problems should 
         be defined within the MIB module that use them.
         
         State changes and attribute value changes can be 
         reported by simply including the object with the old 
         value and the object with the new value for each object 
         reported."

        "This notification may be used to report the occurrence

         a managed object.  These are informational events; 
         important enough to report, but not requiring any 
         further action by a manager.  Faults and abnormal 
         conditions (which may require manager action) shall be 
         reported using the event types defined in CCITT Rec.  
         X.733 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10164-4:1992.
         
         The communicationsInformation notification is modelled 
         on the TMN notification of the same name.
         
         The first paraemter of the communicationInformation 
         notification is the information type, which is an 
         object identifier defined with the OBJECT-IDENTITY 
         macro.  The information type identifies the event.
         
         Beacuse its value is defined by an OBJECT-IDENTITY 
         macro, the DESCRIPTION clause in that macro defining an 
         information type should clearly identify the purpose of 
         the event notification, when it is geenrtated, ahd how 
         any information data refines the information type.  
         This makes this information available to managers via 
         the MIB generating the alarms.  When a generic value is 
         not used, the information type should be defined within 
         the MIB module that issues them."
