    DESCRIPTION
        "This scalar defines, for GCP, the default time interval (in

         a value of 1 millisecond or greater.
         
         In general this value determines the amount of time that it 
         takes for an SCTP association to detect a failure on 
         a association which has no data to transmit or retransmit.
         
         M2PA, however, is used by MTP Level 3 which generates a test 
         message every T2, where T2 is defined in ITU-T Rec. Q.707 
         (1993) or ANSI T1.111.7 (2000) to have a range from 4 to 12 
         seconds.  Therefore, for M2PA, unless the SCTP heartbeat 
         interval is set below Q.707-T2, it will only have effect on 
         multi-homed associations for checking the status of non-primary 
         or non-CMT destinations.
         
         Reducing this value will reduce the amount of time taken to 
         detect primary and non-primary, non-CMT path, interface and 
         destination failures, but may only affect primary destinations 
         if reduced below the corresponding Q.707-T2 value.
         
         The default default value is that recommended by RFC 4960 (6000

           normal users are precluded from using the resource and the 
           control status attribute has the value reserved for test.  
           Tests that do not exclude additional users can be present in 
           any operational or administrative state but the reserved for 
           test condition should not be present.
           
         - failed(1), the Media Gateway has an internal fault that 
           prevents it from operating.  The operational state is 
           disabled.
           
         - powerOff(2), the Media Gateway requires power to be applied 
           and is not powered on.  For example, a fuse or other 
           protection device is known to have removed power or a low 
           voltage condition has been detected.  The operational state 
           is disabled.
           
         - offLine(3), the Media Gateway requires a routing operation to 
           be performed to place it online and make it available for 
           use.  The operation may be manual or automatic or both.  The 
           operational state is disabled.
           
         - offDuty(4), the Media Gateway has been made inactive by an 
           internal control process in accordance with a predetermined 
           time schedule.  Under normal conditions the control process 
           can be expected to reactivate the Media Gateway at some 
           scheduled time, and it is therefore considered to be 
           optional.  The operational state is either enabled or 
           disabled.
           
         - dependency(5), the Media Gateway cannot operate because some 
           other resource on which it depends is (i.e, a resource not 
           represented by the same managed object) unavailable.  For 
           example, a device is not accessible because its controller is 
           powered off.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - degraded(6), the service available from the Media Gateway is 
           degraded in some respect, such as in speed or operating 
           capacity.  Failure of a test or an unacceptable performance 
           measurement has established that some or all services are not 
           functional or are degraded due to the presence of a defect.  
           However, the Media Gateway remains available for service, 
           either because some services are satisfactory or because 
           degraded service is preferable to no service at all.  The 
           operational state is enabled.
           
         - notInstalled(7), the managed object representing the Media 
           Gateway is not present, or is incomplete.  For example, 
           a plug-in module is missing, a cable is disconnected or 
           a software module is not loaded.  The operational state is 
           disabled.
           
         - logFull(8), this indicates a log full condition, the 
           semantics of which are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.735.

         conditions:
         
         - initializationRequired(0), the MG requires initialization to 
           be invoked by the manager before it can perform its normal 
           functions, and this procedure has not been initiated.  The 
           management may be able to invoke such a initialization

           operational state is disabled.
           
         - initializing(2), the MG requires initialization before it can 
           perform its normal functions, and this procedure has been 
           initiated, but is not yet complete.  When this condition is 
           present, the initializationRequred(0) and notInitialized(1) 
           conditions are absent.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - reporting(3), the MG has failed and is reporting failure.
           
         - terminating(4), the MG is in a termination phase.  If the MG 
           does not reinitialize itself autonomously, the 
           intializationRequired(0) condition is also present and the

           resource.  A Media Gateway with a cold standby status will 
           not immediately be able to take over the role of a resource

           users can be present in any operational or administrative 
           state but the reserved for test condition should not be 
           present.
           
         - failed(1), the Media Gateway Controller has an internal fault 
           that prevents it from operating.  The operational state is 
           disabled.
           
         - powerOff(2), the Media Gateway Controller requires power to 
           be applied and is not powered on.  The operational state is 
           disabled.
           
         - offLine(3), the Media Gateway Controller requires a routing 
           operation to be performed to place it online and make it

           inactive by an internal control process in accordance with 
           a predetermined time schedule.  Under normal conditions the 
           control process can be expected to reactivate the Media

           therefore considered to be optional.  The operational state 
           is either enabled or disable.

           because some other resource on which it depends is 
           unavailable.  The operational state is disabled.

           Controller is degraded in some respect, such as in speed or 
           operating capacity.  Failure of a test or an unacceptable 
           performance measurement has established that some or all 
           services are not functional or are degraded due to the 
           presence of a defect.  However, the Media Gateway Controller 
           remains available for service, either because some services 
           are satisfactory or because degraded service is preferable to 
           no service at all.  The operational state is enabled.
           
         - notInstalled(7), the Media Gateway Controller is not present, 
           or is incomplete.  The operational state is disabled.

         in accordance with the ProceduralStatus textual convention of 
         the OPENSS7-SMI-MIB and ITU-T Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2.  
         The procedural status can report any set of the following 
         conditions:
         
         - initializationRequired(0), the MGC requires initialization to 
           be invoked by the manager before it can perform its normal 
           functions, and this procedure has not been initiated.  The 
           management may be able to invoke such an initialization 
           through an action.  The terminating(4) condition may also be 
           present.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - notInitialized(1), the MGC requires initialization before it 
           can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not 
           been initiated.  The MGC initializes itself autonomously.  
           The operational state is disabled.

         - initializing(2), the MGC requires initialization before it can 
           perform its normal functions, and this procedure has been 
           initiated, but is not yet complete.  When this condition is 
           present, the initializationRequired(0) and notInitialized(1) 
           conditions are absent, since initialization has already 
           begun.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - reporting(3), the MGC has failed and is reporting failure.
           
         - terminating(4), the MGC is in a termination phase.  If the 
           MGC does not reinitialize itself autonomously, the 
           initializationRequired(0) condition is also present and the 
           operational state is disabled; otherwise, the operational 
           state is disabled.
           
         Note that when the MGC in question is remote to the managed 
         system, this is the view of the procedural status of the remote 
         MGC as discerned by the managed system and depends on the 
         procedural status of the communications linkage to the MGC."

           with a cold standby status will not immediately be able to 
           take over the role of the MGC to be backed up, and will 
           require some initialization activity.  The operational state 
           is enabled(0) or disabled(1); the administrative state is 
           locked(0) or unlocked(1); the procedural status contains 
           notInitialized(1) or initializationRequired(0); availability 
           status is offLine(3).

           is backing up another MGC (on a different host).  The 
           administrative state is unlocked(1); availability status is 
           online.
           
         This status is only meaningful when gcpMgcPg is non-zero: that 
         is, the MGC belongs to a protection group.  When the gcpMgcPg

           disabled.
           
         - offLine(3), the communications linkage requires a routing 
           operation to be performed to place it online and make it 
           available for use.  The operation may be manual or automatic 
           or both.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - offDuty(4), the communications linkage has been made inactive 
           by an internal control process in accordance with 
           a predetermined time schedule.  Under normal conditions the 
           control process can be expected to reactivate the linkage at 
           some scheduled time, and it is therefore considered to be 
           optional.  The operational state is either enabled or 
           disabled.
           
         - dependency(5), the communications linkage cannot operate 
           because some other resource on which it depends is 
           unavailable.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - degraded(6), the communications linkage is degraded in some 
           respect, such as in speed or operating capacity.  Failure of 
           a test or an unacceptable performance measurement has 
           established that some or all services are not functional or 
           are degraded due to the presence of a defect.  However, the 
           linkage remains available for service, either because some 
           services are satisfactory or because degraded service is 
           preferable to no service at all.  The operational state is 
           enabled.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This column determines whether keep-alive messages used to 
         probe the destination transport address will be sent 
         periodically.  The default default value is the value 
         recommended by RFC 793, which is false(2).
         
         When true(1), a keep-alive timer is activated to monitor idle 
         connections that might no longer exist.  If a connection has 
         been idle since the last keep-alive timeout, a keep-alive 
         packet is sent to check if the connection is still alive or 
         broken.
         
         Keep-alive packets are not an explicit feature of TCP, and this 
         practise is not universally accepted.  According to RFC 1122 
         ``a keep-alive mechanism should only be invoked in service 
         applications that might otherwise hang indefinitely and consume 
         resources unnecessarily if a client crashes or aborts 
         a connection during a network failure.''
         
         Enabling keep-alive increases the protocol's responsiveness in 
         detection of failure and redirection of traffic away from 
         failed paths and interfaces.  However, TCP connections are far 
         less robust on noisy or congested links with keep-alive 
         enabled.  This column should normally be left at its default 
         value.
