        "The Managed Switching Element represents, for 
         management purposes, an exchange, i.e. the aggregate of

         and signalling means at a network node that enables 
         subscriber lines to be interconnected and packets to be 
         forwarded as required by individual users.
         
         The Managed Element object class is a class of managed 
         objects representing telecommunications equipment or 
         TMN entities (either groups or parts) within the 
         telecommunications network that performs managed 
         element functions, i.e.  provides support and/or 
         service to the subscriber. Managed elements may or may 
         not additionally perform mediation/OS functions. 
         A managed element communicates with the manager 
         (directly or indirectly) over one or more standard 
         Q-interfaces for the purpose of being monitored and/or 
         controlled. A managed element contains equipment that 
         may or may not be geographically distributed.  When the

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This table lists all of the Media Gateway devices known to this 
         managed system.  When the management view is that of a managed 
         system containing Media Gateway Controllers, this table 
         characterizes all of the MG with which a Media Gateway 
         Controller in the managed system might communicate or 
         reference.  When the management view is that of a managed 
         system containing Media Gateways, this table characterizes all 
         of the MG in the managed system as well as all of the MG that 
         might be backing up an MG within the managed system, or that an 
         MG within the managed system might be backing up.
         
         A physical Media Gateway may be partitioned into one or more 
         Virtual MGs (VMGs).  A Virtual MG consists of a set of 
         statically partitioned physical terminations and/or sets of 
         ephemeral terminations.  A physical termination is controlled by 
         one MGC.  The model does not require that other resources be 
         statically allocated, just terminations.  The mechanism for 
         allocating terminations to Virtual MGs is managed by this MIB.  
         Each of the virtual MGs appears to the MGC as a complete MG 
         client.
         
         A physical MG may have only one network interface, which must be 
         shared across virtual MGs.  In such a case, the packet/cell side 
         termination is shared.  It should be noted, however, that in 
         use, such interfaces require an ephemeral instance of the 
         termination to be created per flow, and thus sharing the 
         termination is straightforward.  This mechanism does lead to 
         a complication, namely that the MG must always know which of its 
         controlling MGCs should be notified if an event occurs on the 
         interface.
         
         In normal operation, the virtual MG will be instructed by the 
         MGC to create network flows (if it is the originating side), or 
         to expect flow requests (if it is the terminating side), and no 
         confusion will arise.  However, if an unexpected event occurs, 
         the virtual MG must know what to do with respect to the physical 
         resources it is controlling.
         
         If recovering from the event requires manipulation of a physical 
         interface's state, only one MGC should do so.  These issues are 
         resolved by allowing any of the MGCs to create Event Descriptors 
         to be notified of such events, but only one MGC can have 
         read/write access to the physical interface properties; all 
         other MGCs have read-only access.  The management mechanism is 
         used to designate which MGC has read/write capability, and is 
         designated the Master MGC.
         
         Each virtual MG has its own Root Termination.  In most cases, 
         the values for the properties of the Root Termination are 
         independently settable by each MGC.  Where there can only be one 
         value, the parameter is read-only to all but the Master MGC.
         
         ServiceChange may only be applied to a termination or set of 
         terminations partitioned to the Virtual MG or created (in the 
         case of ephemeral terminations) by that Virtual MG."

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This is the availability status of the Media Gateway in 
         accordance with the AvailabiltiyStatus textual convention and 
         ITU-T Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2.  This object is set-valued 
         and read-only and can have zero or more of the values that 
         follow.  When the value of this attribute is empty, this 
         implies that none of the status conditions described below are 
         present.
         
         - inTest(0), the Media Gateway is undergoing a test procedure.  
           If the administrative state is locked or shutting down, then 
           normal users are precluded from using the resource and the 
           control status attribute has the value reserved for test.  
           Tests that do not exclude additional users can be present in 
           any operational or administrative state but the reserved for 
           test condition should not be present.
           
         - failed(1), the Media Gateway has an internal fault that 
           prevents it from operating.  The operational state is 
           disabled.
           
         - powerOff(2), the Media Gateway requires power to be applied 
           and is not powered on.  For example, a fuse or other 
           protection device is known to have removed power or a low 
           voltage condition has been detected.  The operational state 
           is disabled.
           
         - offLine(3), the Media Gateway requires a routing operation to 
           be performed to place it online and make it available for 
           use.  The operation may be manual or automatic or both.  The 
           operational state is disabled.
           
         - offDuty(4), the Media Gateway has been made inactive by an 
           internal control process in accordance with a predetermined 
           time schedule.  Under normal conditions the control process 
           can be expected to reactivate the Media Gateway at some 
           scheduled time, and it is therefore considered to be 
           optional.  The operational state is either enabled or 
           disabled.
           
         - dependency(5), the Media Gateway cannot operate because some 
           other resource on which it depends is (i.e, a resource not 
           represented by the same managed object) unavailable.  For 
           example, a device is not accessible because its controller is 
           powered off.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - degraded(6), the service available from the Media Gateway is 
           degraded in some respect, such as in speed or operating 
           capacity.  Failure of a test or an unacceptable performance 
           measurement has established that some or all services are not 
           functional or are degraded due to the presence of a defect.  
           However, the Media Gateway remains available for service, 
           either because some services are satisfactory or because 
           degraded service is preferable to no service at all.  The 
           operational state is enabled.
           
         - notInstalled(7), the managed object representing the Media 
           Gateway is not present, or is incomplete.  For example, 
           a plug-in module is missing, a cable is disconnected or 
           a software module is not loaded.  The operational state is 
           disabled.
           
         - logFull(8), this indicates a log full condition, the 
           semantics of which are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.735.

         - locked(0), use of the Media Gateway Controller has been 
           prohibited by a management station; setting the value to 
           locked(0) results in the immediate and disruptive withdrawa

         following conditions:
         
         - inTest(0), the Media Gateway Controller is undergoing a test 
           procedure.  If the administrative state is locked(0), or 
           shuttingDown(2), then normal users are precluded from using 
           the MGC and the control status attribute has the value

           users can be present in any operational or administrative 
           state but the reserved for test condition should not be 
           present.
           
         - failed(1), the Media Gateway Controller has an internal fault 
           that prevents it from operating.  The operational state is 
           disabled.
           
         - powerOff(2), the Media Gateway Controller requires power to 
           be applied and is not powered on.  The operational state is 
           disabled.
           
         - offLine(3), the Media Gateway Controller requires a routing 
           operation to be performed to place it online and make it 
           available for use.  The operation may be manual or automatic 
           or both.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - offDuty(4), the Media Gateway Controller has been made 
           inactive by an internal control process in accordance with 
           a predetermined time schedule.  Under normal conditions the 
           control process can be expected to reactivate the Media 
           Gateway Controller at some scheduled time, and it is 
           therefore considered to be optional.  The operational state 
           is either enabled or disable.
           
         - dependency(5), the Media Gateway Controller cannot operatre 
           because some other resource on which it depends is 
           unavailable.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - degraded(6), the service available from the Media Gateway 
           Controller is degraded in some respect, such as in speed or 
           operating capacity.  Failure of a test or an unacceptable 
           performance measurement has established that some or all 
           services are not functional or are degraded due to the 
           presence of a defect.  However, the Media Gateway Controller 
           remains available for service, either because some services 
           are satisfactory or because degraded service is preferable to 
           no service at all.  The operational state is enabled.
           
         - notInstalled(7), the Media Gateway Controller is not present, 
           or is incomplete.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - logFull(8), this indicates a log full condition, the 
           semantics of which are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.735.
         
         Note that these semantics are from the viewpoint of the managed

         - notInitialized(1), the MGC requires initialization before it 
           can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not 
           been initiated.  The MGC initializes itself autonomously.  
           The operational state is disabled.
         
         - initializing(2), the MGC requires initialization before it can 
           perform its normal functions, and this procedure has been 
           initiated, but is not yet complete.  When this condition is 
           present, the initializationRequired(0) and notInitialized(1) 
           conditions are absent, since initialization has already 
           begun.  The operational state is disabled.
           
         - reporting(3), the MGC has failed and is reporting failure.
           
         - terminating(4), the MGC is in a termination phase.  If the 
           MGC does not reinitialize itself autonomously, the 
           initializationRequired(0) condition is also present and the 
           operational state is disabled; otherwise, the operational

         Note that when the MGC in question is remote to the managed 
         system, this is the view of the procedural status of the remote

         the MGC is a Master; slave(2), otherwise.  Only one protection 
         group of MGCs can be designated as master(1) for a given host.  
         Setting a different protection group of MGCs to master(1) will 
         cause all other protection groups of MGCs to be set to slave(2).  
         Setting one MGC in a protection group to master(1) will result 
         in all other MGC in the protect group to be set to master(1).  
         The same is true for a slave(2) setting.  Both rules are in 
         effect when the setting defaults to msater(1), or when 
         protection groups are formed or severed.  An MGC; however, can 
         be master(1) for one set of virtual MGs, and slave(2) for 
         another.
         
         A physical MG that is partitioned into multiple Virtual MGs that 
         are controlled by different MGC must always know which of its 
         controlling MGCs should be notified if an event occurs on the 
         interface.  Manipulation of a physical interface shared by the 
         virtual MGs should only be performed by one MGC.  Any of the 
         MGCs is allowed to create Events Descriptors to be notified of 
         shared events, but only one MGC can have read/write access to 
         the physical interface properties; all other MGCs have read-only 
         access.  The MGC with the read/write access is designated the 
         Master MGC."

    DESCRIPTION 
        "A maximum inactivity time value of zero (0) disabled inactivity 
         timing.
         
         An MGC that supports the ITU-T Rec. H.248.14 inactivity timer 
         package may detect whether or not the MG supports the package by 
         auditing it.  The MGC will set this maximum inactivity time on 
         the ROOT termination for the MG.  The MGC on the control 
         association should, regardless, ensure that the time between 
         messages sent to the MG never exceeds this period.  The MGC 
         ensures this by sending any message as a test or keep-alive 
         message (such as an empty Audit of ROOT) whenever no other 
         message is needed within the period.
         
         The MG will monitor incoming messages for periods of silence 
         exceeding this maximum inactivity time value.  On the detection 
         of an excessive period of silence, a Notify with the observed 
         event of inactivity timeout will be generated.  If the MGC has 
         failed, the event will not receive a reply.  If no reply is 
         received the MG will consider the MGC to have failed and will 
         follow the procedures of ITU-T Rec. H.248.1/11.5.
         
         The MG that detects the inactivity timeout will generate the 
         notification.
         
         Note that only SCTP is capable of monitoring communications 
         linkages without this mechanism; however, an active SCTP 
         association does not necessarily mean that an active MGC-MG 
         control association exists (the application on either end of the 
         SCTP association could have failed).
         
         Note that this value may be changed autonomously by the managed 
         system.  For example, the value can be changed at the MG by the 
         MGC by setting the Maximum Inactivity Timer property of the ROOT 
         termination at the MG."

        "This column determines whether keep-alive messages used to

         recommended by RFC 793, which is false(2).
         
         When true(1), a keep-alive timer is activated to monitor idle 
         connections that might no longer exist.  If a connection has 
         been idle since the last keep-alive timeout, a keep-alive 
         packet is sent to check if the connection is still alive or 
         broken.
         
         Keep-alive packets are not an explicit feature of TCP, and this 
         practise is not universally accepted.  According to RFC 1122 
         ``a keep-alive mechanism should only be invoked in service 
         applications that might otherwise hang indefinitely and consume 
         resources unnecessarily if a client crashes or aborts

         Enabling keep-alive increases the protocol's responsiveness in 
         detection of failure and redirection of traffic away from 
         failed paths and interfaces.  However, TCP connections are far 
         less robust on noisy or congested links with keep-alive

    DESCRIPTION 
        "Instances of the protectionUnitR1 managed object class may be 
         automatically created in the agent, e.g., immediately following 
         the initialization of the NE resources (e.g. such as circuit 
         pack) involved in the protection system, according to the 
         make-up and mode of the NE.  Instances of this entity may be 
         deleted by the agent, e.g. upon the deletion of the 
         corresponding resource objects.  The agent may also create and 
         delete instances of this object class to reflect local 
         modifications in the protection schemes.
         
         (Instances of this object class may also be created or deleted 
         as the result of management operations to the 
         protectionCoordinator object (defined in ITU-T Rec.  G.774.9) 
         of an NE, such as the establishProtection, dismissProtection 
         and modifyProtection actions.)
         
         Two or more instances of the protectUnitR1 object may exist 
         within an instance of the protectionGroupR2 object.
         
         An instance of the protectionUnitR1 object could contain an 
         instance of the protectionCurrentData object (defined in ITU-T 
         Rec. G.774.1).
         
         A protectionUnitR1 instance is related to instances of resource 
         entities (e.g. Circuit Pack) via the unreliableReourcePointer 
         attribute.  If the funciton of the resource entities (e.g. 
         timing function, transport termination point function, etc.) is 
         explicitly modelled as object instances in the NE, then 
         a protectionUnitR1 instance is also related to instances of the 
         modelled function entity via the reliableResourcePointer 
         attribute.
         
         This object class has the following attributes:
         
         - gcpProtUnitProtectionStatus: Protection Status R1.  This 
           read-only attribute indicates the status of the protection 
           switch in a Protection Unit object.  The following behaviour 
           applies to this attribute:
           
           - This attribute must be capable of indicating pending as 
             well as active switching requests relative to the 
             protection unit.  However, only one of the values lockout, 
             forced switch, or manual switch can be present at the same 
             time.
             
           - A protection system may support only a subset of the 
             allowable values of this attribute.  The subset of values 
             to be supported by a system is implementation-specific.
             
           - The syntax of this attribute indicates a subfield 
             'relatedUnit' that is of ASN.1 CHOICE of 
             'fromProtectionUnitNumber' and 'toProtectionUnitNumber'.  
             This subfield is used to indicate on which unit the service 
             is carried.
             
             - For a protected PU, both the fromProtectionUnitNumber 
               (fromPU#) and the toProtectionUnitNumber (toPU#) hold the 
               ID of the related protecting PU.  When switching to the 
               protecting PU (i.e. service will be carried by the 
               protecting PU), the toProtectionUnitNumber choice is 
               used.  When switching back to the protected PU (service 
               will be carried by the protected PU), the 
               fromProtectionUnitNumber choice is used.
               
             - For a protecting PU, both the fromProtectionUnitNumber 
               (fromPU#) and the toProtectionUnitNumber (toPU#) hold the 
               ID of the related protected PU.  When switching to the 
               protected PU (i.e. service will be carried by the 
               protected PU), the toProtectionUnitNumber choice is used.  
               When swtiching to the protecting PU (service will be 
               carried by the protecting PU), the 
               fromProtectionUnitNumber choice is used.
               
           - If a system can support protection switching due to 
             Resource Degrade (RD) besides Resource Fail (RF), 
             protection switching of RD is similar to that in the 
             subsequent description for RF.
             
           - The following allowable Protection Status values are 
             associated with each protected Protection Unit (PU).
             
             - No Request: No switch request is present on the unit.  In 
               this case, services is on the protected PU, status syntax 
               is noRequest.  For non-revertive system, the status 
               syntax of the related protecting PU is also noRequest.
               
             - Manual Switch to Protecting Unit Complete: The unit has 
               completed a Manual Switch.  In this case, service is on 
               the related protecting PU, status suntax of the protected 
               PU is manualSwitch (switchStatus: completed; relatedUnit 
               toPU#).  Status syntax of the related protecting PU is 
               manualSwitch (switchStatus: completed; relatedUnit: 
               fromPU#).
               
             - Release Failed: A time-out occurs while waiting for 
               a release.  In this case, service is still on the 
               protecting PU, status syntax is releaseFailed plus the 
               previous status, such as manualSwitch (switchStatus: 
               completed, relatedUnit: toPU#).  Status syntax of the 
               related protecting PU is still the previous status, such 
               as manualSwitch (switchStatus: completed; relatedUnit: 
               fromPU#).
               
             - Automatic Switch (RF) Pending: The unit has a Fail 
               condition present and the protecting unit is unavailable.  
               In this case, service is still on the protected PU, 
               status syntax is autoSwitch (switchStatus: pending; 
               relatedUnit: toPU#; reason: RF). Status syntax of the 
               related protecting PU is autoSwitch (switchStatus: 
               pending, relatedUnit: fromPU#; reason: RF) plus its 
               previous status.
               
             - Automatic Swtich (RF) Complete: The unit has completed an 
               Automatic Switch to the protecting unit due to an 
               Equipment Fail condition.  In this case, service is on 
               the related protecting PU, status syntax of the protected 
               PU is autoSwitch (switchStatus: completed; relatedUnit: 
               toPU#; reason: RF).  Status syntax of the related 
               protecting PU is autoSwitch (switchStatus: completed; 
               relatedUnit: fromPU#; reason: RF).
               
             - Automatic Switch (RF) Present, Operate failed: An 
               automatic switch (RF) request is in progress and 
               a time-out occurs while waiting for completion.  In this 
               case, service is still on the protected PU, status syntax 
               is autoSwitch (switchStatus: failed; relatedUnit: toPU#; 
               reason: RF).  Status syntax of the related protecting PU 
               is autoSwitch (switchStatus: pending;  relatedUnit: 
               fromPU#; reason: RF) plus its previous status."

         This attribute is used to indicate the status of the protection 
         switch in a protectionUnit instance. This attribute is 
         set-valued because some requests are allowed to be pending.
         
         The following rule shall be followed:
         
         Only one of the values lockout, forcedSwitch, or manualSwitch 
         can be present at the same time, either local or remote. It is 
         also possible to have two or more pending automatic switch 
         requests.
         
         The protectionStatus attribute of a protection Unit which 
         provides protection is used to hold the protection request 
         which is actually performed on that protectionUnit. Locally 
         invoked management operations (e.g. manual, forced, lockout 
         switch completions) can be overridden at the near end or the 
         far end, but may only be released at the near end. Single-ended 
         systems keep the status of local and far-end switch requests as 
         separate entities in the protectionStatus attribute.
         
         The remainder of this behaviour provides the allowable 
         protectionStatus attribute values for protected and protecting 
         units for both revertive and non-revertive systems.
         
         The following allowable protectionStatus values are associated 
         with each protected unit:
         
         - No Request: No switch request is present on the unit.
           
         - Manual Switch to Protecting Complete: The unit has completed 
           a Manual Switch. Release failed A switch has been released or 
           pre-empted and a timeout occurs while waiting for a release 
           of associated bridges, or the near-end switch.
           
         - Automatic Switch (SF) Pending: The unit has a Signal Fail 
           condition present and the protecting unit is unavailable.
           
         - Automatic Switch (SD) Pending: The unit has a Signal Degrade 
           condition present and the protecting unit is unavailable.

         If an MG fails, but is capable of sending a message to the MGC, 
         it sends a ServiceChange with an appropriate method (Graceful or 
         Forced) and specifies the Root TerminationID.  When it returns 
         to service, it sends a ServiceChange with a ``Restart'' 
         ServiceChangeMethod.
         
         Allowing the MGC to send duplicate messages to both MGs 
         accommodates pairs of MGs that are capable of redundant fail-over 
         of one of the MGs.  Only the Working MG shall accept or reject 
         transactions.  Upon fail-over, the primary MG sends 
         a ServiceChange Command with a ``Failover'' method and a ``MG 
         Impending Failure'' reason.  The MGC then uses the secondary MG 
         as the active MG.  When the error condition is repaired, the 
         working MG can send a ``ServiceChange'' with a ``Restart'' 
         ServiceChangeMethod.
         
         NOTE -- that redundant failover MGs require a reliable transport,

gcpMgcFailure NOTIFICATION-TYPE
    OBJECTS     { tmnObjectInstance }
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "If the MG detects a failure of its controlling MGC, it attempts to 
         contact the next MGC on its pre-provisioned list.  It starts its 
         attempts at the beginning (primary MGC), unless that was the MGC that 
         failed, in which case it starts at its first secondary MGC.  It sends 
         a ServiceChange message with a ``Failover'' method and a ``MGC 
         Impending Failure'' reason.  If the MG is unable to establish a control 
         relationship with any MGC, it shall wait a random amount of time as 
         described in ITU-T Rec.  H.248.1/9.2 and then start again contacting 
         its primary, and (if necessary) its secondary MGCs.  When contacting 
         its previous controlling MGC, the MG sends the ServiceChagne message 
         with ``Disconnected'' method.
         
         In partial failure, or for manual maintenance reasons, an MGC may wish 
         to direct its controlled MGs to use a different MGC.  To do so, it 
         sends a ServiceChange method to the MG with a ``Handoff'' method, and 
         its designated replacement in ServiceChangeMgcID.  If ``Handoff'' is 
         supported, the MGC shall send a ServiceChange message with 
         a ``Handoff'' method and a ``MGC directed change'' reason to the 
         designated MGC.  If it fails to get a rely from the designated MGC, the 
         MG shall behave as if its MGC failed, and start contacting secondary 
         MGCs as specified in the previous paragraph.  If the MG is unabled to 
         establish a control relationship with any MGC, it shall wait a random 
         amount of time as described in ITU-T Rec.  H.248.1/9.2 and then start 
         contacting its primary, and if necessary, its secondary MGCs again.
         
         No recommendation is made on how the MGCs invoked in the hand-off 
         maintain state information; this is considered to be out of scope of 
         this Recommendation.  The MGC and MG may take the following steps when 
         hand-off occurs.  When the MGC iinitiates a hand-off, the handover should 
         be transparent to operations on the Media Gateway.  Transactions can be 
         executed in any order, and could be in progress when the ServiceChange 
         is executed.  Accordingly, commands in progress continue and replies to 
         all commands from the original MGC must be sent to the transport 
         address from which they were sent.  If the service relationship with 
         the sending MGC has ended, the replies should be discarded.  The MG may 
         receive outstanding transaction replies from the new MGC.  No new 
         messages shall be sent to the new MGC until the control association is 
         established.  Repeated transaction requests shall be directed to the 
         new MGC.  The MG shall maintain the state of all terminations and 
         contexts.
         
         It is possible that the MGC could be implemented in such a way that 
         a failed MGC is replaced by a working MGC where the identity of the new 
         MGC is the same as the failed one.  In such a case, the 
         ServiceChangeMgcID would be specified with the previous value and the 
         MG shall behave as if the value was changed, and send a ServiceChange 
         message as above.
         
         Pairs of MGCs that are capable of redundant fail-over can notify the 
         controlled MGCs of the fail-over by the above mechanism. "

         A MG is pre-provisioned with a primary (protected) and 
         optionally an ordered list of secondary (protecting) MGCs.  
         Upon a cold start of the MG, it will issue a ServiceChange 
         Command with a ``Restart'' method, on the Root Termination to 
         its primary MGC.  If the MGC accepts the MG, it sends 
         a TransactionReply not including a ServiceChangeMgcID parameter.  
         If the MGC does not accept the MG's registration, it sends 
         a TransactionReply, providing the address of an alternate MGC to 
         be contacted by including a ServiceChangeMgcID parameter.
         
         If the MG receives a TransactionReply that includes 
         a ServiceChangeMgcID parameter, it sends a ServiceChange to the 
         MGC specified in the ServiceChangeMgcID.  It continues this 
         process until it gets a controlling MGC to accept its 
         registration, or it fails to get a reply.  Upon failure to 
         obtain a reply, either from the primary MGC, or a designated
