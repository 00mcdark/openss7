-- top level

Ss7ProfileId ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
	"A configured name associated with an SS7 signalling protocol 
	 profile."
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING

MilliSeconds ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d-3"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
	"This textual convetion is used to represent time durations in 
	 milliseconds instead of centiseconds as is TimeValue."
    SYNTAX      Unsigned32

Ss7ProtocolStandard ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
	"This textual convention is used for identifying the protocol 
	 standard.  This is the same values as are used by protocol 
	 management."
    SYNTAX      INTEGER { itut(0), etsi(1), jttc(2), china(3), 
		    ingapore(4), spain(5) }

Ss7ProtocolYear ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d-0"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
	"This textual convention is used for identifying the standard 
	 issue year.  Only values within a 4 year interval are 
	 significant; that is, 1988..1991 are all interpreted as 1988, 
	 1992..1995 are interpreted as 1992, etc."
    SYNTAX      Integer32 (1984..2999)

Ss7ProtocolOptions ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
	"This textual convention is used to specify protocol options 
	 accross anumber of protocol levels.  Not all protocol options 
	 apply to all levels.  When a protocol option is set for a level 
	 to which it does not apply, it has no effect."
    SYNTAX      BITS { mplev(0), pcr(1), hsl(2), xsn(3), nopr(4) }

CircuitIdentificationCode ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d-0"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
	"This an an SS7 circuit identification code as used by TUP or 
	 ISUP to identify a circuit (channel) between two signalling 
	 point codes (MTP instances).  In ITU-T based networks, this can 
	 take on the value (0..4095).  In ANSI based networks, this can 
	 take on the value from (0..65535).  At one time, the 12 bits of 
	 the ITU-T CIC were broken into 3 x 4-bit fields to identify the 
	 facility, group and channel of the circuit.  Nowadays, while 
	 the low order 4 bits still represents the channel for E1, CICs 
	 are assigned pseudo-arbitrarily to circuits.  The only 
	 constraint is that a contiguous range of CICs are assigned to 
	 the channels making up a circuit group."
    SYNTAX      Integer32 (0..65535)

CommonLanguageName ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "1a"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
	"In the Telcordia style, this is an extended Common Lanuage 
	 Location Identifier.  The identifier is a Telcordia CLLI 
	 extended by a brief text string identifying the equipment or 
	 facility at the switch location.  Alternately, barring a CLLI 
	 assignment from Telcorida or other name assigning body, this 
	 can be any fixed fielded ASCII identifier.  It should not 
	 contain control characters, graphics characters, nor 
	 whitespace"
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING (SIZE(0..32))

CircuitCode ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "1x-"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
	"This is a physical point of appearance (PPA) or circuit code 
	 which uniquely identifies a circuit within the managed 
	 switching element."
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING (SIZE(4))

ActionOrResult ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS	current
    DESCRIPTION
	"Models an CMIB action command and result.  When used in the 
	 syntax clause of an object, the maximum access clause should 
	 be read-write.  Writing any value results in the invocation of 
	 the action.  Reading the value provides the current result of 
	 the invocation of the action."
    SYNTAX      INTEGER { success(0), pending(1), failure(2), timeout(3), preempted(4) }
