TimesOfDay ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "1d:1d,"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention specifies times of day by hour and 
         minute and replaces the following ASN.1 syntax:
         
         TimesOfDay ::= SET OF Time24
         
         It consists of an octet string that is an integral multiple of 
         2 octets.  Each 2 octet grouping is coded as a Time24 textual 
         convention representing one time of day.  Each two-octet 
         grouping represents as separate time of day."

    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING

TimesOfWeek ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "1x"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention specifies intervals in the day for days

         The first octet of the octet string is a day of seek indicator 
         that can have bit values: sunday(0), monday(1), tuesday(2), 
         wednesday(3), thursday(4), friday(5) and saturday(6), with bit 
         position 7 unused and set to zero.  The second octet of the 
         string is an interval count indicating the number, 'n', of 
         times of day (multiples of 2 octets) to follow.  The next nx2 
         octets represent the times of day following the TimesOfDay 
         textual convention.  The pattern is repeated again beginning 
         with the week octet."

         are uploaded to a collector according to a schedule.
         
         The probe may also provide its monitoring sources as live feeds 
         to a network management station or to collectors that will 
         capture their own files from the live feed."
