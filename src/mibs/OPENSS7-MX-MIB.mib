         and may contain the following:
         
         - inTest(0), the card is undergoing a test procedure.  
           The administrative state is locked(0) and the 
           operational state is disabled(1).  This condition 
           exists while the card is powering up or is being 
           reset.  Not applicable.  The card is not tested as a 
           whole.
         
         - failed(1), the card has an internal fault that 
           prevents it from operating.  The operational state is 
           disabled.  Some cards fail when firmware cannot be 
           loaded, or the card cannot be configured for 
           operation, or some aspect of the hardware is 
           incompatible with a driver.  The operational state is 
           disabled.  An alarm will have been generated.

           and is not powered on.  For example, power 
           managements may have removed power from the device.  
           Not applicable.  Some cards do not support power 
           management.
         
         - offLine(3), the card requires a routing operation to 
           be performed to place it online an make it available 
           for use.  The operation may be manual or automatic, 
           or both.  The operational state is disabled.  When 
           the card is configured for use but the transmitters 
           and receivers have been powered down, the card is 
           considered offline.
         
         - offDuty(4), the card has been made inactve by an 
           internal control process in accordance with a 
           predetermined time schedule.  Under normal 
           conditions, the control process can be expected to 
           reactivate the card at some scheduled time.
         
         - dependency(5), the card cannot operate because some 
           other resource on which it depends is unavailable.  
           Some cards have the dependency that spans and 
           channels must at least be partially configured before 
           they are available for use.  This value is reflected 
           until at least one span and one channel are 
           configured.
         
         - degraded(6), the card is operating with degraded 
           performance.  This is the case when the card is 
           searching for a new synchronization source and a 
           yellow or red alarm condition has occurred on the 
           current synchronization source.  Some cards are 
           degraded when thier spans or circuits are degraded.
         
         - notInstalled(7), the card is not present in the 
           system or is incomplete.  The card does not exist in 
           the system, or the card exists in the system but is 
           not loaded with a driver.  The operational state is

         is performed by placing the receivers into high

           mode and are monitoring the T1/E1/J1 spans, however,

         This value cannot be written for primary or solitary 
         spans.  For backup spans, any value may be written, but 
         the value read reflects the current state of the backup 
         span.
         
         The value will transition from the hotStandby(0) or 
         coldStandby(1) value to the providingService(2) value 
         should the primary span to which this span is a backup 
         experiences a disabling fault condition or is otherwise 
         disabled by a management station.
         
         There are normally two ways that a span can be wired as 
         a standby: either the receivers are in high-impedance 
         mode and are tapped onto the same receive line as the 
         primary and the transmitters are turned off; or the 
         span is on a drop-down arrangement (through a DCCS) but 
         is receiving OOS signal (blue alarm)."
