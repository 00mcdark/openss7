         populate this parameter for the communications alarm, 
         environmental alarm, equipment alarm, processingError alarm and 
         qualityofService alarm notification must be specified in the 
         DESCRIPTION clause of an OBJECT-IDENTITY macro defining the 
         object identifier associated with the probable cause.  The 
         precise conditions under which the alarm is raised and cleared 
         (see perceivedSeverity) must also be defined in the DESCRIPTION 
         clause whenever the value is used to raise generic alarms such 
         as the communications alarm.  When used with a specific 
         notification, the use of the probable cause parameter must be 
         defined in the NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro's DESCRIPTION clause.

         In all cases, the object identifier defined by the 
         corresponding standard (i.e.  TMN specification) should be used 
         as specified in the corresponding standard.  Private values of 
         the probable cause may also be defined in OBJECT-IDENTITY

         the communications alarm, environmental alarm, equipment alarm, 
         processing error alarm or quality of service alarm 
         notifications and may occur multiply in that notification when 
         an alarm condition is set (it is not normally included when an 
         alarm condition is cleared).  This is a specific problem 
         indication that supplements the probable cause.  It contains a 
         single object identity which indiates the specific problem in 
         accordance with the SpecificProblems textual convention.

         to populate this parameter for the communications alarm, 
         environmental alarm, equipment alarm, processing error alarm or 
         quality of service alarm notification must be specified in the 
         DESCRIPTION clause of an OBJECT-IDENTITY macro defining the

         contains an object identity which indicates the information 
         type of the event in according with the InformationType textual 
         convention.

         The meaning and purpose of object identifiers that are used to 
         populate this parameter for the communicationsInformation 
         notification must be specified in the DESCRIPTION clause of an 
         OBJECT-IDENTITY macro defining the object identifiers 
         associated with the information type.  The precise conditions 
         under which the event is notified must also be defined in the 
         DESCRIPTION clause whenever the value is used to raise generic 
         information notifications such as the communicationsInformation 
         notification.  When used with a specific notification, the use 
         of the information type parameter must be defined inthe 
         NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro's DESCRIPTION clause.

         In all cases, the object identifier defined by the 
         corresponding standard (i.e. TMN specification) should be used 
         as specified in the corresponding standard.  Private values of 
         the information type may also be defined in OBJECT-IDENTITY 
         macros within a private or enterprise module definition.  Where 
         possible, however, a standard value should be used."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This notification type is used to report when the object 
         detects a communications error.

         This is one of two mechanisms of providing communications 
         alarms corresponding to TMN alarms.  One method is to provide a 
         single notification which is parameterized in a similar fashion 
         to TMN.  The other method is providing indepdendent 
         notifications for each cause.  The advantages of providing a 
         single notification for communications alarms is that the 
         management station need only monitor a single trap to receive 
         all alarm indications.  On a managed system with thousands of 
         unique alarms, this has scale benefits.

         The communicationsAlarm is modelled on the TMN notification of 
         the same name.  TMN too has the ability to provide independent 
         notifications and chose a similar unified alarm notification.

         The first parameter of the communicationsAlarm is the probable 
         cause, which is an object identifier defined with the 
         OBJECT-IDENTITY macro.  The probable cause identifies the 
         alarm.  The third parameter (second object in SNMP) is the 
         perceived severity.  Following the PerceivedSeverity textual 
         convention, this parameter indicates when the alarm has onset 
         or cleared, and when indicating onset, the relative severity in 
         telecommunications terms (warning, minor, major, critical).  
         The second parameter (optional additional object in SNMP) is a 
         sequence of specific problems that refined the alarm 
         indication.

         Because their values are defined by an OBJECT-IDENTITY macro, 
         the DESCRIPTION clause in that macro defining a probable cause 
         or specific problem should clearly identify the purpose of the 
         alarm, when it is generated, when it is cleared, and how a 
         specific problem refines the probable cause.  This makes this 
         information available to managers via the MIB generating the 
         alarms.  Where a generic value is not used, the probable cause 
         and specific problems should be defined within the MIB module 
         that use them.

         State changes and attribute value changes can be reported by 
         simply including the object with the old value and the object 
         with the new value for each object reported."

         The communicationsInformation notification is modelled on the 
         TMN notification of the same name.

         The first paraemter of the communicationInformation 
         notification is the information type, which is an object 
         identifier defined with the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro.  The 
         information type identifies the event.

         Beacuse its value is defined by an OBJECT-IDENTITY macro, the 
         DESCRIPTION clause in that macro defining an information type 
         should clearly identify the purpose of the event notification, 
         when it is geenrtated, ahd how any information data refines the 
         information type.  This makes this information available to 
         managers via the MIB generating the alarms.  When a generic 
         value is not used, the information type should be defined 
         within the MIB module that issues them."

-- cleared: The Cleared severity level indicates the clearing of one or 
-- more previously reported alarms.  The alarms to be cleared are 
-- indicated by the managed object, Event type, Probable cause, Specific 
-- problems (if present) and Correlated notifications parameters as 
-- follows:
--
-- a) If the Correlated notifications and Specific problem parameters 
--    are not present or empty, all previous alarms with the same 
--    managed object, Probable cause and Event type parameters are 
--    cleared irresepctive of whether a Notification identifier or 
--    Specific problem parameter was present in the alarms to be cleared 
--    (i.e. can clear alarms without looking at Notification identifier 
--    or Specific problem parameters).
--
-- b) If the Specific problems parameter is present and not empty, and 
--    the Correlated notifications is not present or empty, then only 
--    previous alarms that have an exact match on managed object, 
--    Probable cause, Event type, and have a matching set or subset of 
--    Specific problems will be cleared.
--
-- c) If the Correlated notifications parameter is present and not 
--    empty, those alarms listed in this parameter are cleared 
--    irrespective of the value for the managed object, Probable cause, 
--    Event type and Specific problems parameters.  In addition, all 
--    alarms which match managed object are also cleared as specified in 
--    b) above, or as in a), ignoring the presence of the Correlated

         same number of units as the protectedUnits field.  If 
         the request is Lockout, the protectionEntity field may

         (i.e. backup or standby) unit.  For a protecting 
         protection unit, the attribute protecting shall have 
         the value TRUE.  For a protectd protection unit, the 
         attribute protecting shall have the value FALSE.  The

         to an unreliable resource (e.g. equipment hardware or 
         termination point) that is associated with the

    DESCRIPTION
        "Instances of the protectionUnitR1 managed object class 
         may be automatically created in the agent, e.g., 
         immediately following the initialization of the NE 
         resources (e.g. such as circuit pack) involved in the 
         protection system, according to the make-up and mode of 
         the NE.  Instances of this entity may be deleted by the 
         agent, e.g. upon the deletion of the corresponding 
         resource objects.  The agent may also create and delete 
         instances of this object class to reflect local 
         modifications in the protection schemes.

         (Instances of this object class may also be created or 
         deleted as the result of management operations to the 
         protectionCoordinator object (defined in ITU-T Rec. 
         G.774.9) of an NE, such as the establishProtection, 
         dismissProtection and modifyProtection actions.)

         Two or more instances of the protectUnitR1 object may 
         exist within an instance of the protectionGroupR2 
         object.

         An instance of the protectionUnitR1 object could 
         contain an instance of the protectionCurrentData object 
         (defined in ITU-T Rec. G.774.1).

         A protectionUnitR1 instance is related to instances of 
         resource entities (e.g. Circuit Pack) via the 
         unreliableReourcePointer attribute.  If the funciton of 
         the resource entities (e.g. timing function, transport 
         termination point function, etc.) is explicitly 
         modelled as object instances in the NE, then 
         a protectionUnitR1 instance is also related to 
         instances of the modelled function entity via the 
         reliableResourcePointer attribute.

         This object class has the following attributes:

         - rtpswPuProtectionStatus: Protection Status R1.  This 
           read-only attribute indicates the status of the 
           protection switch in a Protection Unit object.  The 
           following behaviour applies to this attribute:

           - This attribute must be capable of indicating 
             pending as well as active switching requests 
             relative to the protection unit.  However, only one 
             of the values lockout, forced switch, or manual 
             switch can be present at the same time.

           - A protection system may support only a subset of 
             the allowable values of this attribute.  The subset 
             of values to be supported by a system is 
             implementation-specific.

           - The syntax of this attribute indicates a subfield 
             'relatedUnit' that is of ASN.1 CHOICE of 
             'fromProtectionUnitNumber' and 
             'toProtectionUnitNumber'.  This subfield is used to 
             indicate on which unit the service is carried.

             Â· For a protected PU, both the 
               fromProtectionUnitNumber (fromPU#) and the 
               toProtectionUnitNumber (toPU#) hold the ID of the 
               related protecting PU.  When switching to the 
               protecting PU (i.e. service will be carried by 
               the protecting PU), the toProtectionUnitNumber 
               choice is used.  When switching back to the 
               protected PU (service will be carried by the 
               protected PU), the fromProtectionUnitNumber 
               choice is used.

             Â· For a protecting PU, both the 
               fromProtectionUnitNumber (fromPU#) and the 
               toProtectionUnitNumber (toPU#) hold the ID of the 
               related protected PU.  When switching to the 
               protected PU (i.e. service will be carried by the 
               protected PU), the toProtectionUnitNumber choice 
               is used.  When swtiching to the protecting PU 
               (service will be carried by the protecting PU), 
               the fromProtectionUnitNumber choice is used.
         
           - If a system can support protection switching due to 
             Resource Degrade (RD) besides Resource Fail (RF), 
             protection switching of RD is similar to that in 
             the subsequent description for RF.

           - The following allowable Protection Status values 
             are associated with each protected Protection Unit 
             (PU).

             Â· No Request: No switch request is present on the 
               unit.  In this case, services is on the protected 
               PU, status syntax is noRequest.  For 
               non-revertive system, the status syntax of the 
               related protecting PU is also noRequest.

             Â· Manual Switch to Protecting Unit Complete: The 
               unit has completed a Manual Switch.  In this 
               case, service is on the related protecting PU, 
               status suntax of the protected PU is manualSwitch 
               (switchStatus: completed; relatedUnit toPU#). 
               Status syntax of the related protecting PU is 
               manualSwitch (switchStatus: completed; 
               relatedUnit: fromPU#).

             Â· Release Faild: A time-out occurs while waiting 
               for a release.  In this case, service is still on 
               the protecting PU, status syntax is releaseFailed 
               plus the previous status, such as manualSwitch 
               (switchStatus: completed, relatedUnit: toPU#).  
               Status syntax of the related protecting PU is 
               still the previous status, such as manualSwitch 
               (switchStatus: completed; relatedUnit: fromPU#).

             Â· Automatic Switch (RF) Pending: The unit has 
               a Fail condition present and the protecting unit 
               is unavailable.  In this case, service is still 
               on the protected PU, status syntax is autoSwitch 
               (switchStatus: pending; relatedUnit: toPU#; 
               reason: RF). Status syntax of the related 
               protecting PU is autoSwitch (switchStatus: 
               pending, relatedUnit: fromPU#; reason: RF) plus 
               its previous status.

             Â· Automatic Swtich (RF) Complete: The unit has 
               completed an Automatic Switch to the protecting 
               unit due to an Equipment Fail condition.  In this 
               case, service is on the related protecting PU, 
               status syntax of the protected PU is autoSwitch 
               (switchStatus: completed; relatedUnit: toPU#; 
               reason: RF).  Status syntax of the related 
               protecting PU is autoSwitch (switchStatus: 
               completed; relatedUnit: fromPU#; reason: RF).

             Â· Automatic Switch (RF) Present, Operate failed: An 
               automatic switch (RF) request is in progress and 
               a time-out occurs while waiting for completion.  
               In this case, service is still on the protected 
               PU, status syntax is autoSwitch (switchStatus: 
               failed; relatedUnit: toPU#; reason: RF).  Status 
               syntax of the related protecting PU is autoSwitch 
               (switchStatus: pending;  relatedUnit: fromPU#; 
               reason: RF) plus its previous status.

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This attribute is used to indicate the status of the 
         protection switch in a protectionUnit instance. This 
         attribute is set-valued because some requests are 
         allowed to be pending.

         The following rule shall be followed:

         Only one of the values lockout, forcedSwitch, or 
         manualSwitch can be present at the same time, either 
         local or remote. It is also possible to have two or 
         more pending automatic switch requests.

         The protectionStatus attribute of a protection Unit 
         which provides protection is used to hold the 
         protection request which is actually performed on that 
         protectionUnit. Locally invoked management operations 
         (e.g. manual, forced, lockout switch completions) can 
         be overridden at the near end or the far end, but may 
         only be released at the near end. Single-ended systems 
         keep the status of local and far-end switch requests as 
         separate entities in the protectionStatus attribute.

         The remainder of this behaviour provides the allowable 
         protectionStatus attribute values for protected and 
         protecting units for both revertive and non-revertive 
         systems.

         The following allowable protectionStatus values are 
         associated with each protected unit:

         - No Request: No switch request is present on the unit.

         - Manual Switch to Protecting Complete: The unit has 
           completed a Manual Switch. Release failed A switch 
           has been released or pre-empted and a timeout occurs 
           while waiting for a release of associated bridges, or 
           the near-end switch.

         - Automatic Switch (SF) Pending: The unit has a Signal 
           Fail condition present and the protecting unit is 
           unavailable.

         - Automatic Switch (SD) Pending: The unit has a Signal 
           Degrade condition present and the protecting unit is 
           unavailable.

         - Automatic Switch (SF) Complete: The unit has 
           completed an Automatic Switch to the protecting unit
