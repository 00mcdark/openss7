MtpAvailabilityStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
	STATUS		current
	DESCRIPTION
		"This textual convention provides the status of an MTP 
		 entity, such as a route set, route or signalling point.  
		 When inactive(0), the route set is inactive and does 
		 not carry user traffic; blocked(1), configured and able 
		 to carry traffic but blocked by transport; 
		 inhibited(2), management inhibited, but able to carry 
		 traffic; prohibited(3), prohibited by relay; 
		 restart(4), relay or endpoint restarting; 
		 restricted(5), restricted by relay; congested(6), 
		 endpoint congested; danger(7), in danger of congestion; 
		 allowed(8), allowed to to destination.

		 Where the MTP managed object whose status is 
		 represented contains other managed objects with an MTP 
		 status, the MTP status of the managed object is the 
		 set-union (logical OR) of the contained managed 
		 objects."
