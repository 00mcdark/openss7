	 On-line Facility Registration facility, using the 
	 FacilityWhileIdle textual convention.
	
	 For a DTE subscribed to ths On-line Facility

	 subscription of facilities reported by the DCE or DXE 
	 in a registration confirmation packet, and is writable 
	 by a management station when the administrative state 
	 is 'locked' and subject to negotiation with the DCE.
	
	 For a DTE not subscribed to the On-line Facility 
	 Registration facility, this set value represents the 
	 subscription of facilities, agreed to for a time 
	 between the DTE and DCE, and is writable by a 
	 management station when the administrative stat is 
	 'locked' but without negotiation with the DCE.
	
	 For a DCE, this set value represents the subscribed 
	 facilities, agreed to for a time between the DCE and 
	 the DTE and will be reported to the DTE in a 
	 registration confirmation packet, and is writable by a 
	 management station.
	
	 The facilities that may be contained in the set, 
	 indicating subscription, are as follows:
	
	 - ePSN(0),  Extended Packet Sequence Numbering; this 
	   value should only be set by the agent when the 
	   correspoding bit in the X25PLEFacilityAvailability 
	   column is also set.
	
	 - pR(1), Packet Retransmission; this value should only 
	   be set by the agent when the corresponding bit in the 
	   x25PLEFacilityAvailability column is also set.
	
	 - dM(2), D-bit Modification; this value should only be 
	   set by the agent when the corresponding bit in the 
	   x25PLEFacilityAvailability column is also set.
	
	 - sPSN(3), Super Extended Packet Sequence Numbering; 
	   this value should only be set by the agent when the 
	   corresponding bit in the x25PLEFacilityAvailability 
	   column is also set.  Super Extended Packet Sequence 
	   Numbering is not supported in protocol versions 
	   earlier than ITU-T Rec. X.25 (1996).
	
	 - tNAS(4), TOA/NPI Address Subscription.
	
	 Note that for DTE subscribed to the On-line Facility 
	 Registration facility, writing to this column while the 
	 X.25 PLE is operational and locked will result in a 
	 registration request packet being issued to the DCE or 
	 DXE.  Reading the value will return the facilities 
	 reported as subscribed the the DCE in a registration 
	 confirmation packet.
	
	 When the DTE is subscribed to the On-line Facility

	 A system shall return and error when an attempt is made 
	 to set the value to a value that is not supported by

	 Extended Packet Sequence Numbering and Super Extended

	 that require subscription followed by dynamic

	 ITU-T Rec. X.25 only permits this value to be set for 
	 an entire DTE.  That is, where the setting applies to 
	 all switched virtual calls and permanent virtual 
	 circuits (logical channels) proviided by the DTE X.25 
	 Packet Layer Entity.  It also permits the packet 
	 sequence numbering scheme to be applied individually to 
	 each logical channel for the DTE X.25 PLE.  When the 
	 network supports the user of multiple modulos at the 
	 same interface, for virtual calls the selection is made 
	 by signalling of the GFI, for permanent virtual 
	 circuits, the modulo is established by subscription."

	"The subscription of the DTE to the Hunt Group facility 
	 as described in ITU-T Recommendation X.2. Expressed as 
	 a TruthValue where a value of 'true(1)' indicates 
	 subscription and a value of false(2) indicates 
	 non-subscription.
	
	 The Hunt Group facility is an optional user faciltiy 
	 that requires subscription only on a circuit switched 
	 or packet switched network.
	
	 Note that neither the Hunt Group facility nor the 
	 Called Line Address Modificiation Notificaiton facility 
	 is not supported by the 1980 version of X.25, x2580(8).
	
	 Hunt Group is an optional user facility agreed for a 
	 period of time.  This user facility, if subscribed to, 
	 distributes incoming calls having an address associated 
	 with the hunt group across a designated grouping of 
	 DTE/DCE interfaces.
	
	 Selection is performed forn an incoming virtual call if 
	 there is at least one logical channel in the ready 
	 state (see X.25/4.1.1), excluding one-way outgoing 
	 logical channels, available for virtual calls on any of 
	 the DTE/DCE interfaces in the group.  Once a virtual 
	 call is assigned to a DTE/DCE interface, it is treated 
	 as a regular call.
	
	 When virtual calls are placed to a hunt group address 
	 in the case that specific addresses have also been 
	 assigned to the individual DTE/DCE interfaces, the 
	 clear indication packet (when no call accepted packet 
	 has been transmitted) or the call connected packet 
	 transferred to the calling DTE may contain the called 
	 DTE address of the selected DTE/DCE interface and the 
	 Called Line Address Modified Notification facility (see 
	 X.25/6.26) indicating the reason why the called DTE 
	 address is different from the one originally requested.
	
	 Virtual calls may be originated by the DTEs on DTE/DCE 
	 interfaces belonging to the hunt group; these are 
	 handled in the normal manner.  In particular, the 
	 calling DTE address transferred to the remote DTE in 
	 the incoming call packet is the hunt group address 
	 unless the DTE/DCE interface has a specific address 
	 assigned.  Permanent virtual circuits may be assigned 
	 to DTE/DCE interfaces belongin to the hunt group.  
	 These permanent vritual circuits are independent of the 
	 operation of the hunt group.  Some networks may apply 
	 virtual call subscription time user facilities in 
	 common to all DTE/DCE interfaces in the hunt group, 
	 place a limit on the number of DTE/DCE interfaces in 
	 the hunt group, and/or constrain the size of the 
	 geographic region that can be served by a single hunt 
	 group."

	    party can be deteremined by using any of a number of

    DESCRIPTION
	"The subscription of the Packet Retransmissions facility

	 a TruthValue where a value of 'true(1)' indicates 
	 subscription and a value of 'false(2)' indicates 
	 non-subscription. If non-subscription, then the 
	 attributes for rejectTimer and rejectCount will have 
	 NULL values.
	
	 Packet Retranmission is an optional user facility 
	 agreed for a period of time.  It is common to all 
	 logical channels at the DTE/DCE interface.  The 
	 facility requires subscription followed by dynamic 
	 invocation on packet switched networks.
	
	 This user facility, if subscribed to, allows a DTE to 
	 requires retransmission of one or several consecutive 
	 DCE data packets from the DCE by transferring across 
	 the DTE/DCE interface a DTE reject packet specifying 
	 the logical channel number and a sequence number P(R).  
	 The value of this P(R) should be within the range from 
	 the last P(R) received by the DCE up to, but not 
	 including, the P(S) of the next DCE data packet to be 
	 transmitted by the DCE.  If the P(R) is outside this 
	 range, the DCE will initated the reset procedure with 
	 the cause 'Local procedure error' and diagnostic #2.
	
	 When received a DTE reject packet, the DCE initiates on 
	 the sepcified logical channel retransmission of the DCE 
	 dat packets, the packet send sequence numbers of which 
	 are starting from P(R), where P(R) is indicated in the 
	 DTE reject packet.  Until the DCE transfers across the 
	 DTE/DCE interface a DCE data packet with a packe send 
	 sequence number equal to the P(R) indicated in the DTE 
	 reject packet, the DCE will consider the receipt of 
	 another DTE reject packet as a procedure error and 
	 reset the logical channel.
	
	 Additional DCE data packets pending inital transmission 
	 may follow the retransmitted packet(s).
	
	 A DTE receive not ready situation indicated by the 
	 transmission of an RNR packet is cleared by the 
	 transmission of a DTE reject packet.
	
	 The conditions under which the DCE ignores a DTE reject 
	 packet, or considers it as a procedure error, are those 
	 described for flow control packets (see Annex C)."

	 The Deactivate action causes the connection to be

	 implied. Typically, this action simulates a disconnect 
	 request received across the service interface. If a 
	 more rapid means for terminating the connection exists, 
	 then this should be used. The termination shall occur
