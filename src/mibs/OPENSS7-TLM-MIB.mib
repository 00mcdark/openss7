         operation.  A transportConnectionIVMO may be used as 
         the source of initial values of attributes of 
         a transportConnection.
         
         This object contains the set of attributes 
         characterizing the manageable aspects of a transport 
         layer protocol connection.
         
         A MO of this class exists corresponding to each active 
         transport connection, i.e. for which a CR TPDU has been 
         sent or received and which has not yet been terminated.  
         An MO may also exist prior to transmission of a CR 
         TPDU, corresponding to interactions across the service 
         interface.  The precise synchronization of the creation 
         and deletion of the MO with the protocol exchanges 
         corresponding to the transport connection is not, 
         however, defined by the standard.  For example, there 
         may be a visible delay after transmission or reception 
         of a CR TPDU or interaction at the service interface 
         before the MO is created and becomes visible to 
         management.  A transport connection MO is not required 
         for terminated connections whose references have been 
         placed in the frozen state (for Class 4 operation), 
         although according to the above, the MO may remain 
         visible for some time after the connection has in other 
         resp[ectes been terminated."
