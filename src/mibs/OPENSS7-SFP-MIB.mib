    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention provides information as to which 
         warning or alarm thresholds have been crossed by which 
         monitored values.  Monitored values include temperature, supply 
         voltage, transmitter bias current, transmitted power, and 
         received power.  An object that uses this textual convention in 
         its SYNTAX clause is set-valued and may contain zero or more of 
         the following:
         
         - tempHi(0), the temperature has exceeded the high threshold;
         - tempLo(1), the temperature was beneath the low threshold;
         - vccHi(2), the supply voltage has exceeded the high threshold;
         - vccLo(3), the supply voltage was beneath the low threshold;
         - txBiasHi(4), the Tx bias has exceeded the high threshold;
         - txBiasLo(5), the Tx bias was beneath the low threshold;
         - txPowerHi(6), the Tx power has exceeded the high threshold;
         - txPowerLo(7), the Tx power was beneath the low threshold;
         - rxPowerHi(8), the Rx power has exceeded the high threshold; 
         - rxPowerLo(9), the Rx power was beneath the low threshold.
         
         An object with this textual convention in its SYNTAX clause 
         will have a MAX-ACCESS of read-only."

         SFP+ modules are permitted to require and operate at Power 
         Level 2.  SFP modules are only permitted Power Level 1 
         operation.  SFP+ modules that require Power Level 2 to be 
         operable will not funtion until the agent sets this value to 
         powerLevel2(1) permitting high power operation.  When an 
         SFP+ module requiring high-power operation is configured only 
         for low-power operation; the availability status will contain 
         initializationRequired(0) and the operational state will be 
         disabled(0).

sfpMonSoftTxDisable OBJECT-TYPE

    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "Allows management stations to control disabling of the laser.  
         This object is single valued.  When read, the object can have 
         one of the following values:
         
         - unknown(0), the module does not support the soft TxDisable 
           feature; writing to this object will have no effect;
         - asserted(1), soft TxDisable is asserted; or,
         - deasserted(2), soft TxDisable is deasserted.
         
         Provided that the module supports the feature, a value of 
         asserted(1) disables the laser.  This setting is OR'ed with the 
         hardware TX_DISABLE pin value as reflected by sfpMonTxDisable.  
         When TX_DISABLE is asserted by hardware, this value has no 
         effect.
         
         Note: per SFP MSA the TX_DISABLE pin is default enabled unless 
         pulled low by hardware.  If Soft TX Disable is not implemented, 
         the transceiver ignores the value of this setting and always 
         reads unknown(0).  The default power up value when supported is 
         deasserted(2).
         
         Not all implementations of this MIB need support writing this 
         value.  When supported, mangement stations should set this 
         value cautiously.  Asserting Tx disable will power down the 
         laser on the module causing all traffic through the module to 
         be lost.
         
         Implementations of this MIB do not require write support for 
         this object.  Mangement stations should set this value with 
         caution.  Writing this value has dubious diagnostic or testing
