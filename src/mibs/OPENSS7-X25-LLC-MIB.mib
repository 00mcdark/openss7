         Systems not supported connections to LAN media are not required 
         to support the mACDLE and contained managed objects.
         
         A mACDLE managed object may contain at modes on instance of a 
         mac-specific MO derived from the generic mAC MO.  A mACDLE MO 
         may contain at most one dLSAP MO.  The value of the sap1Address 
         attribute is of no significance.  The cardinality of the 
         userEntityNames attribute is limited to one.
         
         A mACDLE MO may be created and deleted explicitly by management 
         operation or created and deleted automatically as part of 
         system operation.
         
         When the mACDLE MO is operable, the operationalState shall have 
         the value 'enabled'; otherwise, it shall have the value 
         'disabled'.  Transitions of operationalState shall be reported 
         using the stateChange notification.
         
         The mACDLE MOC is derived from the datalinkEntity MOC.  The 
         mACDLE MO contains mAC MOs.
         
         An instance of the mACDLE MO represents an instance of the IEEE 
         802.2 MAC sublayer.  The MAC data link entity can contain mAC 
         MOs.  Each mAC MO instance contained represents a MAC address

    DESCRIPTION 
        "The station component is responsible for handling all events 
         that are directed to the LLC as a whole (i.e, events affecting 
         all SAPs and connections serviced by that LLC).  The station 
         component shall begin in the DOWN state, optionally check for a 
         duplicate station address, and potentially enter the UP state; 
         see figure 
         24 and table 1 of IEEE 802.2 (ISO/IEC 8802-2).  The UP state of 
            the LLC station component provides the enabling conditions 
            for the operation of the service access point (SAP) 
            components.
         
         The station component shall be capable of receiving and 
         responding to XID and TEST command PDUs.  It shall optionally 
         be capable of initiating the XID commend PDU, if duplicate 
         address checking is performed by the LLC entity in a particular 
         implementation; see table 2 of IEEE 802.2 (ISO/IEC 8802-2).  
         These PDUs shall used the null DSAP address to denote that the 
         station component is being referenced.
         
         The performance of the duplicate address check requires that 
         the station component be prepared to received its own XID PDUs.  
         The definition of the MAC operation provides for the ability to 
         simultaneously transmit and receive.  Since the DA = SA in the 
         XID PDUs can be used for duplicate address check, the MAC will 
         recognize its own address and pass the PDU to the station 
         component.  The station component will respond to an XID 
         command PDU with an XID responose PDU, regardless of whether it 
         originated from itself or a remote LLC.  The station component 
         provides the duplicate address check by maintaining a count of 
         received XID response PDUs.  If more than one XID response PDU 
         is received, then at least one other identical MAC DA exists on 
         the LAN.  See figure 24 and table 1 in IEEE 802.2 (ISO/IEC 
         8802-2) for details.

         configuration.  These are only default values for new

         alter operational values.

         needed only for those address and priority combinations for 
         which Type 3 commands are actually received.
         
         The Type 3 Sender component is responsible for sending Type 3 
         commands upon request of the network layer, and for processing 
         of Type 3 responses when they are received from the medium 
         access control sublayer.  At any given station there is 
         potentially a spearate Type 3 Sender component for each 
         possible combination of local LSAP, DA portion of the remote 
         address, and MAC priority.  In most applications, however, only

         A lAPBDLE MO may contain at most one dLSAP MO.  The value of

         A lAPBDLE MO may be created and deleted explicitly by 
         management operation or created and deleted automatically as a 
         part of ystem operation.
