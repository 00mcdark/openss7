-- The TCAP entity structure (TE) is the primary structure that 
-- identifies a TCAP system.  A TCAP system can contain a collection of 
-- SCCP SAPs which represent the specific entry and exit points for SCCP 
-- messages to an from the SS7 network.  Each TE structure can have 
-- multiple SP structures representing SCCP SAPs beneath it providing 
-- connectivity to the SS7 network via SC structures in turn (SC 
-- structures representing linked lower SCCP Streams).  Each TE 
-- structure can serve multiple AC structures representing one or more 
-- Application Contexts, which in turn serve TC structures (TC 
-- structures representing open upper TCAP Streams).
--
-- The TCAP Entity contains the primary lock for each TCAP Entity 
-- system.  The primary lock is used to protect the total state of the 
-- TCAP Entity and all its subtending components.  The structure of the 
-- TCAP Entity (linkage between structures within the TCAP Entity 
-- system) is protected by the master read-write TCAP multiplexing 
-- driver lock.

-- The Application Context (AC) structure has the primary purpose of 
-- providing a location where AC information can be maintained separate 
-- from a structure that is associated with an open TC User Stream.  
-- This is for information that should persist beyond the unbinding and 
-- rebinding of TC User Streams.  When the TC User Stream is bound, it 
-- is associated one-to-one with an AC structure.  AC structures can be 
-- created on demand with default information when a TC User stream is 
-- bound to a not yet existing AC.
--
-- An application context has an Application Context OID or Universal 
-- Integer associated with it that identifies the Application Context to 
-- which it corresponds.  It could also represent a wildcard Application 
-- Context.  The Application Context defines the range of dialogues that 
-- are serviced by the associated TC User for the TCAP Entity with which 
-- the AC is associated.  Each Application Context can have a defined 
-- set of valid Operations, or can have a null list of operations 
-- permitting any operation within the Application Context.

-- The TCAP structure (TC) represents an open TC User, TR User, or TP

-- upon the major and minor device number opened.  TCAP User Streams can

-- device number opened, or by temporarily linking SCCP provider Streams 
-- under the open Stream as a control Stream, or by binding the Stream.
