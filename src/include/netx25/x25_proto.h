/* From Solstice X.25 documentation:
 *
 * The LSAP is defined by the lsapformat structure.  The members of the
 * lsapformat structure are:
 *
 * lsap_len:	This gives the length of the DTE address, the MAC+SAP address,
 *		or the LCI in semi-octets.  For example, for Ethernet, the
 *		length is always 14 to indicate the MAC (12 semi-octets), plus
 *		SAP (2 semi-octets).  The SAP always follows the MAC address.
 *		The DTE can be up to 15 decimal digits unless X.25(88) and
 *		TO/NPI (Type Of Address/Numbering Plan Identification)
 *		addressing is being used, when it can be up to 17 decimal
 *		digits.  For an LCI the length is 3.
 *
 *		The length of the DTE address or LSAP as two BCD digits per
 *		byte, right justified.  An LSAP is always 14 digits long.  A
 *		DTE address can be up to 15 decimal digits unless X.25(88) and
 *		TOA/NPI addressing is used, in which case it can be up to 17
 *		decimal digits.  A PVC_LCI is 3 digits long (hexadecimal,
 *		0-4095).  For TOA/NPI the TOA is:
 *
 *		0000 0 Network-dependent number or unknown
 *		0001 1 International number
 *		0010 2 National number
 *		0011 3 Network specific number (for use in private networks)
 *		0100 4 Complementary address without main address.
 *		0101 5 Alernative address.
 *
 *		NPI for other than Alternative Address is:
 *
 *		0000 0 Network-dependent number or unknown
 *		0001 1 Rec. E.164 (digital)
 *		0010 2 Rec. E.164 (analog)
 *		0011 3 Rec. X.121
 *		0100 4 Rec. F.69 (telex numbering plan)
 *		0101 5 Private numbering plan (for private use only)
 *
 *		NPI when TOA is Alternative Address is:
 *
 *		0000 0 Character string coding to ISO/IEC 646.
 *		0001 1 OSI NSAP address coded per X.213/ISO 8348.
 *		0010 2 MAC address per IEEE 802.
 *		0011 3 Internet Address per RFC 1166. (i.e. an IPv4 address)
 *
 *
 * lsap_add:	The DTE address, LSAP or PVC_LCI as two BCD digtis per byte,
 *		right justified.

/* From Solstice X.25 documentation:
 *
 * Addressing is defined by the xaddrf structure.  The members of the xaddrf
 * structure are:
 *
 * link_id:	Holds the link number as a uint32_t.  By default, link_id has
 *		a value of 0xFF.  When link_id is 0xFF, X.25 attempts to match
 *		the called address with an entry in a routing configuration
 *		file.  If it cannot find a match, it routes the call over the
 *		lowest numbered WAN link.
 *
 *		Note that IRIS SX.25 uses sn_id here instead of link_id.
 *
 * aflags:	Specifies the options required or used by the subnetwork to
 *		encode and interpret addresses.  These take on of these values:
 *
 *		NSAP_ADDR   0x00    NSAP field contains OSI-encoded NSAP
 *				    address.
 *		EXT_ADDR    0x01    NSAP field contains non-OSI-encoded
 *				    extended address.
 *		PVC_LCI	    0x02    NSAP field contains a PVC number.
 *
 *		When the NSAP field is empty, aflags has the value 0.
 *
 * DTE_MAC:	The DTE address or LSAP as two BCD digits per byte, right
 *		justified, or the PVC_LCI as three BCD digits with two digits
 *		per byte, right justified.
 *
 * nsap_len:	The length in semi-octets of the NSAP as two BCD digits per
 *		byte, right justified.
 *
 * NSAP:	The NSAP or address extension (see aflags) as two BCD digits
 *		per byte, right justified.
