/*
 * This file includes some specifics for IRIX.  This is amazingly like the
 * Solaris equivalents.  IRIX does not appear to extend the primitive
 * interface.
 */

/*
 * The normal mode of operation is when a bind is performed with the value of
 * the SAP information being in range 0x02 to 0xFE (a one-byte, even value).
 * This is the SAP as specified under 802.2 LLC, and is the only mode of
 * operation for the connection (i.e. LLC2) service mode.  The Sub-Network
 * Access Protocol (SNAP) also uses this mode of operation.
 *
 * The DLSAP address for Normal mode have the following format:
 */
struct llc_dlsap {
	u_char dl_mac[6];		/* hardware address */
	u_char dl_sap;			/* LLC SAP */
};

/*
 * The DSLAP address may be modified through DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ primtive when
 * the SNAP is used to extend the LLC header.  The extended SNAP DLSAP
 * addresses have the following format:
 */
struct llc_snap_dlsap {
	u_char dl_mac[6];		/* hardware address */
	u_char dl_sap;			/* SNAP sap: 0xAA */
	u_char dl_oui[3];		/* OUI information */
	u_char dl_proto[2];		/* protocol ID */
};

/*
 * DSL users should use the llc_dlsap format in constructing the
 * DL_UNITDATA_REQ primitive and it is DLS users' responsibility to put the
 * OUI information and protocol ID in front of their data.  Upon receipt of
 * DL_UNITDATA_IND, the DLSAP addresses are also of llc_dlsap format.  It is
 * DLS users' responsibility to skip the OUI information and protocol ID for
 * users' data.
 *
 * The DLSAP address may also be modified if source routing is used for Token
 * Ring networks through TEST and/or XID primitives.  The source routing
 * information field (rif) is appended to the end of the llc_dlsap format.
 * The DL_CONNECT_* primitives should also use this llc_sri_dlsap format when
 * source routing information is present.  The extended SRI DLSAP addresses
 * have the following format:
 */
struct llc_sri_dlsap {
	u_char dl_mac[6];		/* hardware address */
	u_char dl_sap;			/* LLC SAP */
	u_char dl_rif;			/* start of rif */
};

/*
 * The Ethernet mode of operation occurs when a bind is performed for two
 * bytes (the high byte being non-zero).  When this occurs the binding driver
 * will be sent packets for the Ethernet types registered for.
 *
 * The DLSAP addresses for Ethernet mode have the following format:
 */
struct llc_eth_dlsap {
	u_char dl_mac[6];		/* hardware address */
	u_short dl_sap;			/* Ethernet SAP */
