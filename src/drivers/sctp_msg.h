 *  =========================================================================
 *
 *  SCTP Provider --> SCTP User Interface Primitives
 *
 *  =========================================================================
 *
 *  There must be defined by the specific SCTP User and linked.
 *
 *  CONN_IND:   provides indication of a incoming connection from the peer and
 *              provides a pointer to the connection indication structure
 *              which contains information from the verified cookie in the
 *              COOKIE-ECHO message.  The interface should indicate the
 *              connection to its user and buffer the indication as required.
 *              A return value of non-zero indicates that the interface could
 *              not buffer the connection indication.  Any data received in the
 *              COOKIE-ECHO message will be separately indicated with the
 *              DATA_IND primitive.
 *
 *  CONN_CON:   provides confirmation that the connection has been
 *              established.This is called when a COOKIE-ACK has been
 *              successfully received.  Any data received with the SCTP
 *              message that contained the COOKIE-ACK will be separately
 *              indicated with the data indication primitive.
 *
 *  DATA_IND:   provides indication of data that was received in sequence for
 *              the specified message control block parameters.  The message
 *              control block parameters of interest are PPI, SID, and SSN.
 *              Also, the MORE argument indicates that there are further data
 *              indications that make up the same data record.  The M_DATA
 *              block provided contains a message control block and the data
 *              payload.
 *
 *  DATACK_IND: provides indication that the message with the given message
 *              control block parameters was received in entirety and
 *              positively acknowledged by the peer.  Message control block
 *              parameters of interest include SID and SSN.  Also of interest
 *              might be the per chunk statistics present in the control block
 *              (how many times sent, delay) This only applies to ordered data
 *              unless a token was provided on write.  The M_DATA block
 *              provided contains only a message control block and no data.
 *
 *  RESET_IND:  provids indication that the association has been reset as a
 *              result of an association restart condition.  It also means
 *              that any unacknowledged transmit data will be discarded and
 *              that stream sequence numbers are being reset.
 *
 *  DISCON_IND: provides indication that either an outstanding connection
 *              indication or an existing connection has been abotively
 *              disconnected for the provided reason.  When the CP argument is
 *              included, it identifies the connection indication being
 *              disconnected.  When the CP argument is NULL, the stream to
 *              which the DISCON_IND is sent is the one being disconnected.
 *              In SCTP no data is ever associated with an DISCON_IND.
 *
 *  ORDREL_IND: provides indication that an existing connection has received a
 *              SHUTDOWN or SHUTDOWN-ACK from the peer.
 *
 *  RETR_IND:   provides indication of a retrieved message with the given
 *              message control block parameters.  Message control block
 *              parameters of interest are SID and SSN, STATUS and statistics
 *              associated with the data.  The M_DATA block provided contains
 *              a message control block and the data payload.
 *
 *  RETR_CON:   provides confirmation that all unsent and unacked data has
 *              been retrieved.

 *
 *  SCTP User Interface --> SCTP Provider Primitives
 *
 *  =========================================================================
 *
 *  BIND_REQ:   requests that the provider bind the stream to an SCTP port and address
 *              list and set the requested number of connection indications.  The provider
 *              allocates any necessary resources for binding the stream.
 *
 *  CONN_REQ:   requests that the provider initiate an association with the provided data
 *              (if any).  This will initiate an association by starting the
 *              INIT/INIT-ACK/COOKIE-ECHO/COOKIE-ACK procedure.  The user will either
 *              receive and error number in return, or will receive indication via the
 *              DISCON_IND or CONN_CON callbacks that the connection has failed or was
 *              successful.
 *
 *  CONN_RES:   responds to a previous connection indication from the SCTP provider.  The
 *              connection response includes the conndication indication that was earlier
 *              provided and a pointer to the accepting stream  the accepting stream may
 *              be the same as the responding stream.  Any data provided will be bundled
 *              with the COOKIE-ACK.
 *
 *  DATA_REQ:   requests that the provided data with the provide message control block
 *              parameters be sent on the connection.  Message control block parameters of
 *              interest are PPI, SID, ordered flag, receipt confirmation flag.  The
 *              M_DATA block provided contains a message control block and the data
 *              payload.
 *
 *  DATACK_REQ: requests that the provider acknowledge receipt of a previous DATA_IND with
 *              the given transmit sequence number.  (This will also acknowledge any
 *              previous data fragments that made up the data record that ended with this
 *              TSN.)
 *
 *  RESET_CON:  used to acknowledge a previous reset indication.  This sends a COOKIE ACK
 *              in an SCTP restart scenario.
 *
 *  DISCON_REQ: requests that either the the requesting stream be aborted or that the
 *              connection indication provided by rejected.  This results in an ABORT
 *              being sent.
 *
 *  ORDREL_REQ: request that the SCTP provider accept no more data for transmission on the
 *              connection and inform the other side that it is finished sending data.
 *              This results in a SHUTDOWN or SHUTDOWN-ACK being sent.
 *
 *  UNBIND_REQ: requests that the provider unbind the stream in preparation for having the
 *              stream closed.  The provider frees any and all resources associated with
 *              the stream regardless of what s_state the stream is in.
