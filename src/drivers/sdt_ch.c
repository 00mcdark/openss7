 * This is SDT-CH.  It is a pushable STREAMS module that can be pushed over a CH Stream providing
 * the Channel Interface (CHI) service interface instead of the normal Signalling Data Link
 * Interface (SDLI) service interface as is performed by the regular SDT module.
 *
 * There exists a conversion module (SDL-CH) that will convert a channel into a signalling data link
 * for the purposes of SS7 and using the regular SDT module; however, this approach might be more
 * efficient in the long run.  Performance testing will tell.
