/*
 *  This is an X.233 CLNS driver for RFC 1070 ISO-UDP.
 *
 *  The driver implements X.233 (CLNP) as a pseudo-device driver.  The driver presents an NPI CLNS
 *  service interface to the upper multiplex.  It only provides a CLNS service interface, and only
 *  accepts addresses in the form of RFC 1069/1070.
 *
 *  This driver is implemented as a multiplexing driver.  It supports the linking of multiple NP-UDP
 *  driver Streams bound to UDP Port Number 147.  It will send packets to the same UDP port number
 *  to which the linked Stream is bound.  This must be a provider Stream provided by the np-udp
 *  driver from the strxns package.  Each Stream must be bound before being linked.  Multiple
 *  Streams bound to individual local IP addresses, or a single wildcard IP address bound Stream
 *  (DEFAULT_DESTINATION), can be linked.
 *
 *  The Stream can either be temporarily or permanently linked.  When permanently linked, care
 *  should be taken to unlink the Stream as part of the shutdown procedure, otherwise the driver
 *  will refuse to unload.
 *
 *  Routing is performed with a specialized NSAP address (see RFC 1069, RFC 1070) which includes the
 *  IP address of the peer.  Binding is performed to a specific or wildcard address.  Unitdata
 *  messages are sent to a sepcific IP address.  Source addresses are chosen by the lower multiplex
 *  Stream (outgoing interface for DEFAULT_DESTINATION NP-IP provider Streams, and bound address for
 *  normal NP-IP provider Streams).  Source ports are the same as the port to which the lower Stream
 *  is bound.
 *
 *  This approach is very efficient.  The driver can merely adjust the DEST_offset and DEST_length
 *  in the user provided N_UNITDATA_REQ primitive to create an N_UNITDATA_REQ primitive for the
 *  NP-UDP driver and fill out a portion of the headroom in the associated M_DATA with the CLNP
 *  protocol header.
