This is the fourth public release of the OpenSS7 Master Package.  The sub-packages have been
reorganized for this release.  See README in the release for a sub-package listing.  Aside from
sub-package reorganization, the major difference from previous release is that this release no
longer contains LiS.  Too many of the sub-packages will not even build against LiS because of
its Stream head deficiencies.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Most of the sub-packages in the release are production grade for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  All existing
validation test suites run clean on supported distributions and architectures.  The packages build
better Debian/Ubuntu .deb files.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
It is unlikely that the OpenSS7 Master Package will be released as frequently as before.
Sub-packages will be released more often.  To rebuild the master package with a new sub-package
release, simply replace the directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package
release and then rebuild the master package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):</li>
<ul>
    <li>strnsl-0.9.2.1</li>
    <li>strbcm-0.9.2.2</li>
    <li>striso-0.9.2.1</li>
    <li>strsock-0.9.2.1</li>
    <li>strtty-0.9.2.1</li>
    <li>strutil-0.9.2.4</li>
</ul>
<li>Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text documentation
present in the release directory.</li>
<li>This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp drivers at the 2006 SCTP Interop
at the University of British Columbia.  This version was interoperability tested with all
implementations present.</li>
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new --with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>
</ul><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<em>This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it deprecates previous
