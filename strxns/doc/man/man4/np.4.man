.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The current
.B NP
pseudo-device driver hooks directly into the Linux kernel networking
subsystem.  Previous approaches used a STREAMS over Sockets method that was
inefficient and inflexible.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
Not many

system provide any NPI drivers whatsoever.  Most normally skip from the DLPI
level to the TPI level.
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[

.]
at one point used to provide an NPI interface and sockets support for npi
drivers; however, its use appears deprecated in contemporary releases.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The NPI interfaces to networking services are implementation dependent and are
not subject to standardization.  The ISO NPI interfaces, provided by this
driver conform to the ISO specifications.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
.I STREAMS
access to networking services was originally performed using a STREAMS over
Socket approach using the
.BR INET (4)
pseudo-device driver from the
.I stinet
package.  A more flexible direct implementation was performed using a separate
driver that hooks directly into the Linux network subsystems.
