.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B DL_NOTIFY_ACK
reports the successful registration of even notification on a Stream, and
returns the requested and supported events to the DLS user.  This primitive is
issued in response to a
.BR DL_NOTIFY_REQ (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_NOTIFY_ACK .
.TP
.I dl_notifications
conveys the requested and supported notifications.  This can be a bitwise OR or
zero or more of the values listed below.  Each value represents an event that
is supported by the DLS provider.  Events that are not supported by the DLS
provider do not contain the corresponding value.  Each value that was both
requested and supported indicates that one or more notifications using the
.BR DL_NOTIFY_IND (7)
primitive will be provided whenever:
.RS
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_PHYS_ADDR
the physical address
associated with the physical point of attachment (PPA) changes;
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_PROMISC_ON_PHYS
physical promiscious mode is
set on the physical point of attachment (PPA);
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_PROMISC_OFF_PHYS
physical promiscuous mode is
cleared on the physical point of attachment (PPA);
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_LINK_DOWN
the physical link associated
with the physical point of attachment (PPA) goes down;
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_LINK_UP
the physical link associated
with the physical point of attachment (PPA) comes up;
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_AGGR_AVAIL
link aggregation becomes
available for the physical point of attachment (PPA), see
.RI \*(lq COMPATIBILITY \*(rq;
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_AGGR_UNAVAIL
link aggregation becomes
unavailable for the physical point of attachment (PPA), see
.RI \*(lq COMPATIBILITY \*(rq;
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_SDU_SIZE
the maximum SDU size, either
globally or per address, changes on the physical point of attachment (PPA);
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_SPEED
the link speed changes, or
becomes available for the physical point of attachment (PPA);
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_FASTPATH_FLUSH
the fast path information
changes for the physical point of attachment (PPA), see
.RI \*(lq COMPATIBILITY \*(rq;
.TP
.B DL_NOTE_CAPAB_RENEG
capabilities associated with
the physical point of attachment (PPA) are being renegotiated, see
.RI \*(lq COMPATIBILITY \*(rq.

.SH RULES
.PP
After issuing the
.B DL_NOTIFY_ACK
primitive, the DLS provider must generate
.BR DL_NOTIFY_IND (7)
primitives for each requested and supported event when the event occurs.  In
addition, immediately following the
.B DL_NOTIFY_ACK
primitive, the DLS provider must issue a
.BR DL_NOTIFY_IND (7)
primitive indicating the current state of the interface with regard to the
requested events.  That is, if the link is in the down state and the
.B DL_NOTE_LINK_DOWN
event was requested and supported, a
.BR DL_NOTIFY_IND (7)
primitive indicating the
.B DL_NOTE_LINK_DOWN
event must be issued by the DLS provider immediatley following the
.B DL_NOTIFY_ACK
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
.PP
The primitive is valid and issued in response to a
.BR DL_NOTIFY_REQ (7)
in any attached state where another local acknowledgement is not pending.
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
.PP
The new state remains unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B DL_NOTIFY_ACK
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
primitive.  It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.BR _SUN_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file to expose the declarations and structures associated with this primitive.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B DL_NOTIFY_ACK
is compatibible with
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B DL_NOTIFY_ACK
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
primitive that is not part of the DLPI standard.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
It should not be used by portable DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
Before attempting to use the features of the
.BR DL_NOTIFY_REQ (7)
primitive, the DLS user should issue a
.BR DL_NOTIFY_REQ (7)
primitive with the
.I dl_notifications
field set to zero.  If the DLS provider responds with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive with either the
.BR DL_\%BADPRIM " or " DL_\%NOTSUPPORTED
error number, the DLS provider does not recognize, or support, the primitive.
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
does not document values of the
.I dl_notifications
field:
.BR DL_\%NOTE_\%AGGR_\%AVAIL ", " DL_\%NOTE_\%AGGR_\%UNAVAIL ", " DL_\%NOTE_\%FASTPATH_\%FLUSH " and " DL_\%NOTE_\%CAPAB_\%RENEG .
These values should not be used even by
.IR Solaris \(rg
programs.  Link aggregation and IP fast path are not supported by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
drivers, modules, libraries and programs.
.IP \(em
.B DL_NOTIFY_ACK
is provided by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
for source compatibility with DLS Providers and Users written for use with
.IR Solaris \(rg,
and for porting DLS Providers and Users from
.IR Solaris \(rg
to
.IR Linux \(rg.
Binary compatibility is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced may be
removed from the next release.
