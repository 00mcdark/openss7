.SH NAME
.B DL_REPLY_REQ (dl_reply_req_t)
\- this request primitive is passed to the  DLS  Provider  by  the  DLS  User
to  request that a DLSDU be returned  from  a  peer  DLS  Provider  or that
DLSDUs be exchanged between  stations  using acknowledged connectionless mode
data unit exchange procedures.
.SH SYNOPSIS
Consists  of  one  M_PROTO  message  block containing the structure shown
below, followed by one or more M_DATA blocks with one or more bytes of data.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_REPLY_REQ
is passed to the  DLS  Provider  by  the  DLS  User
to  request that a DLSDU be returned  from  a  peer  DLS  Provider  or that
DLSDUs be exchanged between  stations  using acknowledged connectionless mode
data unit exchange procedures.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys DL_REPLY_REQ
.TP
.I dl_correlation
conveys  a  unique  identifier  which  will  be returned in the
DL_REPLY_STATUS_IND   primitive   to  allow  the  DLS  User  to correlate the
status to the appropriate DL_REPLY_REQ primitive.
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_length
conveys  the length of the DLSAP address of the destination DLS User.  If  the
destination user is implemented using DLPI, this address is the full DLSAP
address returned on the DL_BIND_ACK.
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_offset
conveys  the  offset  from the beginning of the M_PROTO message block where
the destination DLSAP address begins.
.TP
.I dl_src_addr_length
conveys the length of the DLSAP address of the source DLS User.
.TP
.I dl_src_addr_offset
conveys  the  offset  from the beginning of the M_PROTO message block where
the source DLSAP address begins.
.TP
.I dl_priority
priority provided for the data unit transmission.
.TP
.I dl_service_class
specifies  whether  or  not  an  acknowledge  capability in the medium  access
control sublayer is to be used for the data unit transmission.
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in state DL_IDLE.
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is unchanged.
.SH RESPONSE
If  the request is erroneous, message DL_ERROR_ACK is returned, and the
resulting  state  is  unchanged.  If  the  message is valid, a
DL_REPLY_STATUS_IND  is returned.  This will indicate the success or failure of
the previous associated acknowledged connectionless-mode data unit exchange.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
The  destination  DLSAP  address  was in an incorrect format or contained
invalid information.
.TP
.B DL_BADDATA
The  amount  of  data  in  the  current  DLSDU exceeded the DLS provider's
DLSDU limit.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
Primitive is valid, but not supported.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_UNSUPPORTED
Requested  service  not  supported  by  Provider  (Request with response at
the Medium Access Control sublayer).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Data Link Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
