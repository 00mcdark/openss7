.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B DL_CONTROL_ACK
is an acknowledgement of the extensible
.BR DL_CONTROL_REQ (7)
primitive that sends down control information to the DLS provider.  The
.B DL_CONTROL_ACK
primitive is issued by the DLS provider in response to a successful control
operation invoked with a
.BR DL_CONTROL_REQ (7)
primitive.
.\"

conveys
.BR DL_CONTROL_ACK .
.TP
.I dl_operation
Conveys the operation that this primitive acknowledges and is the same value as
in the field of the same name in the corresponding
.BR DL_CONTROL_REQ (7)
primitive to which this primitive is a response.  This field can have one of
the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B DL_CO_ADD
A new entry was added for

.RI < type >
and
.RI < key >
and data
.RI < data >
was deleted.
.TP
.B DL_CO_FLUSH
All entries of type
.RI < type >
were deleted.
.TP
.B DL_CO_GET
The data for

.RI < key >
was retrieved and appears in the data
.RI < data >.
.TP
.B DL_CO_UPDATE
An existing entry was updated for

.RE
.TP
.I dl_type
Conveys the
.RI < type >
of control and is the same value as in the field of the same
name in the corresponding
.BR DL_CONTROL_REQ (7)
primitive to which this primitive is a response.  This field can have one of
the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B DL_CT_IPSEC_AH
The
.RI < key >
is the Security Parameters Index (SPI) and destination IP address
using a
.B dl_ct_ipsec_key_t
structure, the
.RI < data >
is keyring material conveyed using a
.B dl_ct_ipsec_t
structure.
.TP
.B DL_CT_IPSEC_ESP
The
.RI < key >
is the Security Parameters Index (SPI) and destination transport
address using a
.B dl_ct_ipsec_key_t
structure, the
.RI < data >
is keyring material conveyed using a
.B dl_ct_ipsec_t
structure.

.PP
.B DL_CONTROL_ACK
is a

before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file,
or it might be necessary to include the
.RB < sys/dlpi_sun.h >
header file,
to expose the declarations and structures associated with this primitive.
