.TH DL_ATTACH_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)"
.SH NAME
.B DL_ATTACH_REQ (dl_attach_req_t)
\- requests the DLS provider associate a physical point of
attachment (PPA) with astream.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
Data Link Provider Interface, DLPI.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one M_PROTO message block, which contains the
following structure.
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
#include <sys/dlpi.h>

typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_ppa;
} dl_attach_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_ATTACH_REQ
is needed for style 2 DLS providers to identify the physical
medium over which communication will transpire.  The request may not be
issued to a style 1 DLS provider; doing so may cause errors.
.PP
The DLS provider may initialize the physical line on receipt of this
primitive or the
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7).
Otherwise, the line must be initialized
through some management mechanism before this request is issued by the DLS
user.  Either way, the physical link must be initialized and ready for use
on successful completion of the
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The
.B dl_attach_req_t
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_ppa
conveys the identifier of the physical point of attachment to be associated
with the stream.  The format of the identifier is provider-specific, and it
must contain sufficient information to distinguish the desired PPA from
all possible PPAs on a system.  At a minimum, this must include
identification of the physical medium over which communication will
transpire.  For media that multiplex multiple channels over a single physical
medium, this identifier should also specify a specific channel to be used
for communication (where each channel on a physical medium is associated with
a separate PPA).

Because of the provider-specific nature of this value, DLS user software that
is to be protocol independent should avoid hard-coding the PPA
identifier.  The DLS user should retrieve the necessary PPA identifier from
some other entity (such as a management entity) and insert it without
inspection into the
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ .
.\"
.\"
.SH MODE
This primitive is valid in
any
mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
The message is valid in state
.BR DL_UNATTACHED ,
but only when local acknowledgement of a request or response primitive is not
pending for the requesting Stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.BR DL_ATTACH_PENDING .
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
If the attach request is successful,
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS user
resulting in state
.BR DL_UNBOUND .
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting state is unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
One of the following errors may be returned in the
.B DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive:
.TP
.B DL_ACCESS
The DLS user did not have proper permission to use the requested PPA.
.TP
.B DL_BADPPA
The specified PPA is invalid.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_INITFAILED
Automatic initialization of the PPA failed.
.TP
.B DL_NOTINIT
The PPA had not been initialized prior to this request.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in
the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
See
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
for a description of specific Linux error codes applicable to DLPI.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B DL_ATTACH_REQ
primitive is compatible with implementations based on DLPI Revision 2,
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
such as
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixdlpi
.]
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.[
hpuxdlpi
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
soldoc11
.]
.IR Solstice \(rg,
.[
solx25pg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7doc
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Each implementation of DLPI manages its own Physical Point of Attachment (PPA)
address space in different ways.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
encodes the framing and Linux system interface index in a composite PPA.  When
porting programs from another implementation to
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" ,
it may be necessary to make modifications to the way in which the PPA is
managed or passed to the application.
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxdlpi
.]
provides a non-standard primitive,
.BR DL_HP_PPA_REQ (7)
that can be used to obtain a PPA.  It also provides a
.BR lanscan ()
utility that lists the available PPAs in the system.
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxdlpi
.]
documents UNIX error codes (listed in the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
reference page).  Other implementations do not document these codes.  Portable
programs will not rely upon the specific value of a Linux error code for proper
operation.
.IP \(em
The DLPI error codes
.BR DL_NOTINIT " and " DL_INITFAILED
are not documented by the DLPI standard,
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
but are implied by the text of the standard.  Portable DLPI applications should
be prepared to receive any DLPI non-fatal error code in reply to any request or
response primitive.
.IP \(em
.IR Solstice \(rg
.[
solx25pg
.]
documents that LAPB PPAs are defined at system configuration time using the
.BR L_SETPPA (4)
input-output control, whereas LLC2 PPAs are associated with the hardware at
system boot time.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
LLC2 driver,
.BR llc2 (4),
uses the Linux device index as the PPA.  The LAPB driver,
.BR lapb (4),
uses the Linux device index or input-output controls to establish the PPA.
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg
LAPB
.[
aixlink
.]
does not support this primitive.
.PP
See
.BR dlpi (7),
.BR dlpi_ioctl (4),
.BR STREAMS (9),
for additional compatibility information.
