The message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block, that contains the following structure:
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
#include <sys/dlpi.h>
#include <sys/dlpi_ext.h>

typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t dl_primitive;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B DL_HP_MULTICAST_LIST_ACK
primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_HP_MULTICAST_LIST_ACK .
.TP
.I dl_offset
indicates the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the multicast addresses begin.
.TP
.I dl_length
indicates the length of the multicast addresses, in octets.
.TP
.I dl_count
indicates the total number of 6-octet multicast addresses in the data area of
the multicast acknowledgement.
.\"
.\"
.SH MODE
This primitive is valid in
any
mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
.PP
The message is valid in any state in which a local acknowledgement is not
pending and in response to an issued
.BR DL_HP_MULTICAST_REQ (7)
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
.PP
The resulting state remains the same.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B DL_HP_MULTICAST_LIST_ACK
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
primitive.  It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.BR _HPUX_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.  Also, it might be necessary to include the
.RB < sys/dlpi_ext.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B DL_HP_MULTICAST_LIST_ACK
is compatible with

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B DL_HP_MULTICAST_LIST_ACK
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
pirmitive that is not part of the DLPI standard.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0

It should not be used by portable DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
.B DL_HP_MULTICAST_LIST_ACK
is provided by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
for source compatibility with DLS Providers and Users written for use with

Binary compatibility is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced may be
removed from the next release.
