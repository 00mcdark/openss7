.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/npi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/npi_ip.h>
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B NPI-IP
provides a Stream supporting the Network Provider Interface,
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
to the Internet Protocol,
.BR ip (7).
This
.IR STREAMS (4)
interface provides the
.BR ip (7)
protocol service interface using the N-primitives of the
.BR npi (7).
This interface is intended solely for use by user programs or protocol modules
requiring the common
.BR npi (7)
interface, such as the
.BR xti (3)
and
.BR sockets (3)
library.
.\"
.SS "Address Formats"
.PP
For consistency with other protocol modules, the address format used by
.B NPI-IP
is a Internet Protocol socket address
.RB ( sockaddr_in
structure)
in address family
.B AF_INET
or
.RB ( sockaddr_in6
structure)
in address family
.BR AF_INET6 .
The
.B sockaddr_in
structure is described in
.BR ip (7).
The
.B sockaddr_in6
structure is described in
.BR ipv6 (7).
.PP
.B NPI-IP
supports the notion of multihoming in support of the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
.[
rfc2960
.]
described in
.BR sctp (7).
SCTP requires that an association be bound to multiple IP or IPv6 addresses.
In support of multihoming,
.B NPI-IP
permits multiple addresses to be specified to bind.  When multiple addresses
are required, they are specified as a special packed list of
.BR sockaddr_in  " or " sockaddr_in6
structures.  The list forms the address specified using the
.IR ADDR_length " and " ADDR_offset
fields in the
.BR N_INFO_ACK (7),
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
and
.BR N_BIND_ACK (7)
primitives.
.PP
For IPv4, the format of the address is a
.BR sockaddr_in
structure followed by an array of
.I sin_addr
members.  This is a
.B sockaddr_ina
structure defined as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct sockaddr_ina {
    unsigned short sin_family;
    unsigned short sin_port;
    struct in_addr sin_addr[];
};

.SS "Local Management Interface"
.PP
For the most part, the local management interface of the NPI operates for the
NPI-IP provider in accordance with the Network Provider Interface Revision
2.0.0 specifications.
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
Some enhancements are provided to addressing in support of the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
.[

.PP
The local management primitives are interpreted and issued as
follows:
.TP
.BR N_INFO_REQ (7)
This primitive is interpreted by the NPI-IP provider in accordance with the
NPI specifications.
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0

.TP
.BR N_INFO_ACK (7)
This primitive is issued by the NPI-IP provider in accordances with the NPI
specifications
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
with the following considerations:
.RS
.TP
.I NSDU_size
This field reflects the current Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) (minus the size of
the IP header), times the number of IP packets that can be generated
considering IP fragmentation, for the Stream given the protocol addresses to
which the Stream is bound.
.TP
.I ENSDU_size
The NPI-IP provider, being a CLNS provider, has no concept of expedited data
and this field is always set to zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.TP
.I CDATA_size
The NPI-IP provider, being a CLNS proivder, has no concept of connection data
and this field is always set to zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.TP
.I DDATA_size
The NPI-IP provider, being a CLNS proivder, has no concept of connection data
and this field is always set to zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.TP
.I ADDR_size
Specifies the maximum address size.  For a device that supports IPv4, this is
the size of the
.B sockaddr_in
structure.  For an NPI-IP provider supporting multihoming, this value will
be an integer multiple of the size of the
.B sockaddr_in
structure.  For a device that supports IPv6, the size of the
.B sockaddr_in6
structure, or, supprorting multihoming, an integer multiple.
.TP
.IR ADDR_length " and " ADDR_offset
The length and offset of the bound protocol addresses.  For an NPI-IP provider
supporting multihoming, the length and offset specify a list of address
structures as described above under
.RB \*(lq "Address Formats" \*(rq.
.TP
.IR QOS_length " and " QOS_offset
The length and offset of the current selected QOS parameters.  This will be an
.B N_QOS_CL_SEL1
structure completed as described above under
.RB \*(lq "QOS Parameters" .\*(rq
It may be necessary to bind a Stream before a value will be returned in the
information acknowledgement.
.TP
.IR QOS_range_length " and " QOS_range_offset
The length and offset of the current range of QOS parameters.  This will be an
.B N_QOS_CL_RANGE1
structure completed as described above under
.RB \*(lq "QOS Parameters" .\*(rq
It may be necessary to bind a Stream before a value will be returned in the
information acknowledgement.
.TP
.I OPTIONS_flags
The NPI-IP provider sets no options flags and this field is always set to zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.TP
.I NIDU_size
The NPI-IP provider, being a CLNS proivder, has no concept of interface data
unit size
and this field is always set to zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.TP
.I SERV_type
The NPI-IP provider always sets this field to
.B N_CLNS
for connectionless network service.
.TP
.I CURRENT_state
Indicates the current state of the NPI provider in accordance with the NPI
specifications.
.TP
.I PROVIDER_type
The NPI-IP proivder always sets this field to
.B N_SNICFP
for Subnetwork Independent Convergence Function/Protocol.
.TP
.I NODU_size
This field reflects the current Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) (minus the size of
the IP header) for the Stream given the protocol address to which the Stream
is bound.  Sending a packet using the
.BR N_UNITDATA_REQ
primitive with a data payload of less than or equal to this size will not
normally result in IP fragmentation.
.TP
.IR PROTOID_length " and " PROTOID_offset
The length and offset of the bound protocol identifiers.
.TP
.I NPI_version
The NPI-IP always sets this field to
.B N_VERSION_2
to indicat Network Provider Interface Revision 2.0.0.

Typically in NPI the network address consists of a single address.  In support
of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), the

This flag is honored by NPI-IP.  When set, this flag indicates that this
Stream is the \*(lqdefault destination Stream.\*(rq  This Stream will receive
all packets destined for the NSAP specified in the bind request.  If no NSAP
is specified in the bind request, then this Stream should receive all packets
destined to an NSAP which is bound to no other Stream.  Only one default
destination Stream per NSAP is allowed per occurrence of NPI.  An attempt to
bind a default destination Stream to an NSAP when one is already bound should
result in an error of type
.BR NBOUND .
.RE
.TP
.IR PROTOID_length ", " PROTOID_offset
Specifies the length in bytes of the protocol ids and the offset from the
beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the protocol ids begin.  Protocol ids for NPI-IP consist
of IP protocol numbers.  Typically only one IP protocol number is bound in a
given bind request.
.RE
.TP
.BR N_BIND_ACK (7)
The bind acknowledgement primitive is issued in accordance with the NPI
specifications.  When a multihomed address was specified to the bind, the
.IR ADDR_length " and " ADDR_offset
fields may specify a bound address that consists of a list of addresses as
indicated under
.RB \*(lq "ADDRESS FORMATS" ,\*(rq
above.
.RS
.PP
If no address was specified to the bind, the NPI-IP provider will assume that
all local addresses are to be bound.  The NPI-IP provider also respects the
.B INADDR_ANY
value in the address, as well as the special port number zero (0).
.RE
.TP
.BR N_UNBIND_REQ (7)
The unbind request primitive is interpreted by the NPI-IP provider in

.SS "Connectionless Data Transfer"
.PP
The NPI-IP provider is a CLNS (Connectionless Network Service) provider that
uses the connectionless data transfer N-primitives to transfer data.  For the
most part, these primitives are used in strict accordance with the NPI
specifications.
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0

Some enhancements are provided to addressing in support of the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
.[

.PP
The connectionless data transfer primitives are interpreted and issued as
follows:
.TP
.BR N_UNITDATA_REQ (7)
This primitive is interpreted by the NPI-IP provider as specified in the NPI specification.
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
.RS
.TP
.IR DEST_length " and " DEST_offset
These fields are interpreted as the destination address for the IP packet.
The specified address must be a single address and cannot contain a list.
.TP
.IR RESERVED_Field "[0] and " RESERVED_field [1]
These fields are reserved for DLPI

compatibility and are normally set to zero.  For multihomed hosts in support
of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP),
.[
rfc2960
.]
and when the Stream is bound to multiple addresses, these fields can be
treated as
.IR SRC_length " and " SRC_offset
fields and used to specify the source address for the outgoing packet.
The source address specified must normally be one of the addresses to which the
Stream is bound.  If not, the NPI-IP provider may return the
.B NBADADDR
error in a
.BR N_UDERROR_IND (7)
primitive.
If a source address is not specified (i.e.
.I SRC_length
is zero), then the NPI-IP provider will select a source address from those to
which the Stream was bound.
If only one address was bound, these fields are ignored and the NPI-IP provider
will use the bound address as the source address for the packet.
.PP
In addition to the normal use of the
.BR N_UNITDATA_REQ (7)
primitive, the primitive can be used to return a message delivered to the
NPI-IP NS User with the
.BR N_UNITDATA_IND (7)
primitive.  This is accomplished by simply changing the
.I PRIM_type
from
.B N_UNITDATA_IND
to
.B N_UNITDATA_REQ
and passing the message back downstream.  The NPI-IP NS Provider will detect
that the destination address is one of the addresses bound to the Stream and
will pass the message to any other Linux IP user registered against the
protocol ID, if there is no other Linux IP user registered against the
protocol ID, these messages are simply discarded.

In pseudo-connection-oriented mode, the NPI-IP user transfers data using the
.BR N_DATA_REQ (7)
primitive.  When the destination host is multi-homed, the data will be sent to
the primary destination address.  The current primary destination address can
be changed with the
.BR N_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive.  The source address on the IP packet will be one of the addresses
associated with the route and the outgoing interface.

There are a number of purposes for this NPI-IP driver:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The
.I OpenSS7 Project
has a need for a solution for providing a pseudo-device driver for RTP (Real-Time Transport
Protocol).
.[
rfc1889
.]
Because RTP runs over UDP (User Datagram Protocol), it is necessary to intercept packets
ahead of Linux' native UDP at the IP level to avoid the inefficiencies of opening Sockets from
inside the kernel.  This NPI-IP driver accomplishes that feat.  It also permits a single Stream to
be opened but which communicates on many RTP channels.
.IP 2.
The
.I OpenSS7 Project
has a need for a direct interface and interception (drop and insert) capabilities at the IP level
for the purposes of testing both RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)
.[
rfc1889
.]
and SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol).
.[
rfc2960
.]
This need is less critical because of the availability of Ferry-Clip
testing, using STREAMS-based pipes, that can be rigged to RTP and SCTP to acheive the same effect.
.IP 3.
Although historically the STREAMS SCTP driver hooks directly to the Linux native IP subsystem at the
driver-kernel level, it might be of some advantage to make SCTP a pushable module that simply pushes
over one of these NPI-IP Streams, or a multiplexing driver under which one of these NPI-IP Streams
is permanently linked at system initialization.  The ability to bind multiple addresses is of use to
SCTP.
.IP 4.
Although there is no prevailing standardized way of interfacing to the IP layer of various
.IR UNIX \(rg
operating systems, such as
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
soldoc
.]
it might be possible to make the
.I OpenSS7 Project
RTP and SCTP drivers immediately portable to other operating systems with STREAMS such as
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR pSOS \(rg,
.IR vxWorks \(rg,
.IR LynxOS \(rg,
etc. by simply porting the NPI-IP driver instead of each protocol driver.

There is, in fact, no standard for using the Network Provider Interface (NPI)

various releases of the
