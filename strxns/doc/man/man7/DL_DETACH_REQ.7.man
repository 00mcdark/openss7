.SH NAME
.B DL_DETACH_REQ (dl_detach_req_t)
\- for style 2 DLS providers, this requests the DLS provider detach a
physical point of attachment (PPA) from a stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
Data Link Provider Interface, DLPI.
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, which contains the following structure.
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
#include <sys/dlpi.h>

typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
} dl_detach_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
For style 2 DLS providers, this requests the DLS provider detach a
physical point of attachment (PPA) from a stream.  The request may not be
issued to a style 1 DLS provider; doing so may cause errors.
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_DETACH_REQ .
.\"
.\"
.SH MODE
This primitive is valid in
any
mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
The message is valid in state
.BR DL_UNBOUND .
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.BR DL_DETACH_PENDING .
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
If the detach request is successful,
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS user resulting in state
.BR DL_UNATTACHED .
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting state is unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
One of the following errors may be returned in the
.B DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive:
.TP 16
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in
the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
See
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
for a description of specific Linux error codes applicable to DLPI.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B DL_DETACH_REQ
primitive is compatible with implementations based on DLPI Revision 2,
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
such as
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixdlpi
.]
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.[
hpuxdlpi
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
soldoc11
.]
.IR Solstice \(rg,
.[
solx25pg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7doc
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The implementations are rather inconsistent in their error handling of this
primitive when it is issued on a
.B DL_STYLE1
DLS provider.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
returns a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
with the error code
.BR DL_NOTSUPPORTED .
.IR HP-UX \(rg
appears to return
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
with
.B DL_SYSERR
and
.RB [ ENOTSUP ].
Other are not clear.
.RS
.PP
Portable programs will not issue
.BR DL_DETACH_REQ
on a
.B DL_STYLE1
Stream.
.RE
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxdlpi
.]
documents the UNIX error codes (listed as Linux error codes above).  Other
implementations do not document these codes.  Portable programs will not rely
upon the specific value of a Linux error code for proper operation.
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg
LAPB
.[
aixlink
.]
does not support this primitive.
.PP
See
.BR dlpi (7),
.BR dlpi_ioctl (4),
.BR STREAMS (9),
for additional compatibility information.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
This interface conforms to DLPI Revision 2.

dlpi revision 2.0.0
