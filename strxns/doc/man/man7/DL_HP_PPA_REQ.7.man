.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The message consists of one
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, that contains the following structure:
.sp
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
#include <sys/dlpi.h>
#include <sys/dlpi_ext.h>

typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t dl_primitive;
} dl_hp_ppa_req_t;

.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B DL_HP_PPA_REQ
primitive is used to obtain a list of all of the valid Physical Points of
Attachment (PPA) currently installed in the system and known to the DLS
provider.  The primitive requests that the DLS provider assemble a list of all
PPA known to the provider and acknowledge successful receipt of the primitive
by issuing a
.BR DL_HP_PPA_ACK (7)
primitive containing the list of PPA and PPA associated information.
.\"
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_HP_PPA_REQ .
.\"
.\"
.SH MODE
This primitive is valid in
any
mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
.PP
The message is valid in any state in which a local acknowledgement is no
pending for the requesting Stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEW STATE"
.PP
The resulting DLPI state remains the same.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
If the request is successful, the DLS provider issues a
.BR DL_HP_PPA_ACK (7)
to the DLS user acknowledging successful receipt of the primitive, and
containing the list of installed PPA.
If the request fails, the DLS provider issues a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
acknowledging unsuccessful receipt of the primitive providing the reason for
failure.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When a
.B DL_HP_PPA_REQ
primitive received by the DLS provider is unsuccessful due to a non-fatal
error, the DLS provider issues a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive containing the reason for the non-fatal error in the
.IR dl_errno " and " dl_unix_errno
fields of that primitive.  The
.B DL_HP_PPA_REQ
primitive can fail because:
.TP 16
.B DL_ACCESS
The DLS user did not have proper permission to make the request.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.TP
.B DL_BADPRIM
The DLS provider does not recognize the
.B DL_HP_PPA_REQ
primitive.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
The DLS provider recognizes the
.B DL_HP_PPA_REQ
primitive, but does not support the primitive.
.PP
See also,
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B DL_HP_PPA_REQ
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
primitive.  It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.BR _HPUX_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.  Also, it might be necessary to include the
.RB < sys/dlpi_ext.h >
header file to expose the definitions and structures associated with this
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B DL_HP_PPA_REQ
is compatibible with
