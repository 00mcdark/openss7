.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dlpi_unbind
is a DLPI Library
.[
soldoc11
.]
subroutine that requests that the DLS provider unbind the DLPI stream associated with the DLPI
handle.
.PP
This function is only valid in the \fB\)DL_IDLE\fP state.  Upon successful completion, the new state
is \fB\)DL_UNBOUND\fP.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B dlpi_unbind
function, include
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
and
.RB < dlpi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -ldlpi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B dlpi_unbind
function or include the
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.a
static library object as an target of the linking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B dlpi_unbind
is fully thread-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B dlpi_unbind
is successful, it returns \fB\)DLPI_SUCCESS\fP.
When
.B dlpi_unbind
fails, it returns a DLPI or DLPI Library error code.  When the DLPI error code is \fB\)DL_SYSERR\fP,
the error is contained in the \fIerrno\fP(3) global variable.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B dlpi_unbind
fails, it returns a a DLPI, DLPI Library or system error code.
.B dlpi_unbind
may fail when:
.PP
The following DLPI Library errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ DLPI_EINHANDLE ]
The DLPI handle, \fIdh\fP, is not a valid data link handle.
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ DLPI_EBADMSG ]
Received a bad or unexpected DLPI message.
.TP
.RB [ DLPI_ETIMEDOUT ]
The operation timed out awaiting an acknowledgement.
.PD
.PP
The following DLPI errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ DL_OUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ DL_SYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the \fBLinux\fP system error code is indicated in the
.IR errno (3)
global variable.
.PD
.PP
The following \fBLinux\fP system errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ EPERM ]
Fine-grained permission for the request is incorrect.
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
Insufficient memory was immediately available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
Insufficient buffers were immediately available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
Insufficient \fISTREAMS\fP resources were available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
A temporary failure occured and the DLS user should reissue the request.
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
The control information in the request has already been subjected to the
control request or a transient condition prevented the request.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
On of the parameters of the requst for which there is no prescribed error code
has an invalid value.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTSUP ]
The request is recognized by not supported.
.TP
.RB [ ENOLINK ]
The interface, Physical Point of Attachment, or underlying driver or device, is
not connected.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
Invalid device.  The interface, Physical Point of Attachment, or underlying
driver or device is no longer installed on the system.
.PD
.PP
In addition, any of the error numbers returned by
.BR putmsg (2s)
or
.BR getmsg (2s)
may also be returned in \fIerrno\fP(3) when
.B dlpi_unbind
returns \fBDL_SYSERR\fP.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B dlpi_unbind
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor symbol,
.BR _SUN_SOURCE ,
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file, to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations
necessary for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < dlpi.h >
header file
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B dlpi_unbind
is compatible with the
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
.[
soldoc11
.]
and systems providing an interface equivalent to
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B DLPI Library
functions are
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
applications programs, drivers and modules to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the DLPI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
.PP
