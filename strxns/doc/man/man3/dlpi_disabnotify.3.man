.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dlpi_disabnotify
is a DLPI Library
.[
soldoc11
.]
subroutine that requests that the DLS provider cancel notifications and
invocation of the associated callback functions identified by the handle,
\fIid\fP, when events occur.  When \fIargp\fP is \fBNULL\fP it is ignored, but
when non-\fBNULL\fP, the argument that was associated with the callback function
using the \fBdlpi_enabnotify\fP(3) library call will be returned in the area
pointed to by \fIargp\fP.
.PP
Multiple notification callbacks can be active at a given point in time for a
given DLPI Stream.  The notification identifier, \fIid\fP, retured by the
\fBdlpi_enabnotify\fP(3) library call is used to distinguish between callback
function registrations.  Once enabled, a notification callback function will be
invoked for each registered event until the DLPI Stream is closed, or the
notification callback is deregistered with \fBdlpi_disabnotify\fP.
.PP
Note that \fBdlpi_notifyid_t\fP is opaque to the DLPI library user, but can be
treated as a \fB(void *)\fP type.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B dlpi_disabnotify
function, include
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
and
.RB < dlpi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -ldlpi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B dlpi_disabnotify
function or include the
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.a
static library object as an target of the linking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B dlpi_disabnotify
is fully thread-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B dlpi_disabnotify
is successful, it returns \fBDLPI_SUCCESS\fP, and, when non-\fBNULL\fP, the
argument associated with the notification callback function is stored in the
area pointed to by \fIargp\fP.
When
.B dlpi_disabnotify
fails, it returns a DLPI or DLPI Library error code.  When the DLPI error code
is \fBDL_SYSERR\fP, the error is contained in the \fIerrno\fP(3) global
variable.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B dlpi_disabnotify
fails, it returns a DLPI, DLPI Library or system error code.
.B dlpi_disabnotify
may fail when:
.PP
The following DLPI Library errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDLPI_ENOTEIDINVAL\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ DLPI_EINHANDLE ]

.\"Received a bad or unexpected DLPI message.
.TP
.RB [ DLPI_ETIMEDOUT ]
The operation timed out awaiting an acknowledgement.
.TP
.RB [ DLPI_FAILURE ]
Recovery from a failed DLPI operation failed.
.PD
.PP
The following DLPI errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDLPI_ENOTEIDINVAL\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ DL_ACCESS ]
The DLS user did not have proper permission to make the request.
.PD 0
.\".TP
.\".RB [ DL_OUTSTATE ]
.\"The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ DL_BADPRIM ]

.TP
.RB [ DL_NOTSUPPORTED ]
The DLS provider recognizes, but does support, \fB\)DL_NOTIFY_REQ\fP(7).
.TP
.RB [ DL_SYSERR ]
A system error occurred and the \fBLinux\fP system error code is in the
\fIerrno\fP(3) global variable.
.PD
.PP
The following \fBLinux\fP system errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDLPI_ENOTEIDINVAL\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ EPERM ]
Fine-grained permission for the request is incorrect.
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
Insufficient memory was immediately available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
Insufficient buffers were immediately available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
Insufficient \fISTREAMS\fP resources were available to satisfy the request.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
A temporary failure occured and the DLS user should reissue the request.
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
The control information in the request has already been subjected to the
control request or a transient condition prevented the request.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
On of the parameters of the requst for which there is no prescribed error code
has an invalid value.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTSUP ]
The request is recognized by not supported.
.TP
.RB [ ENOLINK ]
The interface, Physical Point of Attachment, or underlying driver or device, is
not connected.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
Invalid device.  The interface, Physical Point of Attachment, or underlying
driver or device is no longer installed on the system.
.PD
.PP
In addition, any of the error numbers returned by
.BR putmsg (2s)
or
.BR getmsg (2s)
may also be returned in \fIerrno\fP(3) when
.B dlpi_disabnotify
returns \fBDL_SYSERR\fP.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B dlpi_disabnotify
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor symbol,
.BR _SUN_SOURCE ,
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file, to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations
necessary for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < dlpi.h >
header file
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B dlpi_disabnotify
is compatible with the
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
.[
soldoc11
.]
and systems providing an interface equivalent to
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B DLPI Library
functions are
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
applications programs, drivers and modules to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the DLPI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
