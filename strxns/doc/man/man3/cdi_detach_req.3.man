.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B cdi_detach_req
is a CDI API Library
.[
cdiapi
.]
subroutine.
It issues a \fB\)CD_DETACH_REQ\fP(7) primitive on the NPI Stream specified by
file descriptor, \fIfd\fP, and awaits and processes either a
\fB\)CD_OK_ACK\fP(7) primitive acknowledging the attachment, or a
\fB\)CD_ERROR_ACK\fP(7) primitive negatively acknolwedging the attachment.
.BR cdi_put_detach_req (3)
is used to issue the
.BR CD_DETACH_REQ (7)
primitive, and
.BR cdi_wait_ack (3)
is used to await and process the acknowlegement.
.PP
When the operation is positively or negatively acknowledged, upon return, the
area pointed to tbe \fIstate_ptr\fP, when non-\fBNULL\fP, will contian the CDS
provider's current view of the state of the interface.
.PP
This library call is only valid in the \fB\)CD_DISABLED\fP state.  The next
state of the interface upon successful completion is the \fB\)CD_UNATTACHED\fP
state.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B cdi_detach_req
function, include
.RB < sys/cdi.h >
and
.RB < cdiapi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -lcdiapi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B cdi_detach_req
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B cdi_detach_req
is fully thread-safe.
What is described as global variables are in fact thread-specific data when
linked with
.BR libpthread .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B cdi_detach_req
is successful, it returns zero (0) or a positive integer value.
When
.B cdi_detach_req
fails, it returns a negative integer value (-1).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B cdi_detach_req
is unsuccessful or fails, it returns zero (0) or a negative integer value (-1).
.B cdi_detach_req
is unsuccessful or fails when:
.PP
A CDI provider error occurs:
.TP \w'[\fBCD_PROTOSHORT\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ CD_BADPRIM ]
unrecognized primitive.
.TP
.RB [ CD_EVENT ]
protocol-specific event occured.
.TP
.RB [ CD_FATALERR ]
device has become unusable.
.TP
.RB [ CD_NOTSUPP ]
primitive not supported by this device.
.TP
.RB [ CD_OUTSTATE ]
primitive was issued form an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ CD_PROTOSHORT ]
\fBM_PROTO\fP(9) block too short.
.TP
.RB [ CD_SYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fP system error occurred and the \fBLinux\fP system error code is
contained in the \fIerrno\fP(3) global variable.
.PP
A \fBLinux\fP system error occurs:
.TP \w'[\fB\)CD_PROTOSHORT\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ ELIBACC ]
The CDI API library was not initialized.  See \fBcdi_init\fP(3).
.TP
.RB [ EBADF ]
the file descriptor, \fIfd\fP, supplied does not correspond to a valid CDI
Stream open for reading and writing.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
one or more of the arguments are invalid.
.TP
.RB [ ETIMEDOUT ]
the call timed out awaiting a \fB\)CD_OK_ACK\fP(7) or \fB\)CD_ERROR_ACK\fP(7)
primitive.  The default time for which these primitives are awaited is
\fB100\fP milliseconds.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
the call was interrupted by a signal before it could complete.
.TP
.RB [ ERESTART ]
the call was interrupted by a signal before it could begin.
.TP
.RB [ ERESTARTSYS ]
See [\fBERESTART\fP].
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
the call was non-blocking and a message was not immediately available or
flow control was in effect.
.TP
.RB [ EBADMSG ]
a message of the incorrect type was waiting on the Stream.
.PP
In addition, any of the error number returned by
.BR cdi_put_proto (3)
or
.BR cdi_wait_ack (3)
can be returned by
.BR cdi_detach_req .

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B cdi_detach_req
is a
.IR GCOM -specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor symbol,
.BR _GCOM_SOURCE ,
before including the
.RB < sys/cdi.h >
header file,
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < cdiapi.h >
header file
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B cdi_detach_req
is compatible with the
.I GCOM
CDI API Library,
.[
npiapi
.]
and system providing an interface equivalent to the
.I GCOM
CDI API Library,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B CDI API Library
functions are
.IR GCOM -specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR GCOM
software to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
CDI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the CDI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
.PP
