.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dlpi_set_timeout
is a DLPI Library
.[
soldoc11
.]
subroutine.
.PP
When the DLPI Library performs DLPI operations it passes DLPI primtives,
.BR dlpi (7),
to and from the DLS provider.  When a primitive is passed to the DLS provider by
the DLPI Library and an acknowledgement is expected from the DLS provider, the
DLPI Library uses a timer to guard against the lack of a response form the DLS
provider.  The time interval that the DLPI Library will wait for such an
acknolwedgement defaults at the time that a given DLPI Stream is opended with
\fIdlpi_open\fP(3) to 100 milliseconds.  This function sets the time interval to
some other value in seconds.
.PP
When \fIseconds\fP is set to zero (0), it means that the DLPI Library will
return with the error \fB\)DLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fP if the acknowledgement is not
immediately available.  This value is not recommended as it can lead to spurious
\fB\)DLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fP errors.
.PP
When \fIseconds\fP is set to \fB\)DLPI_INF_TIMEOUT\fP (which is minus one (-1)),
it means that the DLPI Library will wait indefinitely for an acknowledgement.
.PP
When \fIseconds\fP is set to a value greater than zero, it specifies the time
interval, in seconds, that the DLPI Library will wait for an acknowledgement
before returning a \fB\)DLPI_ETIMEDOUT\fP error.
.PP
When \fIseconds\fP is set to \fB\)DLPI_DEF_TIMEOUT\fP (which is minus two (-2)),
the default value of 100 milliseconds is applied.
.PP
The current value of the timeout can be interrogated using the
.BR dlpi_info (3)
library call.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B dlpi_set_timeout
function, include
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
and
.RB < dlpi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -ldlpi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B dlpi_set_timeout
function or include the
.B @libdir@/libdlpi.a
static library object as an target of the linking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B dlpi_set_timeout
is fully thread-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B dlpi_set_timeout
is successful, it returns \fB\)DLPI_SUCCESS\fP.
When
.B dlpi_set_timeout
fails, it returns a DLPI Library error or \fBLinux\fP system error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B dlpi_set_timeout
fails, it returns a DLPI Library error or \fBLinux\fP system error.
.B dlpi_set_timeout
may fail when:
.PP
The following DLPI errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDLPI_EINHANDLE\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ DLPI_EINHANDLE ]
The DLPI handle, \fIdh\fP, is not a valid data link handle.
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ DLPI_EINVAL ]
The \fIseconds\fP argument is invalid.
.PD
.PP
The following \fBLinux\fP system errors occur:
.TP \w'[\fBDLPI_EINHANDLE\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ EDEADLK ]
Setting the timeout value would result in single-party deadlock.
.\"

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B dlpi_set_timeout
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor symbol,
.BR _SUN_SOURCE ,
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >
header file, to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations
necessary for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < dlpi.h >
header file
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B dlpi_set_timeout
is compatible with the
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
.[
soldoc11
.]
and systems providing an interface equivalent to
.IR Solaris \(rg
DLPI Library,
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B DLPI Library
functions are
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
applications programs, drivers and modules to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
DLPI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the DLPI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
.PP

.BR dlpi (3),
.BR dlpi (7),
