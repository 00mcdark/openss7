.I fd
the file descriptor for the Stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B cdi_close
is a CDI API Library
.[
cdiapi
.]
subroutine.
It closes the CDI Stream associated with the specified file descriptor,
\fIfd\fP.
This function is to be preferred to the simple system call,
.BR close (2s).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B cdi_close
function, include
.RB < sys/cdi.h >
and
.RB < cdiapi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -lcdiapi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B cdi_close
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B cdi_close
is fully thread-safe.
What is described as global variables are in fact thread-specific data when
linked with
.BR libpthread .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B cdi_close
is successful, it returns zero (0) or a positive integer value.
When
.B cdi_close
fails, it returns a negative integer value (-1).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B cdi_close
fails, it returns a negative integer value (-1).
.B cdi_close
may fail when:
.PP
A CDI provider error occurs:
.TP \w'[\fB\)CD_PROTOSHORT\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ CD_SYSERR ]
a \fBLinux\fP system error occured and the \fBLinux\fP system error code is
contained in the
.IR errno (3)
global variable.
.PP
Also, the most recent CDI provider error is contained in the
.IR cerrno (3)
global variable.
.PP
A \fBLinux\fP system error occurs:
.TP \w'[\fB\)CD_PROTOSHORT\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ ELIBACC ]
the CDI API library was not intialized.  See
.BR cdi_init (3).
.RB [ EBADF ]
the file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
supplied does not correspond to a valid CDI Stream open for reading and
writing.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
one or more of the arguments are invalid.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
the call was interrupted by a signal before it could complete.
.TP
.RB [ ERESTART ]
the call was interrupted by a signal before it could begin.
.TP
.RB [ ERESTARTSYS ]
See [\fB\)ERESTART\fP].
.PP
Also, the most recent \fBLinux\fP system error is contained in the
.IR errno (3)
global variable.
.PP
In addition, any of the error number returned by
.BR close (2s)
can be returned by
.BR cdi_close .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B cdi_close
is a
.IR GCOM -specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor symbol,
.BR _GCOM_SOURCE ,
before including the
.RB < sys/cdi.h >
header file,
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < cdiapi.h >
header file
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B cdi_close
is compatible with the
.I GCOM
CDI API Library,
.[
npiapi
.]
and system providing an interface equivalent to the
.I GCOM
CDI API Library,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Previous version of the CDI API library did not have a
.B cdi_close
function an relied on
.BR close (2s).
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
also supports simple use of the
.BR close (2s)
system call; however,
.B cdi_close
is preferred.
.IP \(em
.B CDI API Library
functions are
.IR GCOM -specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR GCOM
software to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
CDI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the CDI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
