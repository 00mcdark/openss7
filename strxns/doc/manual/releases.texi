This is the OpenSS7 Release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, drivers and modules
used with the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} or
@cite{Linux STREAMS}@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use
it.} SVR 4.2 STREAMS releases.

The purpose of providing a separate release of this package was to separate the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, headers, drivers and modules from the @cite{Linux
STREAMS}@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use it.}
package for use with both @cite{Linux STREAMS}@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported
and deprecated.  Do not use it.} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} in preparation for replacement of the
former by the later.

The following sections provide information on @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} releases as well as
compatibility information of OpenSS7 release to the original GCOM releases of these modules and
drivers, as well as Linux kernel compatibility.

@itemize @bullet
@item A fairly LSB compliant GNU/Linux distribution.
@footnote{@xref{GNU/Linux Distributions}, for more information.}
@item Linux 2.4 or 2.6 kernel (2.4.10 - 2.4.27) or (2.6.3 - 2.6.17)
@item glibc2 or better.
@item GNU info (for info files).
@item GNU groff (for man pages).
@footnote{If you are using a Debian release, please make sure to install the groff extension package
(@samp{groff_ext}), as it contains the @command{refer} or @command{grefer} commands necessary for
including references in the manual pages.}
@item OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS
(@href{http://@-www.@-openss7.@-org/@-tarballs/@-streams-0.7a.6.@-tar.@-bz2, streams-0.7a.6} or better)
@footnote{Although this an other OpenSS7 STREAMS packages will build and install with Linux STREAMS
(LiS), @b{Linux STREAMS (LiS) is deprecated and cannot be supported because it is full of bugs!}}
@item OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility Modules
(@href{http://@-www.@-openss7.@-org/@-tarballs/@-strcompat-0.9.2.4.@-tar.@-bz2, strcompat-0.9.2.4} or better)

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is currently compatible with
@cite{Linux STREAMS},@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use it.}
however, to use the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package with @cite{LiS} requires use of the OpenSS7
release packages of @cite{LiS}.
The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is compatible with the OpenSS7 @b{LiS-2.18.3} release that
is available from the @url{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, The OpenSS7 Project Downloads
Page}.
But, do not use @cite{LiS}: it is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Use @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}
instead.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3
@subsection Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2), architectures (x86_64, SMP,
32-bit compatibility), recent Linux distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels
(2.6.15).

@itemize
@item Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support 32-bit ioctl
compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary compatibilty should not have been disrupted.  At
the same time as the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of the IO controls for the
ldl(4) driver has been added.
@item Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.
@item Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on x86_64 architecture.
Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler warnings.
@item Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on mailing list.
@item Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630 Hyper-Threaded SMP on
x86_64.  This package should now run well on N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.
@item Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibilty over 64-bit on x86_64.  Should apply well to
other 64-bit architectures as well.
@end itemize

This is a public beta test release of the package.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2
@subsection Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2

This is primarily a bug fixes release.  This release has been tested to build and install against
both @file{LiS-2.18.2} and @file{streams-0.7a.4} on both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels as well as the
@cite{Nex@-us@-Ware} cross-build environment.

This package is still largely untested and does not yet have a testsuite.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@subsection Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream version only to be consistent
with other @cite{OpenSS7} package releases.  All @cite{RPM} release numbers will be
@samp{-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)} and all @cite{Debian} release numbers will be @samp{_0}.  If you wish
to apply patches and relelease the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable
release suffix for your organization.  We leave @cite{Debian} release number @samp{_1} reserved for
your use, so you can still bundle the source in the @file{.dsc} file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels and popular distributions
based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider distribution support.  The package also supports both
@file{LiS-2.18.1} as well as @file{streams-0.7a} on both kernels.

@node Pre-Alpha Releases
@subsection Pre-Alpha Releases

@dfn{Pre-alpha} releases are releases that have received no testing whatsoever.  Code in the release
is not even known to configure or compile.  The purpose of a pre-alpha release is to make code and
documenation available for insepection only, and to solicit comments on the design approach or other
characteristics of the software package.

@dfn{Pre-alpha} release packages ship containing warnings recommending that the user not even
execute the contained code.

@node Alpha Releases
@subsection Alpha Releases

@dfn{Alpha} release are releases that have received little to no testing, or that have been tested
and contains known bugs or defects that make the package unsuitable even for testing.  The purpose
for an @dfn{alpha} release are the same as for the pre-alpha release, with the additional purpose
that it is an earily release of partially functional code that has problems that an external
developer might be willing to fix themselves and contribute back to the project.

@dfn{Alpha} release packages ship containing warnings that executing the code can crash machines and
might possibly do damage to systems upon which it is executed.

@node Beta Releases
@subsection Beta Releases

@dfn{Beta} releases are releases that have received some testing, but the testing to date is not
exhaustive.  @dfn{Beta} release packages do not ship with known defects.  All known defects are
respolved before distribution; however, as exhaustive testing has not been performed, unknown
defects may exist.  The purpose for a @dfn{beta} release is to provide a baseline for other
organizations to participate in the rigorous testing of the package.

@dfn{Beta} release packages ship containing warnings that the package has not been exhaustively
tested and that the package may cause systems to crash.  Suitability of software in this category
for production use is not advised by the project; however, as always, is at the discretion of the
user of the software.

@node Gamma Releases
@subsection Gamma Releases

@dfn{Gamma} release are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project, but
external testing has been minimal.  @dfn{Gamma} release packages do not ship with known defects.  As
exhaustive internal testing has been performed, unknown defects should be few.  Please remember that
there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Gamma} release packages typically resolve problems in previous @dfn{beta} releases, and might
not have had full regression testing performed.  Suitability of software in this category for
production use is at the discretion of the user of the software.   @dfn{The OpenSS7 Project}
recommends that the complete validation test suites provided with the package be performed and pass
on target systems before considering production use.

@node Production Releases
@subsection Production Releases

@dfn{Production} releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project and
validated on specific distributions and architectures.  @dfn{Production} release packages do not
ship with known defects.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Production} packages ship containig a list of validated distributions and architecutres.
Full regression testing of any maintenance changes is performed.  Suitability of software in this
category for production use on the specified target distributions and architectures is at the
discretion of the user.  It should not be necessary to preform validation tests on the set of
supported target systems before considering production use.
