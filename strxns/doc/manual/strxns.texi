@cindex licensing

This version of  @command{@value{PACKAGE_TARNAME}} is a version modified by
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/, The OpenSS7 Project} that contains drivers and modules previously
part of @cite{Linux STREAMS}@footnote{@xref{Top, Top, About This Manual, LiS, Linux STREAMS (LiS)
Installation and Reference Manual}.}.  In stark contrast to many other software packages released by
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/, The OpenSS7 Project}, this package contains code developed by other
parties.

This package is released and distributed under the @cite{AGPL} (@pxrefman{GNU Affero General Public
License}).  Please note, however, that there are different licensing terms for the manual pages and
some of the documentation (derived from OpenGroup@footnote{Formerly X/Open and UNIX International.}
publications and other sources).  Consult the permission notices contained in the documentation for
more information.

This manual is released under the @cite{FDL} (@pxrefman{GNU Free Documentation License}) with no
sections invariant.

@node Abstract
@unnumberedsec Abstract
@cindex manual abstract

This manual provides a @cite{@value{MANUAL_TYPE}} for @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.

@unnumberedsubsec Objective
@cindex manual objective

The objective of this manual is to provide a guide for the @dfn{STREAMS} programmer when
developing @dfn{STREAMS} modules, drivers and application programs for @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.

This guide provides information to developers on the use of the @dfn{STREAMS} mechanism at user and
kernel levels.

@dfn{STREAMS} was incorporated in UNIX System V Release 3 to augment the character input/output
(I/O) mechanism and to support development of communication services.

@dfn{STREAMS} provides developers with integral functions, a set of utility routines, and facilities
that expedite software design and implementation.

@unnumberedsubsec Intent
@cindex manual intent

The intent of this manual is to act as an introductory guide to the @dfn{STREAMS} programmer.  It
is intended to be read alone and is not intended to replace or supplement the
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} manual pages.  For a reference for writing code, the manual pages
(see @manref{STREAMS(9)}) provide a better reference to the programmer.
Although this describes the features of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package,
@uref{http://www.openss7.com/,OpenSS7 Corporation} is under no obligation to provide any software,
system or feature listed herein.

@unnumberedsubsec Audience
@cindex manual audience

This manual is intended for a highly technical audience.  The reader should already be familiar
with @cite{Linux} kernel programming, the @cite{Linux} file system, character devices, driver input
and output, interrupts, software interrupt handling, scheduling, process contexts, multiprocessor
locks, etc.

The guide is intended for network and systems programmers, who use the @dfn{STREAMS} mechanism at
user and kernel levels for @cite{Linux} and @cite{UNIX} system communication services.

Readers of the guide are expected to possess prior knowledge of the @cite{Linux} and @cite{UNIX}
system, programming, networking, and data communication.

@node Drivers
@section Drivers
@cindex drivers

The configuration of @dfn{STREAMS} drivers is performed when compiling the
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} subsystem.  The @dfn{XNS} subsystem, core drivers are part of every
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} system.

Kernel modules are installed by the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package in the
@file{/lib/modules/@value{_kversion}/@value{PACKAGE}/} directory, with either a @samp{.o} or
@samp{.ko} extension.@footnote{The kernel version, @samp{@value{_kversion}} is just an example.
When installed with a @samp{.ko} extension, dashes (@samp{-}) are also changed to underscores
(@samp{_}).}

The following lists the core drivers, @dfn{STREAMS} kernel tunable parameters, and @dfn{STREAMS}
configuration information:@footnote{Note that documentation of @dfn{XNS} drivers is in the form of
manual pages in Section 4 of the manual pages with the same name as the driver.}

@subsection Linux IP to DLPI Driver (ldl)

The LDL driver sits atop any existing Linux IP interface driver and presents a
DLPI interface to the STREAMS drivers above.  This allows any STREAMS driver
that communicates downstream using DLPI to utilize the services of existing
Linux drivers for Ethernet, Token Ring, etc.

@subsubheading Licensing

The LDL driver and the @command{ldltest} and @command{ldlconfig} programs were
originally written by Ole Husgaard and is licensed under the GNU General
Public License, @xrefman{GNU General Public License}.  This OpenSS7 release of the LDL driver also
includes Hewlett-Packard proposed patches.
An OpenSS7 AGPL header has been added to the source code files to make this
clear.

@subsection DLPI to Linux IP Driver (ip_to_dlpi)

@subsubheading Licensing

The ip_to_dlpi driver was originally written by @cite{The Software Group
Limited} and in licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License @xrefman{LGPL}.
Nevertheless, this OpenSS7 release of the @file{ip_to_dlpi} driver is released
under the GNU General Public License @xrefman{GNU General Public License}.
An OpenSS7 AGPL header has been added to the source code to make this clear.

@cindex modules

The configuration of @dfn{STREAMS} modules is performed when compiling the
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} subsystem.  The @dfn{XNS} subsystem, core modules are part of every
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} system.

Kernel modules are installed by the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package in the
@file{/lib/modules/@value{_kversion}/@value{PACKAGE}/} directory, with either a @samp{.o} or
@samp{.ko} extension.@footnote{The kernel version, @samp{@value{_kversion}} is just an example.
When installed with a @samp{.ko} extension, dashes (@samp{-}) are also changed to underscores
(@samp{_}).}

The following lists the core modules, @dfn{STREAMS} kernel tunable parameters, and @dfn{STREAMS}
configuration information:@footnote{Note that documentation of @dfn{XNS} modules is in the form of
manual pages in Section 4 of the manual pages with the same name as the modules.}

@subsection DLPI to Linux IP Module (ip_strm_mod)

@subsubheading Licensing

The @file{ip_strm_mod} module was originally written by Mikel L. Mathews and is licensed under the
GNU Lesser General Public License @xrefman{LGPL}.  However, this OpenSS7 release is distributed under
the GNU General Public License @xrefman{GNU General Public License}.  An OpenSS7 AGPL header has been added to the source code
to make this clear.

LiS includes two adaptor drivers to assist in interfacing STREAMS drivers to the Linux Kernel's
TCP/IP protocols.  One driver, @dfn{ip_strm_mod} acts as an IP interface driver.  It fits below IP
using standard @manref{ifconfig(8)} procedures.  It, in turn, communicates downstream with any STREAMS driver using
the DLPI protocol in a fashion similar to the manner in which IP on Unix systems interfaces to lower
interface drivers.  This allows a DLPI STREAMS driver to act as an interface driver to Linux TCP/IP.

@node Development
@section Development
@cindex developing

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_UCNAME}} package contains the necessary header files, shared and static
libraries, manuals and manual pages necessary for the development of kernel modules, @dfn{STREAMS}
modules and drivers, and applications programs based on the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_UCNAME}} package.

@menu
* Development Header Files::
* Static and Shared Libraries::
* Kernel Module Development::
* Manual Pages::
@end menu

@node Development Header Files
@subsection Header Files

Header files are installed, typically, in the @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}
subdirectory.@footnote{One of the major reasons for using this non-standard subdirectory is to avoid
conflict with header files already located in the @file{/usr/include} directory.} To use the header
files from the package, @samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} must be included in the @command{gcc}
command line as a compile option.  This is true regardless of whether user space or kernel space
programs are being compiled.

In general, @samp{-I} include directives on the @command{gcc} command line should be ordered in the
reverse order of the dependencies between packages.  So, for example, if the include files from all
add-on packages are required, the order of these directives would be: @samp{-I/usr/include/strss7
-I/usr/include/strsctp -I/usr/include/strinet -I/usr/include/strxnet -I/usr/include/strxns
-I/usr/include/strcompat -I/usr/include/streams}.

Following are the user visible header files provided by the
@command{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package in directory @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}:

@table @file

@item sys/npi.h
@pgindex sys/npi.h
@pgindex /usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}/sys/npi.h

This is a replacement for the standard @cite{UNIX International} header file.

@end table

@subsubsection User Space Programs

Typical include files for interacting with @dfn{STREAMS} from user space include the
@file{stropts.h} header file.  Additional header files for interacting with specific drivers or
modules may also be required.

@subsubsection Kernel Space Drivers and Modules

Typical include files for writing @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers for kernel space include the
@file{sys/cmn_err.h}, @file{sys/kmem.h}, @file{sys/dki.h}, @file{sys/stream.h}, @file{sys/ddi.h},
and @file{sys/strconf.h} header files.  Additional header files for interacting with specific
drivers or modules may also be required.

@node Static and Shared Libraries
@subsection Libraries

Shared or static versions of the @file{libstreams} library must be linked when using the
@command{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package.  This library must either be specified on the
@command{gcc} command line as a shared library (e.g. @samp{-lstreams}) or as a static library (e.g.
@samp{/usr/lib/libstreams.a}).

If the shared library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command line:

@table @asis

@end table

If the static library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command line:

@table @asis

@end table

@node Kernel Module Development
@subsection Kernel Modules

Developing @dfn{STREAMS} kernel modules is similar to user space programs with regard to header
files.  @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} should be placed as an include directory to search in
the @command{gcc} command line.  The rules for compiling @cite{Linux} kernel modules should be
followed.  In particular, several important intricacies should be considered:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The @command{gcc} compiler used to compile the kernel modules must be the same version of compiler
that was used to compile the kernel.

@item
The @command{gcc} command line must have the same compile flags that were used to compile the
kernel.

@item
The @command{gcc} command line must define several important kernel defines including
@samp{-DLINUX}, @samp{-D__KERNEL__}, as well as the base name of the module.

@item
The @command{gcc} command line must include several important include files directly on the command
line such as @samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-autoconf.h} and
maybe even @samp{--include
/@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-modversions.h}.@footnote{The kernel version
@samp{@value{_kversion}} is just an example.  For the running kernel, use the output of @samp{uname
-r}.}
