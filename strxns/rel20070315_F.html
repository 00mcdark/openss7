OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.5 of the STREAMS X/Open Networking Services (XNS) <em>strxns</em> package.

<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 XNS Networking package is an implementation of X/Open Network Services (XNS 5.2) for
Linux Fast-STREAMS and provides OSI conforming CDI, DLPI and NPI header files as well as several
DLPI and NPI modules and drivers that convert between Linux Native IP interface and the STREAMS DLPI
and NPI interface.  One allows DLPI drivers to be added to Linux as IP interfaces, another provides
DLPI access to native Linux IP interfaces, and a thrid provides NPI access to the Linux IP
subsystem.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
