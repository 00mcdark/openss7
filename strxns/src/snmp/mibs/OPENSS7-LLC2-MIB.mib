		 DOWN state, optionally check for a duplicate station

		 state of the LLC station component provides the 
		 enabling conditions for the operation of the service 
		 access point (SAP) components.
		 
		 The station component shall be capable of receiving and 
		 responding to XID and TEST command PDUs.  It shall 
		 optionally be capable of initiating the XID commend 
		 PDU, if duplicate address checking is performed by the 
		 LLC entity in a particular implementation; see table 2 
		 of IEEE 802.2 (ISO/IEC 8802-2).  These PDUs shall used 
		 the null DSAP address to denote that the station 
		 component is being referenced.
		 
		 The performance of the duplicate address check requires 
		 that the station component be prepared to received its 
		 own XID PDUs.  The definition of the MAC operation 
		 provides for the ability to simultaneously transmit and 
		 receive.  Since the DA = SA in the XID PDUs can be used 
		 for duplicate address check, the MAC will recognize its 
		 own address and pass the PDU to the station component.  
		 The station component will respond to an XID command 
		 PDU with an XID responose PDU, regardless of whether it 
		 originated from itself or a remote LLC.  The station 
		 component provides the duplicate address check by 
		 maintaining a count of received XID response PDUs.  If 
		 more than one XID response PDU is received, then at 
		 least one other identical MAC DA exists on the LAN.  
		 See figure 24 and table 1 in IEEE 802.2 (ISO/IEC 
		 8802-2) for details.
