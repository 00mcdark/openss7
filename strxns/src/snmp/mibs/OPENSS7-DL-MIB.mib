		 The localSapNames attribute of a communications entity 
		 managed object class indicate the local service access 
		 points providing user access to the communications 
		 entity.  In the case of a physical entity, the 
		 localSapNames identify the single physicalSAP, if any, 
		 associated with the physical entity.
		 
		 When there is no local service access point associated 
		 with the physical entity (the entity is locally 
		 isolated), this has the value zeroDotZero.  When there 
		 is a service access point associated with the entity, 
		 it is a RowPointer into the physicalSAP table of the 
		 service access point associated with the physical 
		 entity.

		 The localSapNames attribute identifies the providing 
		 entity's SAP objects.  (Note that the providing entity 
		 is identified by the providerEntityNames attribute.)  

		 In the case of the physicalEntity, the localSapNames 
		 are the physicalSAP MOs that represent the 
		 user-provider relationship for the physical 
		 communications entity.  For normal data circuits, there 
		 is at most one physicalSAP associated with the 
		 physicalEntity and visa versa.

		 In the case of the lAPBDLE, the localSapNames 
		 identifies the physicalSAP of the phsysicalEntity

		 In the case of the mACDLE, the providing entity is a

		 An objectCreation notification is generated whenever an

		 If creation occured in response to a management

		 possible to determine the source of the operation.  
		 None of the other optional parameters are used.
		 
		 An objectDeletion notification is generated whenever an

		 Implementations may optionally include the

		 The PhS provides for PhCs between PhS users.  Since 
		 connections cannot be established through the protocol 
		 at the Physical Layer but rather are configured when 
		 the service is created, the PhC, which is a logical 
		 concept, nevertheless must relate directly to the real 
		 physical media paths provided to the Physical Layer.  
		 For this reason: a) There is no distinction between 
		 connection-mode and connectionless-mode at the Physical 
		 Layer.  The service is independent of whether the 
		 higher layers operate in connection-mode or 
		 connectionless-mode.  b) Each PhC is identified within 
		 the Physical Layer.  c) A PhC can only relate to a 
		 particular PhSAP (i.e. a PhC implies a specific source 
		 PhSAP, and a specific destination PhSAP or group of 
		 PhSAPs if a multi-endpoint connection).

		 The PhC may traverse Physical Layer relay, or 
		 intermediate systems when several physical media are 
		 used in tandem.  Such relaying may be controlled 
		 through a mangement function exercised over a separate, 
		 but related, PhC, or may be controlled form the Network 
		 Layer, as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.200 | ISO/IEC 
		 7498-1, 7.5.4.2, for the interconnection of data 
		 circuits.  The Physical Layer does not make any routing 
		 decisions.  Intermediate systems may also be used for

		 DOWN state, optionally check for a duplicate station

		 state of the LLC station component provides the 
		 enabling conditions for the operation of the service 
		 access point (SAP) components.
		 
		 The station component shall be capable of receiving and 
		 responding to XID and TEST command PDUs.  It shall 
		 optionally be capable of initiating the XID commend 
		 PDU, if duplicate address checking is performed by the 
		 LLC entity in a particular implementation; see table 2 
		 of IEEE 802.2 (ISO/IEC 8802-2).  These PDUs shall used 
		 the null DSAP address to denote that the station 
		 component is being referenced.
		 
		 The performance of the duplicate address check requires 
		 that the station component be prepared to received its 
		 own XID PDUs.  The definition of the MAC operation 
		 provides for the ability to simultaneously transmit and 
		 receive.  Since the DA = SA in the XID PDUs can be used 
		 for duplicate address check, the MAC will recognize its 
		 own address and pass the PDU to the station component.  
		 The station component will respond to an XID command 
		 PDU with an XID responose PDU, regardless of whether it 
		 originated from itself or a remote LLC.  The station 
		 component provides the duplicate address check by 
		 maintaining a count of received XID response PDUs.  If 
		 more than one XID response PDU is received, then at 
		 least one other identical MAC DA exists on the LAN.
