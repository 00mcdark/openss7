strxns-0.9.2.3 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

STREAMS XNS is an implementation of X/Open Network Services (XNS 5.2)
for Linux Fast-STREAMS and provides OSI conforming CDI, DLPI and NPI
header files as well as several DLPI modules and drivers that convert
between the Linux Native IP interface and the STREAMS DLPI interface.
One allows DLPI drivers to be added to Linux as IP interfaces, the other
provides DLPI access to native Linux IP interfaces.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's third separate release from the OpenSS7
Project of the OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS modules, formerly part of the (now
deprecated) Linux STREAMS LiS-2.18.0 package.  These networking modules
provide DLPI and Linux IP interface drivers, as well as providing CDI,
DLPI and NPI header files.  The package contains all the necessary
manual pages and other documentation for XNS components in a separate
autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).  It
includes:

 - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support
   32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary
   compatibility should not have been disrupted.  At the same time as
   the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of the IO
   controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
    N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

 This is public beta release of the package: it deprecates previous
 releases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
 releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strxns package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strxns_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

for more information.  Also, see the strxns.pdf manual in the release

strxns-0.9.2.4 was released under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

The OpenSS7 XNS Networking package is an implementation of X/Open
Network Services (XNS 5.2) for Linux Fast-STREAMS and provides OSI
conforming CDI, DLPI and NPI header files as well as several DLPI and
NPI modules and drivers that convert between Linux Native IP interface
and the STREAMS DLPI and NPI interface.  One allows DLPI drivers to be
added to Linux as IP interfaces, another provides DLPI access to native
Linux IP interfaces, and a thrid provides NPI access to the Linux IP
subsystem.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's fourth separate release from the OpenSS7
Project of the OpenSS7 XNS Networking package, formerly part of the (now
deprecated) Linux STREAMS (LiS) package.  These networking modules
provide DLPI, NPI and Linux IP drivers, as well as providing CDI, DLPI
and NPI header files.  The package contains all the necessary manual
pages and other documentation for XNS components in a separate autoconf
tarball.

This release is both a maintenance release and a feature release.  The
major new feature added is a fully STREAMS based implementation of the
np_ip(4) driver.  This release is a stable production release for Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  strxns
     now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers, permitting
     2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number on 2.6
     kernels: LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new --with-optimize option
     to configure to accomplish this.

   - Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     doxy make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

 This is public production release of the package: it deprecates
 previous releases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with
 previous releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strxns package page at

for more information.  Also, see the strxns.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strxns_manual.html>).
