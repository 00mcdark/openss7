Subject: strxns 0.9.2.4 Released - STREAMS XNS 5.2 Networking for Linux

Package strxns-0.9.2.4 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 XNS Networking package is an implementation of X/Open
Network Services (XNS 5.2) for Linux Fast-STREAMS and provides OSI
conforming CDI, DLPI and NPI header files as well as several DLPI and
NPI modules and drivers that convert between Linux Native IP interface
and the STREAMS DLPI and NPI interface.  One allows DLPI drivers to be
added to Linux as IP interfaces, another provides DLPI access to native
Linux IP interfaces, and a thrid provides NPI access to the Linux IP
subsystem.

The package contains the following standard Open Systems Interconnect
(OSI) conforming header files:

     - <sys/cdi.h> Communications Device Interface
     - <sys/dlpi.h> Data Link Provider Interface Version 2.0.0
     - <sys/npi.h> Network Provider Interface Version 2.0.0

Note that the Transport Provider Interface (TPI) header files are
contained in the `strxnet' package.

The package currently includes the following STREAMS kernel modules and
drivers:

     - streams_link_driver.ko /dev/ldl
     - streams_ip_to_dlpi.ko /dev/ip2xinet
     - streams_ip_strms.ko module
     - streams_np_ip.ko /dev/np_ip /dev/ipcl /dev/ipco

ldl(4)
     The ldl(4) driver attempts to provide a Data Link Provider (DLPI)
     interface to an existing Ethernet driver under Linux.  This driver
     was originally written by Ole Husgaard and subsequently modified by
     Dave Grothe and later by Brian Bidulock of The OpenSS7 Project
     (http://www.openss7.org/).  It is distributed under the terms of
     the `GNU Public License (GPL) Version 2'.

ip2xnet(4)
     The ip2xnet(4) driver attempts the reverse: to take a STREAMS
     Ethernet driver that supports the Data Link Provider (DLPI)
     interface and link it underneath the ip2xnet(4) multiplexing driver
     to make it available for use by the Linux IP subsystem.  The driver
     was originally written by The Software Group Ltd. and subsequently
     modified by Brian Bidulock of The OpenSS7 Project
     (http://www.openss7.org/).  It was originally distributed under the
     terms of the LGPL, but is distributed by The OpenSS7 Project under
     the terms of the `GNU Public License (GPL) Version 2'.

ip_strms(4)
     The ip_strms(4) module is similar to the ip2xnet(4) driver,
     however, this is a module that is pushed over the DLPI Stream
     corresponding to the Data Link Provider (DLPI) driver instead of
     linking the DLPI Stream under a multiplexing driver as is done with
     the ip2xnet(4) driver.  Both have a similar effect.  The module was
     originally written by Mikel Matthews and Dave Grothe and
     subsequently modified by Brian Bidulock of The OpenSS7 Project
     (http://www.openss7.org/).  It was originally distributed under the
     terms of the LGPL, but is distributed by The OpenSS7 Project under
     the terms of the `GNU Public License (GPL) Version 2'.

np_ip(4)
     The np_ip(4) driver provides a Network Service Provider using the
     Network Provider Interface (NPI) Revision 2.0.0 service interface
     to the Linux IP subsystem.  The driver was originally written by
     Brian Bidulock for the OpenSS7 project for the purpose of testing
     Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and other direct IP
     based protocols.

The OpenSS7 XNS Networking package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of X/Open
Network Services (XNS) protocol stack components and applications for
the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's fourth separate release from the OpenSS7
Project of the OpenSS7 XNS Networking package, formerly part of the (now
deprecated) Linux STREAMS (LiS) package.  These networking modules
provide DLPI, NPI and Linux IP drivers, as well as providing CDI, DLPI
and NPI header files.  The package contains all the necessary manual
pages and other documentation for XNS components in a separate autoconf
tarball.

This release is both a maintenance release and a feature release.  The
major new feature added is a fully STREAMS based implementation of the
np_ip(4) driver.  This release is a stable production release for Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     `strxns' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strxns package page (http://www.openss7.org/strxns_pkg.html).

This release is primarily a maintenance release supporting recent
distributions and tool chains.  This release is a stable production
release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

 - Improvements to the common build environment with better support for
   standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

 - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

 - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kernels.

 - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as
   unpacked by separate tarball.

This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License

and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
