This is the OpenSS7 Project's fourth separate release from the OpenSS7 Project of the OpenSS7 XNS
Networking package, formerly part of the (now deprecated) Linux STREAMS (LiS) package.  These
networking modules provide DLPI, NPI and Linux IP drivers, as well as providing CDI, DLPI and NPI
header files.  The package contains all the necessary manual pages and other documentation for XNS
components in a separate autoconf tarball.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is both a maintenance release and a feature release.  The major new feature added is a
fully STREAMS based implementation of the <a href="man/man2html?4+np_ip">np_ip(4)</a> driver.  This
release is a stable production release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of
this release.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules and
drivers.  The <tt>make installcheck</tt> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <em>strxns</em> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent <tt>gcc</tt> compilers and
some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new <tt>--with-optimize</tt> option to <tt>configure</tt> to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added <tt>--disable-devel</tt> configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added <tt>send-pr</tt> script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>The package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the <tt>doxy</tt> make target.  See <tt>make help</tt> or README-make in the distribution for
more information.</li>

<em>This is a public production release of the package: it deprecates previous releases.  Please

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.4 of the STREAMS X/Open Networking Services (XNS) <em>strxns</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 XNS Networking package is an implementation of X/Open Network Services (XNS 5.2) for
Linux Fast-STREAMS and provides OSI conforming CDI, DLPI and NPI header files as well as several
DLPI and NPI modules and drivers that convert between Linux Native IP interface and the STREAMS DLPI
and NPI interface.  One allows DLPI drivers to be added to Linux as IP interfaces, another provides
DLPI access to native Linux IP interfaces, and a thrid provides NPI access to the Linux IP
subsystem.
<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds rpms for a
wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
