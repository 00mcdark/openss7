This is the first separate release from The OpenSS7 Project of the OpenSS7 STREAMS Channels package.
The package provides components that were previously part of the `strss7' package.  This package
contains all the necessary manual pages and other documentation.  The package is packaged as an
OpenSS7 style autoconf tarball.

This is the initial pre-alpha release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is an optional part of the OpenSS7
Master Package (as of openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is the initial public release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Additional features supported in all packages (see master package release notes).</li>
<!--
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new - -with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added - -disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.1 of the STREAMS Channels (CHAN) <em>strchan</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 STREAMS Channels package provides STREAMS modules and drivers, libraries, programs,
init scripts, and daemons that implement the OpenSS7 STREAMS isochronous channels for the
purpose of implementing data transmission links, or for carrying voice or other media, such as
channelization of T1 carrier facilities, or ATM AAL3.  This package also includes pseudo-isochronous
channels such as those provided by RTP.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Included are hardware device drivers and pseudo-device drivers that provide implementations of
specific channels.  A pseudo-device driver is planned to link into the Linux OSS (Open Sound
System) and ALS (Advanced Linux Sound).  Specific E1/T1 cards such as the V401P are supported by
this package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This package also supports data channel protocols for data communication over isochronous channels
such as HDLC and SS7 DAEDR/DAEDT/AERM/SUERM.  Upper layer link protocols, such as LAPB, LAPF, LAPM
and LLC are supported by separate packages.  These modules are provided here because they work
directly over an isochronous channel and are therefore designed to work with them.  These data links
provide support for the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISO/OSI as well as the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN Stacks and
OpenSS7 STREAMS SS7 Stack packages.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
