 Major changes for release strchan-0.9.2.1
------------------------------------------

This is the first separate release from `The OpenSS7 Project' of the
`OpenSS7 STREAMS Channels' package.  The package provides components
that were previously part of the `strss7' package.  This package
contains all the necessary manual pages and other documentation.  The
package is packaged as an OpenSS7 style autoconf tarball.

This is the initial pre-alpha release for `Linux Fast-STREAMS' and is
an optional part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (as of
`openss7-0.9.2.D').

This release is the initial public release.

_This is the initial public pre-alpha release of the package.  Please
see `README-alpha' in the release or `Maturity', in the manual._

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, contact <info@openss7.com>.
