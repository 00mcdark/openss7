Package strchan-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Channels package provides STREAMS modules and
drivers, libraries, programs, init scripts, and daemons that implement
the OpenSS7 STREAMS isochronous channels for the purpose of implementing
data transmission links, or for carrying voice or other media, such as
channelization of T1 carrier facilities, or ATM AAL3.  This package also
includes pseudo-isochronous channels such as those provided by RTP.

Included are hardware device drivers and pseudo-device drivers that
provide implementations of specific channels.  A pseudo-device driver is
planned to link into the Linux OSS (Open Sound System) and ALS (Advanced
Linux Sound).  Specific E1/T1 cards such as the V401P are supported by
this package.  Also included is an experimental driver that operates
also as a Zaptel driver for the purpose of OpenSS7/Asterisk integration
(but see also the NOTES file in the release).

This package also supports data channel protocols for data communication
over isochronous channels such as HDLC and SS7 DAEDR/DAEDT/AERM/SUERM.
Upper layer link protocols, such as LAPB, LAPF, LAPM and LLC are
supported by separate packages.  These modules are provided here because
they work directly over an isochronous channel and are therefore
designed to work with them.  These data links provide support for the
OpenSS7 STREAMS ISO/OSI as well as the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN Stacks and
OpenSS7 STREAMS SS7 Stack packages.

This package builds and installs the following STREAMS kernel modules
and drivers:

     - streams_ch.ko driver "/dev/ch" "/dev/ch_mg"
     - streams_mx.ko driver "/dev/mx" "/dev/mx_mg"
     - streams_mg.ko driver "/dev/mg" "/dev/mg_mg"
     - streams_pwe3.ko module "pwe3"
     - streams_zaptel.ko module "zaptel"
     - streams_cd_hdlc.ko module "cd_hdlc"
     - streams_cd_daed.ko module "cd_daed"

ch(4)
     The ch(4) multiplexing pseudo-device driver is a fully functional
     channel device capable of channelized, fractional or full-span
     E1/T1/J1 statistically multiplexed channels.  Streams opened on
     this device driver support delivery of the raw octet streams
     associated with the multiplexed channel.

mx(4)
     The mx(4) multiplexing pseudo-device driver is a fully functional
     matrix swithing device capable of switching, performing rate
     adaption, echo cancellation, digital padding, conferencing, tones,
     announcements, detection of tones, detection of speech, continuity
     tests, progress tones, A-law/mu-law conversion,
     decompression/compression, comb filtering, and other functions of a
     digital switching matrix.

mg(4)
     The mg(4) multiplexing pseudo-device driver is a fully functional
     media gateway device capable of providing conversion between
     Circuit Switched Network connections (via the mx(4) driver) and
     Ephemeral RTP streams (via the rtp(4) module and udp(4) driver).
     This device also supports Media Gateway Control Protocol
     communications of several forms over tcp(4) and sctp(4).

pwe3(4)
     The pwe3(4) module is a pushable STREAMS module that is pushed over
     a tcp(4) or sctp(4) Stream to provide pseudo-wire emulation
     end-to-end.  This device appears as though it is a channel device.

zaptel(4)
     The zaptel(4) multiplexing pseudo-device driver is a STREAMS driver
     that provides the historical zaptel(4) interface for asterisk and
     other open-PBX packages.  mx(4) streams are linked under the driver
     and represent spans that can be managed by zaptel(4).

cd_hdlc(4)
     The cd_hdlc(4) module is a pushable STREAMS module that provides
     the capabilties of the High-Level Data Link Control and can be
     pushed over a raw ch(4) channel to provide a Communications Device
     Interface (CDI) or Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) suitable for
     use with ISO/OSI protocols, X.25, ISDN or Frame Relay.

cd_daed(4)
     The cd_daed(4) module is a pushable STREAMS module that provides th
     capabilities of SS7 High-Level Data Link Control (Q.702) and can be
     pushed over a raw ch(4) channel to provide a Communications Device
     Interface (CDI) or Signalling Data Terminal Interface (SDTI)
     suitable for use with SS7 protocols.


The OpenSS7 STREAMS Channels package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS Channels applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, sponsor the OpenSS7 Project.  To sponsor the project,
contact <info@openss7.com>.

This is the first separate release from The OpenSS7 Project of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Channels package.  The package provides components that
were previously part of the `strss7' package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release openss-0.9.2.D, the Channel
components were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the Channel components previously part of the
`strss7' package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.(1) See TODO in the release, or `Schedule', in
the manual, for more information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is the
V401P channel driver.  In contrast to the X400P-SS7 driver from the
`strss7' package, this driver provides enhanced support for audio
channels and the basis for Zaptel integration.  The release also
contains a set of pushable modules for use with the channel driver that
provide HDLC/DAEDR capabilities for channels.  These components do not
as yet have validation test suites.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional components
necessary for Media Gateway switching support.

This is the initial pre-alpha release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is an
optional part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (as of openss7-0.9.2.D).
This release is also the initial public release.

_This is the initial public pre-alpha release of the package.  Please
see README-alpha in the release or `Maturity', in the manual._

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, contact <info@openss7.com>.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strchan package page (http://www.openss7.org/strchan_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strchan-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strchan-0.9.2.1/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `strchan.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/strchan_manual.html).

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, contact info@openss7.com.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

 - Improvements to the common build environment with better support for
   standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

 - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

 - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kernels.

 - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as
   unpacked by separate tarball.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
