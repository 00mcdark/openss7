.TH CH_DETACH_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Channel Interface (CHI)"
.SH NAME
.B CH_DETACH_REQ, CH_detach_req, CH_detach_req_t
\- channel detach request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CH_detach_req {
    ch_ulong ch_primitive;      /* always CH_DETACH_REQ */
} CH_detach_req_t;
\s+1\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Requests that the attached channel be detached from the requesting stream.
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I ch_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR CH_DETACH_REQ .
.SH ORIGINATOR
Channel Service User.
.SH STATES
This primitive is valid in state
.BR CHS_ATTACHED .
The resulting state is
.BR CHS_WACK_UREQ .
.SH RULES
These primitives require the channel service provider to generate one of the
following acknowledgments on receipt of the primitive, and the channel service
user must wait for the acknowledgment before issuing any other primitives:
.TP
.B Successful
Correct acknowledgement of the primitive is indicated with the
.BR CH_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.  In this case, the resulting state is
.BR CHS_DETACHED .
.TP
.B Non-fatal errors
These errors will be indicated with the
.BR CH_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.  In this case, the resulting state is unchanged and remains the
same as the state in which the primitive was issued.
.SH ERRORS
The allowable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.TP
.RB [ CHSYSERR ]
UNIX system error.
A UNIX system error occured during the execution of the primitive and the
.IR errno (3)
error number is provided in the
.I ch_unix_error
field of the
.BR CH_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADADDR ]
.\"Bad address format or content.
.TP
.RB [ CHOUTSTATE ]
Interface out of state.
The primitive would place the interface out of state.  The
.B CH_DETACH_REQ
primitive is only valid in state
.BR CHS_ATTACHED .
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADOPT ]
.\"Bad options format or content.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADPARM ]
.\"Bad parameter format or content.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADPARMTYPE ]
.\"Bad paramater structure type.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADFLAG ]
.\"Bad flag.
.TP
.RB [ CHBADPRIM ]
Bad primitive.
The primitive was unrecognized or poorly formatted.
.TP
.RB [ CHNOTSUPP ]
Primitive not supported.
The primitive is not supported by the channel service provider on the
requesting stream.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHNOADDR ]
.\"Address could not be assigned.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHADDRBUSY ]
.\"Address is busy.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CH_ATTACH_REQ (7),
.BR CH_OK_ACK (7),
.BR CH_ERROR_ACK (7).
