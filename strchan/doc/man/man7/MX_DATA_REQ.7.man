.SH NAME
.B MX_DATA_REQ, MX_data_req, MX_data_req_t
\- media data request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive is one optional
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks containing one or more bytes of media data.  The optional
.B M_PROTO
message block is structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MX_data_req {
    ulong mx_primitive;         /* always MX_DATA_REQ */
    ulong mx_slot;              /* slot within channel */
} MX_data_req_t;
\s+1\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Conveys the media data for transmission from the multiplex service user to the
multiplex service provider for the specified multiplex slot.
.PP
The optional
.B M_PROTO
message block permits the result of a
.BR write (2)
operation to be passed directly to the
.B MXI
conforming provider.
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I mx_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR MX_DATA_REQ .
.TP
.I mx_slot
specifies the multiplex slot to which the data bleongs.
Whenever the optional
.B M_PROTO
message block is not included,
.I mx_slot
is assumed to be zero (0).
.SH ORIGINATOR
Multiplex Service User.
.SH STATES
This primitive is valid in state
.BR MXS_CONNECTED
for the transmit direction.
The resulting state is
unchanged.
.SH RULES
The following rules apply to the data included in the associated
.B M_DATA
message blocks:
.IP \(em 4
The data included in the associated
.B M_DATA
message blocks must contain at least one byte of data.
.IP \(em 4
If there are no associated
.B M_DATA
message blocks,
or the associated blocks contain no data, the provider returns the fatal error
.RB [ EPROTO ].
.PP
This primitive requires no acknowledgment but may return a fatal error.
.SH ERRORS
Fatal errors are as follows:
.TP
.RB [ EPROTO ]
The amount of data specified in the associated
.B M_DATA
message blocks is invalid.  That is, the amount of data is zero (0) or is too
large for the multiplex service provider.  The multiplex service provider is
allowed to return this error if the data is longer than the multiplex block
size indicated in the
.BR MX_OPTMGMT_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR MX_DATA_IND (7).
.SH VERSIONS
This manpage was written for MXI Version 1.
