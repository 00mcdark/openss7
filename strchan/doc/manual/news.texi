@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This is the fourth separate release from @cite{The OpenSS7 Project} of the
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package.  The package provides components that were
previously part of the @file{strss7} package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release @file{openss-0.9.2.D}, the Channel
components were separated from the @file{strss7} package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the Channel components previously part of the @file{strss7}
package have been strapped into this release.  Components will be re-validated
against @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} on a module-by-module and driver-by-driver
basis.@footnote{Note that no component in this package can be supported by
@cite{LiS}: @cite{LiS} is simply too slow to allow these drivers to acheive any
degree of efficiency necessary for proper operation.} See @file{TODO} in the
release, or @refman{Schedule}, for more information about the release schedule.

This is the fourth pre-alpha release for @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and is an
optional part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (as of @file{openss7-0.9.2.D}).
This release is a maintenance release providing support for recent distributions
and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

@itemize -
@item
Added Open Media Gatway project document.

@item
Kernel module license made explicit "GPL v2".  And then changed back to "GPL".

@item
Added @file{mx-pmod} and @file{ch-pmod} STREAMS modules and manual pages (@manref{ch-pmod(4)} and
@manref{mx-pmod(4)}).  These STREAMS modules provide the CH and MX interfaces to a STREAMS-based
pipe acting as a channel or multiplex connection for testing and complex interconnection of channels
and multiplexes.

@item
64-bit corrections to the CHI header file, @file{sys/chi.h}.

@item
Updated documentation.

@item
License upgrade to GPL Version 3.

@item
Fix for freezestr() and unfreezestr() on 2.4 kernels.

@item
Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation primarily for
embedded targets.

@item
Improvements to common build process for embedded and cross-compile targets.

@item
Support for flex 2.5.33  in maintainer mode.

@end itemize

@emph{This is a public pre-alpha release of the package.  Please see
@file{README-alpha} in the release or @refman{Maturity}.}

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a reference point
for the community.  If you are interested in completion of this package, contact
@email{info@@openss7.com}.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and
builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the @cite{GNU General Public License
Version 3}.  The release is available as an @command{autoconf} tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html,downloads page} for the
@command{autoconf} tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and
binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/@value{PACKAGE}_pkg.html,@value{PACKAGE} package
page}.

@uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/ChangeLog}
and @uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/NEWS}

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1

This is the first separate release from @cite{The OpenSS7 Project} of the
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package.  The package provides components that
were previously part of the @file{strss7} package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release @file{openss-0.9.2.D}, the Channel
components were separated from the @file{strss7} package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the Channel components previously part of the
@file{strss7} package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.@footnote{Note that no component in this package can
be supported by @cite{LiS}: @cite{LiS} is simply too slow to allow these
drivers to acheive any degree of efficiency necessary for proper operation.}
See @file{TODO} in the release, or @refman{Schedule}, for more information
about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is the V401P
channel driver.  In contrast to the X400P-SS7 driver from the @cite{strss7}
package, this driver provides enhanced support for audio channels and the
basis for Zaptel integration.  The release also contains a set of pushable
modules for use with the channel driver that provide HDLC/DAEDR capabilities
for channels.  These components do not as yet have validation test suites.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional components
necessary for Media Gateway switching support.

This is the initial pre-alpha release for @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and is an
optional part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (as of @file{openss7-0.9.2.D}).
This release is also the initial public release.
