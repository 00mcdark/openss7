@c Revision 0.9.2.1  2006/10/13 07:57:35  brian
@c - added initial STREAMS Channel package
@c
@c =========================================================================

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package provides @dfn{STREAMS} modules and
drivers, libraries, programs, init scripts, and daemons that implement the
@cite{OpenSS7} @dfn{STEAMS} isochronous channels for the purpose of
implementing data transmission links, or for carrying voice or other media,
such as channelization of T1 carrier facilities, or ATM AAL3.  This package
also includes pseudo-isochronous channels such as those provided by RTP.

Included are hardware device drivers and pseudo-device drivers that provide
implementations of specific channels.  A pseudo-device driver is planned to
link into the @cite{Linux} OSS (Open Sound System) and ALS (Advanced Linux
Sound).  Specific E1/T1 cards such as the V401P are supported by this package.

@ignore
This package also supports data channel protocols for data communication over
isochronous channels such as HDLC and SS7 DAEDR/DAEDT/AERM/SUERM as well as
upper layer link protocols such as LAPB, LAPF, LAPD, LLC.  These modules are
provided here because they work directly over an isochronous channel and are
therefore designed to work with them.  These data links provide support for
the @cite{OpenSS7 STREAMS ISO/OSI} as well as the @cite{OpenSS7 STREAMS
SS7/ISDN/VoIP/SIGTRAN Stack} package.
@end ignore

This package builds and installs the following @dfn{STREAMS} kernel modules
and drivers:

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .95
@item @tab @minus{} @file{streams_ch.ko} driver @dfn{/dev/ch} @dfn{/dev/ch_mg}
@item @tab @minus{} @file{streams_mx.ko} driver @dfn{/dev/mx} @dfn{/dev/mx_mg}
@item @tab @minus{} @file{streams_mg.ko} driver @dfn{/dev/mg} @dfn{/dev/mg_mg}
@item @tab @minus{} @file{streams_pwe3.ko} module @dfn{pwe3}
@item @tab @minus{} @file{streams_rtp.ko} module @dfn{rtp}

@table @manref

@item ch(4)

@item mx(4)
The @manpage{mx(4)} multiplexing pseudo-device driver is a fully functional
matrix swithing device capable of switching, performing rate adaption, echo
cancellation, digital padding, conferencing, tones, announcements, detection
of tones, detection of speech, continuity tests, progress tones, A-law/mu-law
conversion, decompression/compression, comb filtering, and other functions of
a digital switching matrix.

@item mg(4)
The @manpage{mg(4)} multiplexing pseudo-device driver is a fully functional
media gateway device capable of providing conversion between Circuit Switched
Network connections (via the @manpage{mx(4)} driver) and Ephemeral RTP streams
(via the @manpage{rtp(4)} module and @manpage{udp(4)} driver).  This device
also supports Media Gateway Control Protocol communications of several forms
over @manpage{tcp(4)} and @manpage{sctp(4)}.

@item pwe3(4)
The @manpage{pwe3(4)} module is a pushable @dfn{STREAMS} module that is pushed
over a @manpage{tcp(4)} or @manpage{sctp(4)} Stream to provide pseudo-wire
emulation end-to-end.  This device appears as though it is a channel device.

@item rtp(4)
The @manpage{rtp(4)} module is a pushable @dfn{STREAMS} module that is pushed
over a @manpage{udp(4)} Stream to provide a full duplex, controlled (RTCP)
media stream connection.  The resulting Stream is suitable for linking under
the @manpage{mg(4)} multiplexing driver to provide Ephemeral RTP streams for
use with the Media Gateway Control Protocol.

@ignore
@item hdlc(4)
The @manpage{hdlc(4)} module a pushable @dfn{STREAMS} module that provides the
capabilties of the High-Level Data Link Control and can be pushed over a raw
@manpage{ch(4)} channel to provide a Communications Device Interface (CDI) or
Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) suitable for use with ISO/OSI protocols,
X.25 or ISDN.

@item q702(4)
The @manpage{q702(4)}

The package builds and installs the following shared object libraries:

@table @manref

@item librtp(3)
The @manpage{librtp(3)} library provides replacements for the @cite{AT&T}
@cite{rtplib} functions.  These functions are:

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .70
@item @manref{rtpopen(3)} @tab -- open an RTP channel
@end multitable

The library is incomplete.

@end table

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package includes kernel modules, @cite{SVR
4.2} @dfn{STREAMS} drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs,
daemons, and development environment for the development and execution of
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} applications for the @cite{SVR 4.2} @dfn{STREAMS}
environment.

This distribution is only currently applicable to @cite{Linux} 2.4 and 2.6
keernels and was targeted at @samp{ix86}, @samp{x86_64}, @samp{ppc} and
@samp{ppc64} architectures, but should build and install for other
architectures as well.

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a reference
point for the community.  If you are interested in completion of this package,
sponsor the OpenSS7 Project.  To sponsor the project, contact
@email{info@@openss7.com}.
