OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.2 of the STREAMS Channels (CHAN) <em>strchan</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 STREAMS Channels package provides STREAMS modules and drivers, libraries, programs,
init scripts, and daemons that implement the OpenSS7 STREAMS isochronous channels for the
purpose of implementing data transmission links, or for carrying voice or other media, such as
channelization of T1 carrier facilities, or ATM AAL3.  This package also includes pseudo-isochronous
channels such as those provided by RTP.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Included are hardware device drivers and pseudo-device drivers that provide implementations of
specific channels.  A pseudo-device driver is planned to link into the Linux OSS (Open Sound
System) and ALS (Advanced Linux Sound).  Specific E1/T1 cards such as the V401P are supported by
this package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This package also supports data channel protocols for data communication over isochronous channels
such as HDLC and SS7 DAEDR/DAEDT/AERM/SUERM.  Upper layer link protocols, such as LAPB, LAPF, LAPM
and LLC are supported by separate packages.  These modules are provided here because they work
directly over an isochronous channel and are therefore designed to work with them.  These data links
provide support for the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISO/OSI as well as the OpenSS7 STREAMS ISDN Stacks and
OpenSS7 STREAMS SS7 Stack packages.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
