strModInfoTable README
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This readme file describes the code generated by mib2c (using the MIBs
  for Dummies (MFD) configuration file). The code generated was
  generated specifically for the following SNMP table:

     strModInfoTable

  Your code will be called when the snmp agent receives requests for
  the strModInfoTable table.  The agent will start by looking for the right
  row in your existing data to operate on, if one exists.


  Configuration Variables
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Some variables used for code generation may be set to affect the code
  generation. You may override these variables by setting them in the
  file defaults/table-strModInfoTable.m2d, and then re-running mib2c.

    m2c_table_settable (currently '1')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not code is generated to support
    MIB object which have an access of read-write or read-create. The
    default is set based on whether or not the table contains writable
    objects, but can be over-ridden.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_settable = 0@


    m2c_table_dependencies (currently '1')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not code is generated to support
    checking dependencies between columns, rows or tables. The default
    is set based on whether or not the table contains writable objects,
    but can be over-ridden.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_dependencies = 0@


    m2c_table_row_creation (currently '0')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not code is generated to support
    checking creation of new rows via SNMP. The default is set based on
    whether or not the table contains read-create objects, but can be
    over-ridden.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_row_creation = 0@


    m2c_context_reg (currently 'netsnmp_data_list')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable contains the structure name to typedef for the
    strModInfoTable_registration.

    During initilization, you will provide a pointer to a structure of
    this type. This pointer is used as a parameter to many functions so
    that you have access to your registration data. The default is a
    netsnmp_data_list pointer, which will allow you to keep multiple
    pointers tagged by a text name. If you have a new or existing structure
    you would rather use, you can redefine this variable.
    

    To avoid regenerating code, you may also change this typedef directly
    in the strModInfoTable.h header.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_context_reg = "struct my_registration_context@


    m2c_data_context (currently 'generated')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable contains the structure name to typedef for the
    strModInfoTable_data.

    This typedef is used in the row request context structure for the table,
    strModInfoTable_rowreq_ctx.

    The typedef in the primary table context will be used for the data and
    undo structure types. This structure should contain all the data
    needed for all the columns in the table. The default is 'generated',
    which will cuase a new data strcuture to be generated with data members
    for each column.

    To avoid regenerating code, you may also change this typedef directly
    in the strModInfoTable.h header.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_data_context = "struct my_data_context"@


    m2c_data_allocate (currently '0')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not the data context (see above)
    requires memory to be allocated. The default generated data structure
    does not. If you are using a custom data context which needs to
    allocate memory, override this value and two additional functions
    will be generated:

      strModInfoTable_allocate_data
      strModInfoTable_release_data

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_data_allocate = 1@


    m2c_data_init (currently '1')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not the data context (see above)
    or any other items you have added to the table context requires
    initialization. The default generated data structure does not. If you
    are using a custom data context or have added items needing initialization
    to the table context, override this value and two additional functions
    will be generated:

      strModInfoTable_rowreq_ctx_init
      strModInfoTable_rowreq_ctx_cleanup

    Syntax: @eval 1 = 1@


    m2c_table_access (currently 'unsorted-external')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines which data interface will be use to generate
    code for looking up data for a given index. The default is the
    'container-cached' access code, which caches the data in a netsnmp-
    container (usually a sorted array).

    Available options can be determined by checking for mib2c configuration
    files that begin with 'mfd-access-*'.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_access = 'unsorted-external'@

 
    m2c_include_examples (currently '1')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not to generate example code. The
    default is to generate example code.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_include_examples = 0@


    m2c_data_transient (currently '2')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines how the generated example code deals with the
    data during data lookup. See the table readme file for details on how
    the current table access method interprets this value. In general,
    a value of 0 indicates persistent data, 1 indicates semi-transient and
    2 indicates transient data.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_data_transient = 0@


 Index(es) for the strModInfoTable table
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  The index(es) for the strModInfoTable table are:

     strModIdnum:
        Syntax:      UNSIGNED32
        DataType:    UNSIGNED32
        ASN type:    ASN_UNSIGNED
        C-code type: u_long
     strModInfoIndex:
        Syntax:      UNSIGNED32
        DataType:    UNSIGNED32
        ASN type:    ASN_UNSIGNED
        C-code type: u_long

  You should know how to set all these values from your data context,
  strModInfoTable_data.


************************************************************************
strModInfoTable File Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Several files have been generated to implement the strModInfoTable
  table. We'll go through these files, one by one, explaining each and
  letting you know which you need to edit.


File: strMIB_data_access.[c|h]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The strMIB_data_access file contains the interface to your data in
  its raw format.  These functions are used to build the row cache or 
  locate the row (depending on the table access method).

  Set MIB context
  -----------------
  TODO : Set MIB index values
  FUNC : strModInfoTable_indexes_set
  WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.c

  This is a convenience function for setting the index context from
  the native C data. Where necessary, value mapping should be done.

  This function should update the table index values (found in
  tbl_idx) for the given raw data.

  
  unsorted-external summary
  -------------------------
    The unsorted-external data access code is for cases when you data is
    kept UNSORTED and EXTERNAL to the agent/sub-agent.

    This code was generated based on the following assumptions or settings:

    1) The raw data for this table is UNSORTED.

       UNSORTED data is data that is not kept in the same order as the way
       SNMP expects the index(es) for the table to be kept. [It could very
       well be sorted in some other order, but for the purpose of SNMP, the
       order is incorrect.]  If you're not sure if your data is sorted
       in an SNMP compliant way, its likely not.

       Because the raw data is unsorted, to satisfy a particular request, the
       entire data set must be examined to find the apropriate index. This
       is done via a simple loop. The MFD handler will call your get_first
       function and the call the get_next function repeatedly, until it
       returns SNMPERR_NO_VARS.

    2) The raw data for this table is EXTERNAL.

       EXTERNAL data is data that is owned by some other process,
       device, file or mechanism.  The agent must use some interface to
       read or modify the data.  An external process may modify the data
       without the agent's knowledge. For example, the Net-SNMP agent
       implements the interface table (ifTable), which reports on
       network interfaces. The host operating system owns this data, and
       Net-SNMP must use system calls to report or manipulate the data.
       Examples of external data include data stored in kernel space, in
       files, in another non-memory shared process, and data stored in
       devices.

    3) The raw data for this table is TRANSIENT.

       TRANSIENT data is data that may be overwritten by another funtion
       or process. For example, many OS functions return data in a
       static buffer that will be reused the next time the function is
       called.  Because of this, we will assume that you will copy the
       raw data retrieved from these other sources to a generated
       structure for use within the Net-SNMP agent.  (Don't worry, we'll
       help you)


  The unsorted external data access code works by calling a few simple
  functions to get the index value for each row. Once the agent determines
  which row is needed to process an incoming request, another function
  is called to retrieve the data for that row.

  A simplified version of the pseudo-code looks like this:

     strModInfoTable_loop_init_context(loop)
     strModInfoTable_loop_get_first(loop,data)
     while( no_error ) {
        if( best_match(data, key)
           strModInfoTable_loop_save_position(loop,pos);
        strModInfoTable_loop_get_next(loop,data)
     }
     strModInfoTable_loop_get_data(pos,data)
     strModInfoTable_loop_cleanup_context(loop)

  We will talk about each individual step below.


  Defining context for the loop
  -----------------------------
    TODO : typedef strModInfoTable_loop_context
    WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.h

    Since the actual loop is in the MFD handler, a loop contex parameter
    is provided to help you keep track of where you are in between calls
    to functions that you wrote and the master MFD handler calls. The
    structure of this context is user defineable, and is defined in the
    file strModInfoTable_data_access.h.

    E.G., if your data is stored in a linked list, the obvious thing you
    want to know from one function call to the next is your current
    position in the linked list.  Thus the easiest context to use is a
    pointer within the linked list.  For an array, the current index to
    that array would be easiest.

    The funtion calls are actually passed a reference to the loop
    context, to allow the loop context to be allocated memory. Here are
    some simple examples definitions for various data formats. These
    definitions are used in examples later on.

      Linked list
      -----------
          typedef list_node strModInfoTable_loop_context;

      Array
      -----
          typedef integer strModInfoTable_loop_context;

      File
      ----
          typedef struct strModInfoTable_loop_context_s {
               char *      file_name;
               FILE *      f;
               char        line[128];
          } strModInfoTable_loop_context;


  Initialization
  --------------
    TODO : Initialization
    FUNC : strModInfoTable_loop_init_data
    WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.c

    The strModInfoTable_loop_init_data function will be called during startup to
    allow for any initialization needed for the data access routines.


  Preparing for the loop
  ----------------------
    TODO : initialize loop context
    FUNC : strModInfoTable_loop_init_context
    WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.c

    This function will be called before the start of a new itertion over
    the data. The loop context that is initialized here will be passed to
    strModInfoTable_loop_get_first and strModInfoTable_loop_get_next.
  
    Set the loop context variable ref->loop_ctx so that the iteration
    functions (get_first and get_next) can locate the apropriate data
    context.

    The primary purpose of the loop_init_context call  is to initialize
    the loop context data (ref). Here are some simple examples, based on the
    earlier example loop contexts.

      Linked list
      -----------
          ref->loop_ctx = my_table_head_ptr;

      Array
      -----
          /* instead of actually allocating memory, just use the pointer */
          /* as an integer */
          (integer)(ref->loop_ctx) = 0;

      File
      ----
          ref->loop_ctx = SNMP_MALLOC_TYPEDEF(strModInfoTable_loop_context);
          /* error checking here */
          ref->loop_ctx->file_name = (char*) reg->mfd_user_ctx;
          ref->loop_ctx->f = fopen( ref->loop_ctx->file_name, "r+" );


  The Loop
  --------
    TODO : return raw data
    FUNC : strModInfoTable_loop_get_first
    WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.c

    This function is called to return set the index(es) for the first
    strModInfoTable_data in the data set.

    Note that during the loop, the only important thing is the indexes.
    If access to your data is cheap/fast (e.g. you have a pointer to a
    structure in memory), it would make sense to update the data here.
    If, however, the accessing the data invovles more work (e.g. parsing
    some other existing data, or peforming calculations to derive the data),
    then you should limit yourslef to setting the indexes. Extracting the
    can be put off until the desired row is found See the notes on
    strModInfoTable_loop_get_data().

    Note that this function does not correspond to a SNMP GET pdu, and
    you should return data items in whatever order they are already in.
    (In fact, if your data is already ordered in the same order as the
    SNMP indexes, you shouldn't be using the unsorted-access code).
  
    This function should update the table index (rowreq_ctx_ref->rowreq_ctx->tbl_idx)
    values for the raw data (rowreq_ctx_ref->rowreq_ctx->data).

      Linked list
      -----------
          rowreq_ctx_ref->rowreq_ctx->data = loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx;

      Array
      -----
          /* assuming registration has array of pointers */
          rowreq_ctx_ref->rowreq_ctx->data = reg->mfd_user_ctx[(integer)(ref->loop_ctx)];

      File
      ----
          fgets(loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx->line, sizeof(loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx->line),
                loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx->f);
          rowreq_ctx_ref->rowreq_ctx->data = loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx->line;


    TODO : return raw data
    FUNC : strModInfoTable_loop_get_next
    WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.c

    This function returns the next data item in the data set. The same
    caveat applies here as did above. The indexes are the important parts
    during loop processing.

    Note that this function does not correspond to a SNMP GET-NEXT pdu, and
    you should return data items in whatever order they are already in.
    (In fact, if your data is already ordered in the same order as the
    SNMP indexes, you shouldn't be using the unsorted-access code).

      Linked list
      -----------
          loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx = loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx->next;
          rowreq_ctx_ref->rowreq_ctx->data = loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx;

      Array
      -----
          ++((integer)(ref->loop_ctx));
          /* assuming registration has array of pointers */
          rowreq_ctx_ref->rowreq_ctx->data = reg->mfd_user_ctx[(integer)(ref->loop_ctx)];

      File
      ----
          fgets(loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx->line, sizeof(loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx->line),
                loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx->f);
          rowreq_ctx_ref->rowreq_ctx->data = loop_ctx_ref->loop_ctx->line;


  Updating the Index
  ------------------
    TODO : update index for the raw data
    FUNC : strModInfoTable_indexes_set
    WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.c

    This is a convenience function for setting the index context from
    the native C data. Where necessary, value mapping should be done.

    This function should update the table index values (found in
    tbl_idx) for the given raw data.


  Saving a position in the loop
  -----------------------------
    TODO : Saving a position in the loop
    FUNC : strModInfoTable_loop_save_position
    WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.c

    During loop iteration, the iterator keeps track of the row that
    is the current best match. This function is called when the
    current row is a better match than any previous row.
  
    You should save any information you need to be able to locate this row
    again from the current loop context to a new loop context.
  
    At the end of the loop, when the best match has been found, the saved
    loop context will be used to get the data for the row by calling
    strModInfoTable_loop_get_data().
  
    Since your data is transient, you need to make a copy of it before
    the iterator moves on to the next row.


  Returning Data For an Index
  ---------------------------
    TODO : copy transient raw data to generated structure
    FUNC : strModInfoTable_loop_get_data
    WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.c

    At the end of the loop, when the best match has been found, the saved
    loop context will be used to get the data for the row by calling
    strModInfoTable_loop_get_data().


  Cleaning up after the loop
  --------------------------
    TODO : release any allocated memory
    FUNC : strModInfoTable_loop_cleanup_context
    WHERE: strModInfoTable_data_access.c

    This function will be called once the loop iteration has completed
    to release any memory allocated for loop reference.
    The purpose of the loop_cleanup_context call is to release any memory
    allocated for the loop context data. Here are some simple examples, based
    on the earlier example loop contexts.

      Linked list
      -----------
          /* nothing to do */

      Array
      -----
          /* nothing to do */

      File
      ----
          free(ref->loop_ctx);




File: strMIB_enums.h
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This file contains macros for mapping enumeration values when the
  enumerated values defined by the MIB do not match the values used
  internally.

  Review this file to see if any values need to be updated.


File: strMIB_data_get.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : strModInfoQueues_get

  Since this column has enumerated BITS, you should update or replace the
  IS_SET_* macros to properly determine whether or not a particular bit
  should be set.

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : strModInfoMinpsz_get

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : strModInfoMaxpsz_get

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : strModInfoHiwat_get

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : strModInfoLowat_get

  Get data for column
  -------------------
  TODO : retrieve column data from raw data
  FUNC : strModInfoTraceLevel_get



File: strMIB_data_set.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This code was generated based on the following assumptions or settings:

  1) None of the values for this table have DEPENDENCIES on other objects.

  DEPENDENCIES on other objects complicates SET request processing. When
  one or more columns in a table depend on another object (in the same
  table, or in another table), a DEPENDENCY exists. For example, if you
  have a table that determine a color with three columns (red, green and
  blue) that define the percentage of each primary color, the total for
  the three columns must equal 100 percent. So, in addition to checking
  that each colums has a valid value between 0 and 100, the total of
  all three columns must equal 100.

  Set $m2c_table_dependencies = 0 in defaults/table-strModInfoTable.m2d
  and regenerate code if this assumption is incorrect.

  2) This table does not support ROW CREATION.

  Supporting ROW CREATION allows new rows to be created via SNMP requests.


  Check dependencies
  ------------------
  TODO : check that all dependencies have been satisfied
  FUNC : strModInfoTable_check_dependencies

  This function will be called after all the individual columns have been
  set to their new values. Check for any dependencies between rows or
  tables in this function.


  Undo setup
  ----------
  TODO : save data for undo
  FUNC : strModInfoTable_undo_setup

  This function will be called before the individual undo_setup functions are
  called. This is where you should save any undo information which is not
  directly related to a particular column. This function will only be called
  once per row. After this function is called, any column which is being
  set will have its individual node undo_setup function called.



  Check value for column
  ----------------------
  TODO : perform additional validations on values for a set request
  FUNC : strModInfoMinpsz_check_value

  The generated code will automatically validate incoming requests against
  all the requirements specified by the syntax of the MIB. However, it is
  often the case that additional requirements are specified in the
  description of a MIB object. Those type of validations should be checked
  in this function.


  Undo setup for column
  ---------------------
  TODO : save the value for column
  FUNC : strModInfoMinpsz_undo_setup

  After the table level undo setup function has been called, the individual
  node undo setup functions will be called for columns which are being set.

  description of a MIB object. Those type of validations should be checked
  in this function.


  Undo setup for column
  ---------------------
  TODO : save the value for column
  FUNC : strModInfoTraceLevel_undo_setup

  After the table level undo setup function has been called, the individual
  node undo setup functions will be called for columns which are being set.


  Set value for column
  --------------------
  TODO : set the value for column
  FUNC : strModInfoTraceLevel_set

  After all the validations have been passed, this function will be called to
  set the new value.


  Undo value for column
  ---------------------
  TODO : undo set for column
  FUNC : strModInfoTraceLevel_undo

  If an error occurs after a column has been set, this function will be called
  to undo the set and restore the previous state.



  Commit changes
  --------------
  TODO : commit changes
  FUNC : strModInfoTable_commit

  After all values have been set, the commit function will be called.

Function flow
----------------------------------------------------
To give you the general idea of how the functions flow works, this
example flow is from a complete table implementation.

NOTE: Depending on your configuration, some of the functions used in the
      examples below  may not have been generated for the
      strModInfoTable table.

      Conversely, the examples below may not include some functions that
      were generated for the strModInfoTable table.

To watch the flow of the strModInfoTable table, use the
following debug tokens:

        snmp_agent
        helper:table:req
        strModInfoTable
        verbose:strModInfoTable
        internal:strModInfoTable

e.g.
        snmpd -f -Le -DstrModInfoTable,verbose:strModInfoTable,internal:strModInfoTable
