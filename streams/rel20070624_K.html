This is the twelfth OpenSS7 Project release of Linux Fast-STREAMS.  LiS was fully deprecated as of
a previous release and Linux Fast-STREAMS is now the only STREAMS package contained in the OpenSS7
Master Package (since openss7-0.9.2.D).
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is a stable, production grade release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The release includes
maintenance support for recent distributions and tool chain, but also includes some performance and
feature upgrades and inspection bug fixes.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Major features since the last public release are as follows:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Significant performance improvements.  STREAMS-based pipes in the package now perform a
staggering 2 to 5 times (%200 to %500) faster than the old legacy 4.1BSD/SVR3 Linux pipes currently
in the kernel.  See the <a href="streams_perf.html">STREAMS Performance</a> page for more
information.<bdo/></li>
<li>The impact of these performance changes is that Linux Fast-STREAMS now runs faster and looser on
SMP systems: if your drivers have race conditions they will likely be exacerbated by this
version.<bdo/></li>
<li>Significant rework of the Stream head and both enabling and back-enabling utilities.  Handling
of enabling flags <tt>QWANTR</tt> and <tt>QWANTW</tt> were not being performed quite properly.
Also, service procedures for the read side stream head read queue was added to defer wake-ups when
possible.  The result is the very significant observed performance improvements (as though it was
not fast enough already).<bdo/></li>
<li>The <a href="man2html?strace(8)"><b>strace</b>(8)</a>, <a
href="man2html?strerr(8)"><b>strerr</b>(8)</a> utilities and <a
href="man2html?log(4)"><b>log</b>(4)</a> driver have had some corrections.  The STREAMS trace logger
is now an excellent way for trace logging of fielded production drivers.  A number of OpenSS7
drivers have already been converted to use this facility.<bdo/></li>
<li>Significant rework of STREAMS synchronization.  OSF/1 Mentat style synchronization levels,
Solaris style perimeters, and SVR 4.2 style load refusal are fully supported.  Some idiosyncrasies
of AIX, HP-UX, MacOT and VxWorks are also supported.<bdo/></li>
<li>Corrected a few bugs.  See BUGS in the release for more information.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support build on openSUSE 10.2.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support build on Fedora 7 and 2.6.21 kernel.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).<bdo/></li>
<li>Support build on Ubuntu 7.04.<bdo/></li>
<li>Updated to gettext 0.16.1.<bdo/></li>
<li>Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 and 2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 kernel.<bdo/></li>
<li>Supports build on Fedora Core 6.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support for recent distributions and tool chains.<bdo/></li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.3 of the Linux Fast-STREAMS <em>streams</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The <cite>OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS</cite> package is a High-Performance STREAMS framework for
Linux that is compatible with SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS and a host of other commercial UNIX(R) STREAMS
implementations, with complete debugging and production release capabilities.  It is as a
high-performance, production replacement for the buggy and now deprecated Linux STREAMS (LiS).

<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on
production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
