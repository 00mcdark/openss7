5.5.1 Defect Notices
--------------------

"Linux Fast-STREAMS" could contain unknown defects.  This is a "beta"
release.  Some defects could be harmful.  Validation testing has been
performed by the `OpenSS7 Project' on this software for only a
restricted set of systems.  The software might fail to configure or
compile on other systems.  The `OpenSS7 Project' recommends that you do
not use this software for purposes other than validation testing and
evaluation, and then only with care. Use at your own risk.  Remember
that there is NO WARRANTY.(1)

This software is beta software.  As such, it might crash your kernel.
Installation of the software might mangle your header files or Linux
distribution in such a way as to make it unusable.  Crashes could lock
your system and rebooting the system might not repair the problem.  You
can possibly loose all the data on your system.  Because this software
might crash your kernel, the resulting unstable system could possibly
destroy computer hardware or peripherals making them unusable.  You
might void the warranty on any system on which you run this software.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

5.5.2 Known Defects
-------------------

With the exception of packages not originaly created by the `OpenSS7
Project', the `OpenSS7 Project' software does not ship with known bugs
in any release stage except "pre-alpha".  "Linux Fast-STREAMS" had no
known bugs at the time of release.

5.5.3 Defect History
--------------------

This section contains historical bugs that were encountered during
development and their resolutions.  This list serves two purposes:

  1. It captures bugs encountered between releases during development
     that could possibly reoccur (and the Moon is made of blue cheese).
     It therefore provides a place for users to look if they encounter
     a problem.

  2. It provides a low overhead bug list between releases for
     developers to use as a `TODO' list.

`001. 2006-07-05T21:54:49+0000'
     Fedora Core 5 reports a rwlock bug during udp module unloading as
     follows:

          BUG: rwlock wrong CPU on CPU#0, rmmod/7515
          Call Trace:
            {rwlock_bug+100}
            {_raw_write_unlock+88}
            {:streams:unregister_strnod+211}
            {:streams:unregister_clone+64}
            {:streams:unregister_strdev+24}
            {:streams_udp:udpterminate+26}
            {sys_delete_module+406}
            {system_call+126}

     It appears that unregister_strnod() is scheduling while holding a
     write lock on cdevsw_lock.  This is probably in iput() called
     within cmin_del.

     _*fixed*_ in `streams-0.7a.6.rc2'

     There were a number of places where sleeping functions were called
     with spin-locks held, causing the CPU awaking from the sleep to
     sometimes be different from the CPU that took the lock.  This was
     buggy, so I reworked all of these cdev and fmod sections to handle
     spin locks properly.  FC5/SMP on HT no longer reports these bugs.
