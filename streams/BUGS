5.5.2 Known Defects
-------------------

With the exception of packages not originaly created by the `OpenSS7 Project',
the `OpenSS7 Project' software does not ship with known bugs in any release
stage except "pre-alpha".  "Linux Fast-STREAMS" had no known bugs at the time
of release.

Nevertheless, this file contains bugs encountered during development and
their resolutions.  The OpenSS7 Project does not release software with
known bugs, so this list serves two purposes:

1. It captures bugs encountered between releases during development that
   could possibly reoccur (and the Moon is made of blue cheese).  It
   therefore provides a place for users to look if they encounter a
   problem.

2. I provides a low overhead bug list between releases for developers to
   use as a TODO list.

     Fedora Core 5 reports a rwlock bug during udp module unloading as
     follows:

     BUG: rwlock wrong CPU on CPU#0, rmmod/7515
     Call Trace:
       {rwlock_bug+100}
       {_raw_write_unlock+88}
       {:streams:unregister_strnod+211}
       {:streams:unregister_clone+64}
       {:streams:unregister_strdev+24}
       {:streams_udp:udpterminate+26}
       {sys_delete_module+406}
       {system_call+126}

     It appears that unregister_strnod() is scheduling while holding a
     write lock on cdevsw_lock.  This is probably in iput() called
     within cmin_del.
