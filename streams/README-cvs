The following is an extract from the manual to assist CVS developers:

6.1.4 Downloading from CVS
--------------------------

If you are a subscriber or sponsor of The OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org/) with CVS archive access privileges then you can
download release or mid-release versions of the 'streams' package from the
project CVS archive.

The Linux Fast-STREAMS package is located in the 'streams' subdirectory of
'/var/cvs'.  For release tag information, see *Note Releases::.

To access the archive from the project CVS pserver, use the following commands
to check out a version from the archive:

     % export CVSROOT='-d:pserver:USERNAME@cvs.openss7.com:2401/var/cvs'
     % cvs login
     Password: *********
     % cvs co -r streams_0.7a streams
     % cvs logout

It is, of course, possible to check out by date or by other criteria.  For more
information, see *Note cvs(1): (*manpages*)cvs(1).

Preparing the CVS Working Directory
...................................

Although public releases of the 'streams' package do not require
reconfiguration, creating a configurable directory from the CVS archive
requires tools not normally distributed with the other releases.

The build host requires the following GNU tools:

   * 'autoconf 2.59'

   * 'automake 1.9.3'

   * 'libtool 1.5.10'

   * 'gettext 0.14.1'

   * 'texinfo 4.0'

It should be stressed that, in particular, the 'autoconf' and 'automake' must
be at version releases '2.59' and '1.9'.  _The versions normally distributed in
mainstream GNU/Linux distributions are, in fact, much older than these
versions._  GNU version of these packages configured and installed to default
directories will install in '/usr/local/' allowing them to coexist with
distribution installed versions.

In addition, the build host requires a complete tool chain for compiling for
the target host, including kernel tools such as 'genksyms' and others.

To generate a configuration script and the necessary scriptlets required by the
GNU autoconf system, execute the following commands on the working directory:

     % autoreconf -fisv streams

where, 'streams' is the name of the directory to where the working copy was
checked out under the previous step.  This command generates the 'configure'
script and other missing pieces that are normally distributed with the release
Tar Balls or RPMs.  The package can now be configured and built using the same
instructions as are used for the Tar Ball, see *Note Configuring the Tar
Ball::, and *Note Building from the Tar Ball::.

Make sure that 'autoreconf --version' returns '2.59'.  Otherwise, you may need
to perform something like the following:

     % PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     % autoreconf -fisv streams

When configuring the package in a working directory and while working an
change-compile-test cycle that involves configuration macros or documentation,
I find it of great advantage to invoke the GNU 'configure' options
'--enable-maintainer-mode' and '--enable-dependency-tracking'.  The first of
these two options will add maintainer-specific targets to any generated
'Makefile', and the later will invoke automatic dependency tracking within the
'Makefile' so rebuilds after changes to macro, source or documentation files
will be automatically rebuilt.
