@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  No significant defect
corrections or development has been applied.
This release is a stable production release of @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

@itemize
@item
Testing of, and a few bug corrections to, the strlog() feature.  Trace and
error logging working well.

@item
Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode
diet patchset).

@item
The package now builds a replacement libLiS and libpLiS library so that user
applications written to work with LiS-2.18.1 through LiS-@value{VERSION_LIS}
do no need to be recompiled.  Added versioning of all library symbols in all
three libraries.

@item
Minor bug fixes to STREAMS library.  isastream(3) and fattach(3) must not
contain an asynchronous thread cancellation point, but they could.  Added
asynchronous thread cancellation protection to these functions to remove any
thread cancellation points.

@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against
64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The @samp{make installcheck} target will
now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit compatibility versions,
one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Many documentation updates for all @uref{http://www.openss7.org/,, OpenSS7}
packages.  Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
timely text documentation present in the release directory.

@item
Dropped support for @cite{LiS}.

@item
Updated @command{init} scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

@item
Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device
number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.
Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6 kernels under
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} only.  @cite{@value{PACKAGE}} now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices
per major device number on 2.6 kernels: @cite{LiS} cannot support this change.

@item
Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
distributions: support for additional @cite{SuSE} distributions on @code{ix86}
as well as @code{x86_64}.  Added distribution support includes @cite{SLES 9},
@cite{SLES 9 SP2}, @cite{SLES 9 SP3}, @cite{SLES 10}, @cite{SuSE 10.1}.

@item
Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent @command{gcc}
compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily
SUSE).

@item
Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in
addition to kernel programs.  Added new @option{--with-optimize} option to
@command{configure} to accomplish this.

@item
Added @command{--disable-devel} @command{configure} option to suppress
building and installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
or pure runtime targets that do not need the development environment (static
libraries, manual pages, documentation).

@item
Added @command{send-pr} script for automatic problem report generation.

@item
The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the 'doxy'
make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the distribution for more
information.
@end itemize

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.7a.6.rc3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.7a.6.rc3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.7a.6.rc3

Third release candidate.

@itemize
@item
Minor bug fixes to STREAMS library.  isastream(3) and fattach(3) must not
contain an asynchronous thread cancellation point, but they could.  Added
asynchronous thread cancellation protection to these functions to remove any
thread cancellation points.

@item
The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the 'doxy' make
target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the distribution for more
information.

@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.  The @samp{make installcheck} target will now automatically
test both 64-bit native and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other,
on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Added versioning of all library symbols.

@item
Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
documentation present in the release directory.

@item
Many documentation updates for all @uref{http://www.openss7.org/,, OpenSS7}
packages.

@item
This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp drivers at the
@cite{2006 SCTP Interop} at the @cite{University of British Columbia}.  This
version was interoperability tested with all implementations present.

@item
This release candidate provides support for additional @cite{SuSE} distributions
on @code{ix86} as well as @code{x86_64}.  Added distribution support includes
@cite{SLES 9}, @cite{SLES 9 SP2}, @cite{SLES 9 SP3}, @cite{SLES 10}, @cite{SuSE
10.1}.

@item
Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions.

@item
Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition
to kernel programs.  Added new @option{--with-optimize} option to
@command{configure} to accomplish this.

@item
Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent @command{gcc}
compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily
SUSE):

@multitable @columnfractions .01 .99
@item @minus{} @tab Remove @option{-fno-reorder-blocks} and
@option{-fno-reorder-functions} options added by some recent 2.6
@file{Makefile}s for @samp{x86_64} architecture: it impedes performance
optimizations.
@item @minus{} @tab Remove @option{-ffunction-sections} option added by some
recent 2.6 @file{Makefile}s for @samp{x86_64} architecture: this is an
insane option and should never have been used.
@item @minus{} @tab Add @option{-ffreestanding} that some older 2.6
@file{Makefile}s (such as that with @cite{SLES 9 2.6.5} kernel) neglect to add
to the @command{gcc} command line.
@item @minus{} @tab @cite{SLES 10} expands the directory before
@file{autoconf.h} on the @command{gcc} command line for some reason.
@command{configure} script watches out for this now.
@end multitable

@item
Updated @command{init} scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

@item
Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device
number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.

@item
@cite{@value{PACKAGE}} now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number on 2.6
kernels: @cite{LiS} cannot support this change.

This is primarily a bug fixes release and corrections resulting from testing.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE_TARNAME}-0.7a.3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE_TARNAME}-0.7a.3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE_TARNAME}-0.7a.3

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream version
only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All @cite{RPM}
release numbers will be @samp{-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)} and all @cite{Debian}
release numbers will be @samp{_0}.  If you wish to apply patches and release
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable release
suffix for your organization.  We leave @cite{Debian} release number @samp{_1}
reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the @file{.dsc}
file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels and
popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider distribution
support.

This was an internal beta test release and was not released publicly.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE_TARNAME}-0.7a-3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE_TARNAME}-0.7a-3

Removed all XTI/TLI and Linux networking code, headers and documentation from
streams distribution and set epoch at 0.  Linux networking code has been
migrated to the strxnet, strinet and strsctp packages.  The purpose for doing
this was to allow the Linux networking to build against
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} as well as @cite{Linux STREAMS} and is a
preparation for phasing out LiS and phasing in LfS.

This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.
