@c This file is include from install.texi and contains the descriptions for
@c package-specific enable/disable and with/without options

In addition, the following @command{configure} options, specific to the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package are available:

@table @command

@item --enable-streams-bcm
@opindex streams-bcm
Enable @dfn{STREAMS} binary compatibility mode.
When enabled, exported functions (and callouts) will never pass three arguments in registers on
architectures supporting @code{regparm} (i.e. @var{__i386__}, @var{__x86_64__}, @var{__k8__})
regardless of how the kernel was compiled.  Additional @cite{LiS} binary compatibility is also
enabled (e.g. credentials).  However, when enabled, Linux Fast-STREAMS will fail conformance
and validation testing (due to errors in @cite{LiS}).
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option has not been tested in some time: it is better not to enable it.

@item --disable-streams-irq
@opindex streams-irq
Disable @dfn{STREAMS} irq suppression.
When enabled, hard interrupts are suppressed whenever locks are taken throughout the @dfn{STREAMS}
executive.  When profiling using masked interrupt driven profilers, this makes profiling
difficult.  When disabled, soft interrupts are suppressed only.  This allows interrupt driven
profilers to give more meaningful information.  Do not disable hard interrupt suppression unless you
know what your are doing.  Also, as the softirq threads are run whenever soft interrupt locks are
released, this has a negative impact on @dfn{STREAMS} performance.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.

@item --enable-streams-stats
@opindex streams-stats
Enable @dfn{STREAMS} statistics counting.
When disabled, it is the module or driver's responsibility to increment @dfn{STREAMS} statistics
upon entry to putp, srvp, qopen, qclose and qadmin procedures.  When enabled, @dfn{STREAMS} will
perform statistics counting of entry to the putp, srvp, qopen, qclose and qadmin procedures whenever
a @type{module_stat} structure is associated with the queue.  The @manref{scls(8)} utility can be
used to display the statistics of any module or driver.  Enabling this feature has a slight negative
impact on performance and is contrary to @cite{SVR 4.2} behaviour and was, therefore, originally
disabled by default.  However, because few modules and drivers using this feature, it has been
enabled by default on recent releases.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
It is safe to disable this default; however, STREAMS drivers and modules in the OpenSS7 packages
will not perform their own statistics counting.

@item --enable-streams-syncqs
@opindex streams-syncqs
When enabled, MP synchronization queues are enabled for SMP kernels.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
It is safe to disable this option; however, all STREAMS drivers and module must be MP safe (marked
with the D_MP flag) or they will not load.

@item --disable-streams-utils
@opindex streams-utils
We experimented with putting the @dfn{STREAMS} utilities into their own package, @file{strutil},
however, this is not complete yet.  As the @file{strutil} was only necessary because @cite{LiS} did
not support these utilities itself, and @cite{LiS} is deprecated, the @file{strutil} package is also
deprecated, and this feature should always be left enabled.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
Do not disable this option.

@item --disable-big-compile
@opindex big-compile
When enabled, the @dfn{STREAMS}, the Stream head, and the clone driver are all compiled together in one
big compilation unit.  This allows the compiler greater opportunity to optimize.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
Do not disable this option.
This option has not been tested in some time: it is better not to enable it.

@item --enable-module-sth
@opindex module-sth

The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module,
unless option @samp{big-compile} is specified.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled} if @samp{big-compile} is enabled.
This option has not been tested in some time: it is better to leave it at its default.

This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option has not been tested in some time: it is better not to enable it.

@item --enable-driver-nuls
@opindex driver-nuls
Enable @file{nuls} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option has not been tested in some time: it is better not to enable it.

This option has not been tested in some time: it is better not to enable it.

@item --enable-driver-sad
@opindex driver-sad
Enable @file{sad} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-sfx
@opindex driver-sfx
Enable @file{sfx} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.

@item --enable-streams-fifos
@opindex streams-fifos
Enable override of system fifos with @dfn{STREAMS}-based fifos.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option is not tested.  Do not enable this option yet.

@item --with-streams-kthreads=[OPTION]
@opindex streams-kthreads
When enabled (@option{OPTION} is @samp{normal} or @samp{rt}), the @dfn{STREAMS} scheduler runs as
a kernel thread.  When disabled (@option{OPTION} is @samp{no}), the @dfn{STREAMS} scheduler runs
as a software interrupt (bottom half).  Running the @dfn{STREAMS} scheduler at bottom half instead
of a kernel thread breaks the @file{strinet} and other drivers, that must be able to invoke kernel
functions that might sleep (but don't).
The option to set kernel threads to @samp{normal} or @samp{rt} priority was added during performance
testing.  A priority of @samp{normal} (nice -19) was found to provide significant performance
increase over @samp{rt} (real-time 99) due to significantly reduced context switching for a wide
range of STREAMS drivers and modules.
Therefore, this option defaults to @samp{normal}.
This option has not been tested in some time: do not set it to @samp{no}, and leave it set a
@samp{normal}.
