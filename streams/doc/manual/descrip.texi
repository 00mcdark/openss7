The @cite{OpenSS7 @value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is a High-Performance @dfn{STREAMS} framework for
@cite{Linux} that is compatible with @cite{SVR 4.2 MP} @dfn{STREAMS} and a host of other commercial
@cite{UNIX@registeredsymbol{}} @dfn{STREAMS} implementations, with complete debugging and production
release capabilities.  It is as a high-performance, production replacement for the buggy and now
deprecated and unmaintained @cite{Linux STREAMS (LiS)}.

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package includes kernel modules, @cite{SVR 4.2} @dfn{STREAMS}
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the
development and execution of @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers under @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.
It is completely documented with over four hundred (469) manual pages, three (3) major print
set manuals and one (1) performance paper.

The package configures, compiles, installs and builds @file{rpm}s or @file{deb}s for a wide range of
Linux @manpage{rpm(1)}- or @manpage{dpkg(1)}-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching, recompiling or tainting the kernel.  Its small run-time footprint makes
the release suitable for embedded targets.

@ignore
This package is released under the @cite{GNU Affero Public License Version 3}; however, commercial
licensing and support is available from @uref{http://www.openss7.com/, OpenSS7 Corporation}.

The release is available as an @manpage{autoconf(1)} tarball, SRPM or DSC, or as a set of binary
@file{rpm}s or @file{deb}s.  See the @uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, download page} for
the @manpage{autoconf(1)} tarballs, SRPMs or DSCs.  See the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/streams_pkg.html, @command{streams} package page} for tarballs, source
and binary packages.

See the @uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/ChangeLog,,
@file{ChangeLog}} and @uref{http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}/NEWS,,
@file{NEWS}} file in the release for more information.  Also see the @value{PACKAGE_UCNAME}
@file{pdf} manual in the release (also in @file{html} at
<@uref{http://www.openss7.org/@value{PACKAGE_UCNAME}_manual.html}>.

@ignore
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} provides primarily a set of two kernel modules that provide the
@dfn{STREAMS} executive framework:

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .33 .34
@item @manpage{specfs(5)} @tab @manpage{STREAMS(9)}
@end multitable

It also provides a set of standard @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers:

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .33 .34
@item @manpage{bufmod(4)} @tab @manpage{clone(4)} @tab @manpage{nsdev(4)}
@item @manpage{connld(4)} @tab @manpage{echo(4)} @tab @manpage{nuls(4)}

@item @manpage{sth(4)} @tab @manpage{mux(4)} @tab @manpage{spx(4)}
@item @manpage{testmod(4)}
@end multitable

It also provides standard @dfn{STREAMS} header files and both shared and static libraries for
development of @dfn{STREAMS} applications, or kernel level @dfn{STREAMS} drivers and modules:

This distribution is applicable to both 2.4 and 2.6 series @cite{Linux} kernels and has been
validated on @code{ix86}, @code{x86_64}, @code{ppc} and @code{ppc64} architectures, but it should
build, install and validate for other @cite{Linux}-supported architectures as well.
