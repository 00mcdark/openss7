@node What is STREAMS?
@section What is @cite{STREAMS}?
@cindex what is @cite{STREAMS}?
@cindex @cite{STREAMS}, what is it?

@cite{STREAMS} is a facility first presented by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1984,@footnote{@cite{A Stream
Input-Output System, AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal 63, No. 8 Part 2 (October, 1984), pp.
1897-1910.}} originally implemented on 4.1BSD and later part of @cite{Bell Laboratories Version
Eight UNIX}, incorporated into
@cite{UNIX System V Release 3.0}
@cpindex UNIX System V Release 3.0
and enhanced in
@cite{UNIX System V Release 4}
@cpindex UNIX System V Release 4
and
@cite{UNIX System V Release 4.2}.
@cpindex UNIX System V Release 4.2
@cite{STREAMS} was used in @cite{SVR4} for terminal input/ouput, pseudo-terminals, pipes, named
pipes (FIFOs), interprocess communication and networking.

@cite{STREAMS} is a facility that allows for a reconfigurable full duplex communications path
(stream) between a user process and a driver in the kernel.  Protocol modules can be pushed onto and
popped from the stream between the user process and driver.  The user process, neighbouring protocol
modules and the driver communicate with each other using a message passing scheme closely related to
MOM (Message Oriented Middleware).  This permits a loose coupling between protocol modules, drivers
and user processes, allowing a third-party and loadable kernel module approach to be taken towards
the provisioning of protocol modules on platforms supporting @cite{STREAMS}.

@node Does Linux have STREAMS?
@section Does Linux have STREAMS?
@cindex Does Linux have STREAMS?

No, not as part of the kernel.  That is rather peculiar, particularly since Linux normally follows
SVR4 first and 4BSD second.

A number of attempts were made to move the @cite{Linux STREAM (LiS)} project into the @b{Linux}
kernel, however, each attempt crashed and burned in a shower of flames from BSD advocates on LKML.
Arguments against appear to be based more on @dfn{Religious Denomination} rather than valid
technical argument.  This is discussed more in the next section (@pxref{Why STREAMS?}).

@subsection Intel Binary Compatibility Suite (iBCS)
@cindex Intel Binary Compatibility Suite (iBCS)

The @cite{Intel Binary Compatibility Suite} provides binary compatibiltiy on the @cite{Intel}
architecture for systems comforming to @cite{SVR 4.2}.  @cite{RedHat} has released an @cite{iBCS}
module for their distributions of @b{Linux} and the @b{Linux Kernel} for some time.

@subsubsection OpenGroup Specifications
@cindex OpenGroup Specifications

OpenGroup and POSIX specifications have never directly addressed @dfn{STREAMS} implementation within
the operating system.  I suppose that this is primarily because 4BSD based system have seldom
included @dfn{STREAMS}.  Perhaps it was due to some religios upheaval from BSD advocates that did
not want to see @dfn{STREAMS} become part of a standard.

Nevertheless, the @dfn{STREAMS} subsystem has been an optional part of the
@url{http://www.opengroup.org/, OpenGroup}
specifications for some time.
It is my opnion that the
@url{http://www.opengroup.org/, OpenGroup}
has missed a rich opportuninty for standardization of kernel level interfaces.

easier thing to accomplish with @dfn{STREAMS} support.  Even though the @cite{XNS 5.2} specification

@node STREAMS versus Sockets
@subsection STREAMS versus Sockets
@cindex STREAMS versus Sockets

The basic question that is always asked is: "Why use @cite{STREAMS} when you can just use
@b{Linux}'s NET4 BSD Sockets instead?"

The answer to this question is that @cite{STREAMS} provides capabilities for specialized protocols
and streamed input/output requirements (such as media) that are not ammeniable to the sockets
interface or queue mechanisms.

Two examples are SS7 (Signalling System Number 7) which is a specialized Telecommunications protocol
used be switching equipment in the Public Switched Telephone Network; and transfering and
manipulating voice channels associated with telephone call or other telecommunications services.
These are the reasons why the @url{http://www.openss7.org/, OpenSS7 Project}
@cpindex OpenSS7 Project
originally embarked on using @cite{STREAMS}.  You will find that a large number of @cite{SS7} stack
vendors also delivery @cite{UNIX} and even @cite{RTOS} products on @cite{STREAMS}.

Although the BSD Sockets framework was established to permit arbitrary protocols to be implemented
within the framework, it is seldom that BSD Sockets is actually used in this fashion.

@quotation
The @cite{4.2BSD} version of @cite{UNIX} introduced @dfn{sockets}
@cindex sockets
[Leffler, McKusick, Karels,
Quaterman 1988].  The operating system provided an infrastructure in which network protocols could
be implemented.  It provided memory management facilities, a set of system calls for accesing
network software, an object-oriented framework for the network protocols themselves, and a
formalized device driver interface.  The @dfn{sockets}
@cindex sockets
mechanism was primarily used to implement the
TCP/IP
@cindex TCP/IP
protocols for the
ARPA
@cindex ARPANET
Internet.
The device driver interface made it possible for the operating system to support a wide range of
network controllers.  @dfn{sockets}
@cindex sockets
are widely used for the implementation of TCP/IP
@cindex TCP/IP
on @cite{UNIX} systems and have been ported to many implementations of @cite{UNIX System V}.
Although it is possible to implement other protocols within the @dfn{sockets} mechanism, it was not
often done.

An alternative infrastructure for providing network protocols is @dfn{STREAMS}, originally designed
by Dennis Ritchie [Ritchie 1984a] and first released in @cite{UNIX System V Release 3.0}.
@dfn{STREAMS} provides an environment in which communications protocols can be developed.  It
consists of a set of system calls, kernel functions and data structures.  With this environment it
is easier to write modular and reusable code.  The code is also simpler becuase many of the support
functions the programmer needs are provided by the @dfn{STREAMS} infrastructure.
@end quotation

Have you ever seen the RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) implemented under a Socket?  Why not?

There are several reasons that BSD Sockets have not been used for other protocol development:

@itemize

@item  Although BSD Sockets provides a framework for protocol development, it does not provide
many utility functions for working with arbitrary protocols.  Most of the utilities are DARPA
ARPANET specific.

@item Protocol to protocol module interfaces are poorly standardized for the BSD Sockets system,
whereas, protocol to protocol module service interfaces are well defined under OSI for
@cite{STREAMS}.

@item The BSD Sockets interface can easily be applied over @cite{STREAMS} transport protocol
modules; however, the reverse is not true: the @cite{STREAMS} interface cannot easily be provided
over the BSD Sockets protocol modules.@footnote{A case in point is the iBCS.
@cindex iBCS
@cindex Intel Binary Compatibility Suite
You will see in the iBCS
@cindex iBCS
@cindex Intel Binary Compatibility Suite
that, although a basic XTI over Sockets implementation can be provided, none of the @cite{STREAMS}
facilities can be supported.  In constrast the @cite{STREAMS} INET driver that performs XTI over
Sockets with in the @cite{STREAMS} framework is easily implemented as a single device driver and
provides both @cite{iBCS}
@cindex iBCS
@cindex Intel Binary Compatibility Suite
and @cite{STREAMS} capabilities.}

@item Support in the BSD Sockets model for dynamically loaded protocol (kernel) modules and
administrative reconfiguration of protocols and interfaces for new protocols are poorly supported.

@item The BSD Sockets model has almost no support for banded or priority message queues within the
model and no systemic approach to flow control.

@item The @b{Linux} implementation of BSD Sockets discards much of the general purpose protocol
framework, presumably in the persuit of speed.

@node Benefits of STREAMS
@subsection Benefits of @cite{STREAMS}
@cindex benefits of @cite{STREAMS}
@cindex @cite{STREAMS}, benefits

@cite{STREAMS} provides a flexible, portable and reusable set of tools for development of @b{Linux}
system communications services.  @cite{STREAMS} allows an easy creation of modules that offer
standard data communications services and the ability to manipulate those modules on a Stream.  From
user level, modules can be dynamically selected and interconnected; kernel programming, assembly,
and link editing are not required to create the interconnection.

@cite{STREAMS} also greatly simplifies the user interface for languages that have complex input and
output requirements.

@menu
* Standardized Service Interfaces::
* Manipulating Modules::
@end menu

@node Standardized Service Interfaces
@subsubsection Standardized Service Interfaces
@cindex Standardized Service Interfaces

@cite{STREAMS} simplifies the creation of modules that present a service interface to any
neighbouring application program, module, or device driver.  A service interface is defined at the
boundary between two neighbours.  In @cite{STREAMS}, a @i{service interface} is a set of messages
and the rules that allow passage of these messages across the boundary.  A module that implements a
service interface will receive a message from a neighbour and respond with an appropriate action
(for example, send back a requires to retransmit) based on the specific message received and the
preceding sequence of messages.

In general, any two modules can be connected anywhere in a Stream.  However, rational sequences are
generally constructed by connecting modules with compatible protocol service interfaces.  For
example, a module that implements an X.25 protocol layer, as shown in Figure 2-13, presents a
protocol service interface at its input and output sides.  In this case, other modules should only
be connected to the input and output side if they have the compatible X.25 service interface.

@node Manipulating Modules
@subsubsection Manipulating Modules
@cindex Manipulating Modules

@cite{STREAMS} provides the ability to manipulate modules from user level, to interchange modules
with common service interfaces, and to change the service interface to a @cite{STREAMS} user
process.  These capabilities yield further benefits when implementing networking services and
protocols, including:

@itemize
@item User level programs can be independent of underlying protocols and physical communications
media.
@item Network architectures and higher level protocols can be independent of underlying protocols,
drivers, and physical communications media.
@item Higher level services can be created by selecting and connecting lower level services and
protocols.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Protocol Portability

Figure 2-13 shows how the same X.25 protocol module can be used with different drivers on different
machines by implementing compatible service interfaces.  The X.25 protocol module interfaces are
Connection Oriented Network Service (CONS) and Link Access Protocol - Balanced (LAPB).

@subsubheading Protocol Substitution

Alternate protocol modules (and device drivers) can be exchanged on the same machine if they are
implemented to an equivalent service interface.

@subsubheading Protocol Migration

Figure 2-14 illustrates how @cite{STREAMS} can move functions between kernel software and front end
firmware.  A common downstream service interface allows the transport protocol module to be
independent of the number or type of modules below.  The same transport module will connect without
modification to either an X.25 module or X.25 driver that has the same service interface.

By shifting functions between software and firmware, you can produce cost-effective, functionally
equivalent systems over a wide range of configurations.  They can rapidly incorporate technological
advances.  The same transport protocol module can be used on a lower capacity machine, where
economics may preclude the use of front-end hardware, and also on a larger scale system where a
front-end is economically justified.

@subsubheading Module Reusability

Figure 2-15 shows the same canonical module (for example, one that provide delete and kill
processing on character strings) reused in two different Streams.  This module would typically be
implemented as a filter, with no downstream service interface.  In both cases, a tty interface is
presented to the Stream's user process since the module is nearest the Stream head.

@node Criticism of STREAMS
@subsection Criticism of STREAMS
@cindex Criticism of STREAMS

Following are some excepts from Dennis M. Ritchie's original (1984) Bell Technical Journal paper on
the stream I/O system.  These excerpts are the limitations of the system as were perceived by Dennis
M. Ritchie at the time.  Strangely enough, although every limitation listed by Dennis was fixed even
as early as @cite{UNIX System V Release 3.0} and even in the @cite{UNIX Eighth Edition}, some BSD
advocates with use these limitations as a reason for not using @dfn{STREAMS} in BSD.  Also, note
that BSD'ers will also say that @dfn{STREAMS} was a @cite{UNIX Eighth Edition} (Bell Laboratories
Researach version of UNIX) thing; however, Dennis' paper clearly states that the base system for the
initial @cite{Stream Input-Output System} was @cite{4.1BSD}.  Also note that @cite{4.1BSD} already
had @dfn{sockets} and that it is take that some of Ritchie's work was taken from @dfn{sockets}.  It
took unitl @cite{4.2BSD} for @cite{BBN} to add the @dfn{DARPANET} protocol stack to sockets.

Perhaps it is not so suprising why BSD'er hark back to Ritchie's original problem list for
@dfn{STREAMS}: because it was at that point that BSD decided to not follow the @cite{STREAMS} work
too closely, except as regards IPC, and UNIX domain mechanisms.  It is likely that BSD would have
used @dfn{STREAMS}, however, it was included in @cite{UNIX System V Release 3.0} and this was the
first release that @cite{AT&T} was allowed to aggressively market under the terms of the
@dfn{Modified Judgement}.

@quotation
Although the new organization performs well, it has several peculiarities and limitations.  Some of
them seem inherent, some are fixable, and some are the subject of current work.

I/O control calls turn into messages that require answers before a result can be returned to the
user.  Sometimes the message ultimately goes to another user-level process that may reply tardily or
never.  The stream is write-locked until the reply returns, in order to eliminate the need to
determine which process gets which reply.  A timout breaks the lock, so there is an unjustified
error return if a reply is late, and a long lockup period if one is lost.  The problem can be
ameliorated by working harder on it, but it typifies the difficulties that turn up when direct calls
are replaced by message-passing schemes.
@end quotation

This problem was never really fixed I suppose because most @dfn{STREAMS} specifications say that
only one @command{ioctl} can be outstanding for a given stream.  Nevertheless, an @command{ioctl}
identifier was added to the @var{M_IOCTL}
@vindex M_IOCTL
message that uniquely identifies the @command{ioctl}.  Nevertheless, a timer is still used.  With
the @var{I_STR}
@vindex I_STR
@command{ioctl}, however, the caller has control over the duration of the timeout.
Stange, but this unfixed problem is the one that seldom gets raised as a reason for no using
@dfn{STREAMS}.

@quotation
Several oddities appear because time spent in server routines cannot be assiged to any particular
user or process.  It is impossible, for example, for devices to support privileged @command{ioctl}
calls, because the device has no idea who generated the message.  Accounting and scheduling becomes
less accurate; a short census of several systems showed that between 4 and 8 per cent of non-idle
CPU time was being spent in server routines.  Finally, the anonimity fo server processing most
certainly makes it more difficult to measure the performance of the new I/O system.
@end quotation

This problem with privileged @command{ioctl} calls was easily fixed by adding the credentials of the
caller to the @var{M_IOCTL}
@vindex M_IOCTL
message.
This limitation is also not mentioned by @dfn{STREAMS} critics.

@quotation
In its current form the stream I/O system is purely data-driven.  That is, data is preseted by a
user's @command{write} call, and passes through to the device; conversly, data appears unbidden from
a device an passes to the top level, where it is picked up by @command{read} calls.  Wherever
possible flow control throttles down fast generators of data, but nowhere except at the consumer end
of a stream is there knowledge fo precisely how much data is desired.  Consider a command to execute
possibly interactive program on another machine connected to a stream.  The simplest such comman
sets up the connection and invokes the remote program, and then copies characters from its own
standard input to the stream, and from the stream to its standard output.  The scheme is adequate in
practice, but breaks when the user types more than the remote program expects.  For example, if the
remote program reads no input at all, any typed-ahead characters are sent to the remote system and
lost.  This demonstrates a problem, but I know of no solution inside the stream I/O mechanism
itself; other ideas will have to be applied.
@end quotation

Backenabling of queues and the use of the @var{M_READ}
@vindex M_READ
message makes it possible for the consumer end of the stream to signal its desire for data
downstream.
Also, in the example that Ritchie gives here, the network protocol (TCP) is of no help either.
This limitation is also not mentioned by @dfn{STREAMS} critics.

@quotation
Streams are linear connections; by themselves, they support no notion of muliplexing, fan-in or
fan-out.  Except at the ends of a stream, each invocation ofa  module has a unique "next" and
"previous" module.  Two locally-important applications of streams testify to the importance of
multiplexing: Blit terminal connections, where the multiplexing is done well, though at some
performance costs, but a user program, and remote execution of commands over a network, where it is
desired, but not now easy, to separate the standard output from error output.  It seems likely that
a general mulitplexing mechanism could help in both cases, but again, I do not yet know how to
design it.
@end quotation

This was, of course, solved, even in @cite{UNIX System V Release 3.0} with the
@var{I_LINK},
@vindex I_LINK
@var{I_PLINK},
@vindex I_PLINK
@var{I_UNLINK}
@vindex I_UNLINK
and
@var{I_PUNLINK}
@vindex I_PUNLINK
@dfn{STREAMS} @command{ioctl} commands and the concept of a multiplexing pseudo-device driver.
This fixed limitation you will see mentioned below.

The following excerpt shows how BSD'ers like to misinterpret the situation:

@quotation
Original work on the flexible configuration of IPC processing modules was done at Bell Laboratories
in UNIX Eigth Edition [Presotto & Richie, 1985].  This @i{stream I/O system} was based on UNIX
character I/O system.  It allowed a user process to open a raw terminal port and then to insert
appropriate kernel-processing modules, such as one to do normal terminal line editting.  Modules to
process network protocols also could be inserted.  Stacking a terminal-processing module on top of a
network-processing module allowed flexible and efficient implementation of @i{network virtual
terminals} within the kernel.  A problem with streams modules, however, is that they are inherently
linear in nature, and thus they do not adequately handle the fan-in and fan-out associated with
multiplexing in datagram-based networks; such multiplexing is done in device drivers, below the
modules proper.  The Eighth Edition stream I/O system was adopted in System V, Release 3 as the
STREAMS system.
@footnote{@cite{The Design and Implementation of the 4.4BSD Operating System, McKusick, et. al.,
(Addison-Wesley, 1996) pp. 15-16}}
@end quotation

Well, the @cite{UNIX Eighth Edition} @dfn{Stream Input-Output System} may have been included in
@cite{UNIX System V Release 3.0} as stated, however, Ritchie's @dfn{Stream Input-Output System} was
implemented on @cite{4.1BSD} for the October 1984 paper.

@quotation
The design of the networking facilities for 4.2BSD took a different approach, based on the
@dfn{socket} interface and a felxible multilayer network architecture.  This design allows a single
system to support multiple sets of networking protocols with stream datagram, and other types of
access.  Protocol modules may deal with multiplexing of data from different connection onto a single
transport medium, as well as with demultiplexing of data for different protocols and connection
received from each network device.  The 4.4BSD release made small extensions to the socket interface
to allow the implementation of the ISO networking protocols.

@cpindex SVR 4
Without @cite{STREAMS}, @b{Linux} is just another @cite{BSD},
@cpindex BSD
and perhaps a bad one.

@node Why Compatibility?
@section Why Compatibility?
@cindex Why Compatibility?

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} is designed and implemented to be compatible with as many
@cite{SVR 4.2 MP}
@cpindex SVR 4.2 MP
based implementations of @cite{STREAMS} as possible.  This is done for several reasons:

@enumerate

@item @i{Porting legacy drivers to @b{Linux}:}

Many legacy @cite{STREAMS} drivers have been written and developed for @cite{SVR 4.2 MP}
@cpindex SVR 4.2 MP
or @cite{UNIX} systems based on @cite{SVR 4.2 MP}.
@cpindex SVR 4.2 MP
Remaining compatible with as many implementation as possible permits these legacy drivers to be
easily ported from their native @cite{UNIX} variant to the @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}
@cpindex @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} (LfS)
environment, thus quickly porting these legacy drivers to @b{Linux}.

@item @i{Leverage of knowledge base:}

Many developers are familiar one or another of the mainstream @cite{UNIX} implemetations of
@cite{SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS}.
@cpindex SVR 4.2 MP, @cite{STREAMS}
By remaining as compatibile as possible with all these implementations of @cite{STREAMS} permits
knowledge and expertise in the @cite{UNIX} variant of @cite{STREAMS} to be transferred and applied
to @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}
@cpindex @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} (LfS)
on @b{Linux}.

@item @i{Reverse portability:}

Because it is as compatible as possible with other @cite{STREAMS} implemetnations, @cite{STREAMS}
drivers and modules developed on @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} can easily be ported to other
implementations if a set of compatibility and portability guidelines are followed.  This allows
@cite{STREAMS} drivers and modules developed on the @b{Linux} oeprating system to be used on branded
@cite{UNIX} systems with minimal porting and modification.

@item @i{Standardization:}

By being as compatible as possible with as many @cite{STREAMS} implementations as possible,
@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}
@cpindex @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} (LfS)
implements an @i{ipso facto} standard.  Unfortunately, the
@cite{OpenGroup}
@cpindex OpenGroup
and
@cite{POSIX}
@cpindex POSIX
have been very lacking in the standardization of internal kernel interfaces such as @cite{STREAMS}.
Maximum compatibility moves close to providing a standard for such interfaces.

@node Concepts
@section Concepts
@cindex concepts

There are three types of @cite{STREAMS} entities: the stream head, modules and drivers.
Stream heads are the kernel-space interface to the user process.  Modules are pushable streams
protocol modules that are optionally placed between the user process (stream head) and the driver
(stream end).  Drivers are device drivers or pseudo device drivers that can be opened using a
character device special file.
A simple stream is illustrated in @cite{Figure 2-1}.

@cartouche
@image{SPG_fig01,4in} @center @b{Figure 2-1.  Simple Stream}
@end cartouche

In the simple stream, the @dfn{downstream} flow is the flow from the User Process to the Driver that
passes through any optional intervening Modules; the @dfn{upstream} flow is the flow from the Driver
to the User Process, again through any intervening Modules.

It is possible to have a stream that does not contain a module or driver.  There are two types of
streams that do not contain a module or driver: a pipe and a fifo (named pipe).
A @dfn{STREAMS}-based pipe is illustrated in @cite{Figure 2-2}.
A @dfn{STREAMS}-based FIFO is illustrated in @cite{Figure 2-3}.

@cartouche
@image{SPG_fig02,4in} @center @b{Figure 2-2.  @cite{STREAMS}-based Pipe}
@end cartouche

Each @cite{STREAMS} driver or module has a number of constituent pieces.  Each @cite{STREAMS} driver
or module contains a stream table, stream adminstration, module information, module statistics and
queue initialization information.

Each instance of a @cite{STREAMS} driver or module has associated with it a stream head and a stream
end (the driver).  Each instance of a @cite{STREAMS} driver or module contains a queue pair with a
write (downstream) and read (upstream) queue.  Each queue possibly has queue band information
associated with the queue.

Each @cite{STREAMS} queue and queue band can contain @cite{STREAMS} messages.  @cite{STREAMS}
messages are composed of message blocks, data blocks and data buffers in a chain-buffer arrangement.

@node Driver Switch Table
@subsubsection Driver Switch Table
@cindex Driver Switch Table

Each @cite{STREAMS} device or pseudo-device driver registers itself with the @cite{STREAMS}
subsystem.  Nevertheless, to allow user processes to open the @cite{STREAMS} device requires that
the device by entered into the system device switch tables.  @cite{SVR 3} had a device switch table
and many other @cite{UNIX} implementations do as well.  @b{Linux} does not use a device switch
table.  Rather it uses character device lists hashed on device number, or a filesystem mechanism
such as the device filesystem (@samp{devfs}) or @samp{udev}.  @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} registers
devices with the necessary @b{Linux} mechanism and then implements an internal device switch table
as a list hashed on device number.

@node Module Switch Table
@subsubsection Module Switch Table
@cindex Module Switch Table

Each @cite{STREAMS} module registers itself with the @cite{STREAMS} subsystem and is assigned a
unique module identification number.  Even @cite{STREAMS} device or pseudo-device driver's are
assigned a unique module identification number.  In most @cite{STREAMS} implementations, modules are
entered by module identification number into a module switch table.  @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}
implements an internal module switch table as a list hashed on module identifier.

@node Stream Table
@subsubsection Stream Table
@cindex Stream Table

Each @cite{STREAMS} driver or module has an external entry point into a streams table.  The stream
table structure is the jumping off point for all driver or module specific datastrcutures that
describe the @cite{STREAMS} driver or module.  Each @cite{STREAMS} driver or module that is unique
within the @cite{STREAMS} subsystem has a unique stream table, regardless of which device major
numbers, module identifiers, or other external registrations have been performed on behalf of the
driver of module.

@node Stream Administration
@subsubsection Stream Administration
@cindex Stream Administration

Some @cite{STREAMS} implementation also provide some sort of @cite{STREAMS} administration structure
that contains more specific information about a @cite{STREAMS} driver or module, such as the name of
the driver or module, synchronization, administrative flags, version, etc.

@node Module Information
@subsubsection Module Information
@cindex Module Information

Each queue initialization strucutre points to a module information structure that provides some
queuing parameters for the stream.  Nevertheless, only one module information structure is necessary
for the stream.  The module information structure contains the module identifier, the module name,
the minimum and maximum packet sizes accepted on the queue from the stream head, and the high and
low water marks for flow control.  If any of this later information needs to differ on a queue basis
(upper or lower multiplex queues considered as well), then the module information structure must be
separate for each queue.

@node Module Statistics
@subsubsection Module Statistics
@cindex Module Statistics

Each queue initialization strucutre points to an optional module statistics structure that collects
statistics for the stream.

@node Stream Head
@subsubsection Stream Head
@cindex Stream Head

A stream head is a dynamic structure that is created whenever a @cite{STREAMS} driver (stream end)
is instantiated. 

@node Queue
@subsubsection Queue
@cindex Queue

A pair of queues are allocated, initialized, assigned and linked into a stream each time that a
@cite{STREAMS} driver or module is instantiated.  A pointer to the upstream (read) queue in the
queue pair is the common method for passing a handle to a driver or module instance.

@node Queue Band
@subsubsection Queue Band
@cindex Queue Band

Queue bands are allocated and initialized in association with queues on demand.  Many @cite{STREAMS}
drivers or modules never have queue bands allocated because they do not pass priority banded
messages, only normal messages.

@node Queue Initialization
@subsubsection Queue Initialization
@cindex Queue Initialization

Each stream table (driver or module) has associated with it queue intialization information for the
upstream and downstream queues.  If the driver is a multiplexing driver, it may also have associated
with the stream table upstream and downstream queue initialization information for the lower queue
pair.

The queue initialization structure provides function pointers to the put, service, open, close and
administrative procedures for the queue to which the initialization structure belongs.  Queue
initialization structures are bound to a specific upper or lower, upstream or downstream queue using
the stream table.  Up to four queue initialization structures can exist for a driver or module, or,
it is possible that all four queues could share a single queue initialization
structures.@footnote{Only the open and close procedures indicated in the queue initialization
structure associated with an upper upstream (read) queue will be used to open and close an instance
of the driver or module.  Open and close function pointers in the other queue initialization
structures will be ignored.}

@node Message Block
@subsubsection Message Block
@cindex Message Block

A message block is a structure that references a data block and data buffer.  Each message block is
a view into a data buffer and has a start (read pointer) and finish (write pointer) within the
buffer.  Message block can be chained together to form larger segmented messages.

@node Data Block
@subsubsection Data Block
@cindex Data Block

Data blocks are a description of a data buffer external to the buffer itself.  Each data block
describes the limits of the data buffer, its base, and size.  Each data block also hold a number of
flags and contains a data block type describing the type of data contained in the data buffer.
Data blocks also contain any necessary information concerning the functions and arguments necessary
to free the data buffer.  Also, data blocks maintain reference counts of the number of message
blocks that reference the data buffer.

@subsubheading Data Block Types
@cindex Data Block Types

@node Data Buffer
@subsubsection Data Buffer
@cindex Data Buffer

Data buffers can be allocated within the @cite{STREAMS} buffer pools using the @b{allocb}(9)
function or can be allocated externally and associated with a data and message block using the
@b{esballoc}(9) function.

The @b{Linux} 2.6 kernel is multi-threaded to make effective use of symmetric shared-memory
multiprocessor computers.  All parts of the kernel, including @cite{STREAMS} modules and drivers,
must ensure data integrity in a multiprocessing environment.  For the most part, developers must
ensure that concurrently running kernel threads do not attempt to manipulate the same data at the
same time.  The @cite{STREAMS} framework provides multi-threaded (MT) @cite{STREAMS} perimeters,
which allows the developer control over the level of concurrency allowed in a module.  The DDI/DKI
provides several advisory locks for protecting data.

@node Terminal I/O
@section Terminal I/O
@cindex terminal i/o

By default, terminal I/O in a @b{Linux} system does not use @cite{STREAMS}.  It, in fact, uses a
@cite{STREAMS} @samp{pty} emulation.  However, this is only an emulation and does not provide all
@cite{STREAMS} facilities.  It is not possible, for example, on a @b{Linux} @samp{pty} to push or
pop modules from a terminal.  The @b{Linux} @samp{pty} only provides emulation for read/write and
ioctl calls.

A separate auxiliary package for @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} that provides true @cite{STREAMS}-based
@cite{UNIX'98} compliant pseudo terminals is available.  This is the @code{strtty-0.7a.1} package
available from @url{http://www.openss7.org/, The OpenSS7 Project}.

@node Pipes
@section Pipes
@cindex pipes

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} supports @cite{STREMS}-based pipes as an optional feature.
@cite{STREAMS}-based pipes operate as described in the @cite{UNIX SVR4.2 Operating System API
Reference} and the @cite{UNIX System V Release 4 Programmer's Guide: STREAMS}.

By default, pipes created on @b{Linux} by the
@iftex
@b{pipe}(2)
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@inforef{pipe(2), , *manpages*}
@end ifnottex
system call are not @cite{STREAMS}-based.  To get @cite{STREAMS}-based pipes, configure @b{Linux
Fast-STREAMS} with configuration parameter @code{--enable-streams-fifos}.

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} also provides a character device based pipe facility using the
@iftex
@b{spx}(4)
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@inforef{spx(4), , *manpages*}
@end ifnottex
driver.

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} supports @cite{STREAMS}-based FIFOs (named pipes) as an optional feature.
@cite{STREAMS}-based FIFOs operate as described in the @cite{UNIX SVR4.2 Operating System API
Reference} and the @cite{UNIX System V Release 4 Programmer's Guide: STREAMS}.

By default, FIFOs created on @b{Linux} with the
@iftex
@b{mknod}(8)
@end iftex

@inforef{mknod(8), , *manpages*}

@subsection New System Calls

Just as experienced by the @b{Linux STREAMS} project, @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} suffers from the
inability to hook system calls that have been, otherwise, reserved in the @b{Linux} kernel for use
by @cite{STREAMS}.  Therefore, these system calls are implemented as library calls in the
@file{libsttreams} library instead of as system calls in the @file{libc} library.

@ftable @command

The functions in this section are provided as part of the core functions provided in the @b{Linux
Fast-STREASM} @cite{STREAMS} subsystem:

@ftable @command

@item putctl2(9)
Put a 2 byte control message on a @cite{STREAMS} message queue.

Many @cite{STREAMS} implementations provide this function.  When the errors that can be delivered to
the Stream Head in a @var{M_ERROR} message were broken from a single read/write error condition to a
separate read and write error condition, the
@b{putctl}(9)
@findex putctl(9)
function lost much of its utility.  Implementation of a
@b{putctl2}(9)
@findex putctl2(9)
function provides a similary capability for read/write error conditions as
@b{putctl}(9)
@findex putctl(9)
provided for combined error conditions previously.

@cite{AIX} implements this function.  @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} provides this function for
compatibility with @cite{AIX} and other @cite{SVR 4.2 MP} based @cite{STREAMS} implementations.

@b{putctl2}(9)
@findex putctl2(9)
is not very useful in an @i{MP} environment, where one really wants to place @var{M_ERROR} messages
on the @i{upstream} queue.  The function for that in the @i{MP} environment is
@b{putnextctl2}(9).
@findex putnextctl2(9)
@cite{AIX} does not implement the
@b{putnextctl2}(9)
@findex putnextctl2(9)
function, which is somewhat suprising, but then @cite{AIX} does not really handle @i{MP} enviroments
the same way that @cite{SVR 4.2 MP} does: the @cite{AIX Portable STREAMS Environment (PSE)} is
essentially single threaded, and @cite{AIX PSE} does not implement @var{QHLIST} meaning that the
synchronization for protecting dereferencing of @samp{q->q_next} pointers is not present.

@item splstr(9)
Set or restore priority levels.

Although @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} does not interpret priority levels in the same fashion as @cite{SVR
4.2 MP}, the
@b{splstr}(9)
@findex splstr(9)
is provided in support of @cite{AIX} and other @cite{STREAMS} implementations.

@cite{AIX} also does not interpret priority levels in the same manner, but provides

@b{splx}(9)
@findex splx(9)
functions in support of @cite{STREAMS}.

@item splx(9)

The following STREAMS specific system controls are provided by @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}:

@subsubheading sys.streams.cltime
@vrindex sys.streams.cltime
Defines the default time interval (in milliseconds) that closing stream will linger for messages to
clear its queues before finally closing.  Valid values are zero (0) or greater (MAXINT).  The
default value is the traditional UNIX value of 15,000 milliseconds (15 seconds).  This system
control defines the default for all new streams.  The value for a given stream can be changed with
the
@iftex
@b{streamio}(7)
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@inforef{streamio(7), , *manpages*}

after the stream is opened and before the stream is closed.

@subsubheading sys.streams.max_apush
@vrindex sys.streams.max_apush
Defines the maximum number of modules that can be configured for autopush onto a STREAMS driver.
Valid values are zero (0) or greater (MAXINT).  The default value is the traditional UNIX value of 8
modules.  This system control defines the maximum for all new autopush configurations.  Existing
autopush configurations are unchanged.

@end ifnottex
When true (non-zero), allocation priority will be honoured when allocating message blocks.  When
false (zero), allocation priority will be ignored.  Valid values are zero (0) or non-zero.  The
default value is zero (0).  Changing this value may have a positive or negative impact on system
performance.

@subsubheading sys.streams.nband
@vrindex sys.streams.nband
Defines the number of queue bands available.  Valid values are zero (0) or greater (@b{MAXINT}).

@subsubheading sys.streams.rtime
@vrindex sys.streams.rtime
Defines the time interval (in milliseconds) that the stream head will wait to forward held messages
when SNDHOLD is set for the stream head.  Valid values are zero (0) or greater (@b{MAXINT}).  The
default value is 10 milliseconds (one clock tick).  This is the system wide value for all streams.

number is the major or minor device number that is seen by user applications.

A number of administrative utilities are provided that assist with the assignment of device names
and number and are useful in boot scripts:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .85
@item @dfn{@b{autopush}(8)}
@findex autopush(8)
@tab -- verify modules and establish autopush lists
@item @dfn{@b{insf}(8)}

@tab -- load or unload @dfn{STREAMS} drviers and modules
@item @dfn{@b{strsetup}(8)}
@findex strsetup(8)
@tab -- create @dfn{STREAMS} devices
@end multitable

Another approach to establishment of dynamically allocated major device numbers is to use the @cite{LiS}
@cindex Linux STREAMS (LiS)
approach of creating minor device nodes using the @b{mknod}(9) and @b{unlink}(9) facilities provided
by the @cite{LiS}
@cindex Linux STREAMS (LiS)
compatibility module.  But this approach does not work well with demand loading of kernel modules
because it relies upon the @b{Linux} character device demand loading approach, or requires informing
@dfn{STREAMS} of all devices and drivers when @dfn{STREAMS} is being compiled.

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} supports the @b{Linux} character device module demand loading; however, the
@b{Linux} mechanism requires prior knowledge of the character major device number.  Some of the
administrative utilities above can load kernel modules and establish what major device number was
assigned.  See the individual manual pages for more information.

@node Internal Device Numbers
@section Internal Device Numbers
@cindex internal device numbers
@cindex device numbers, internal

Internal extended minor device number is a scheme whereby the @dfn{STREAMS} device driver does not
have to be concerned with architectural limitations on the number of minor device number available
to user applications (0 to 255 in @b{Linux 2.4}).  Instead, the driver treats the major device
number as a base internal device number against which a range of minor devices can be assigned
(currently 0 to 65535).  For external applications, device numbering consists of multiple (real)
external major device numbers that correspond to a single base internal major device number.
Internal extended device numbering is provided by the @b{getmajor}(9), @b{getminor}(9) and
@b{makedevice}(9) facilities.  Conversions between external (real) major device numbers and internal
(base) major device numbers can be performed with the @b{etoimajor}(9) and @b{itoemajor}(9)
utilities provided by the @dfn{UnixWare} compatibility modules.

Extended device numbering further complicates the matter of dynamic assignment of major device
numbers and makes it harder for boot and configuration scripts to properly create device nodes.

@node Clone Device
@section Clone Device
@cindex clone device

@subsection Traditional Cloning

The @b{clone}(4) driver supports traditional clone devices.  Traditional clone devices work by
assigning the clone major device number and a unique minor device number to a ``clone'' device.
When this device is opened, the minor device number of the device is used as the new major device
number and zero (0) is used as the minor device number, and the @b{qopen}(9) is chained to the
@b{qopen}(9) procedure of the new @b{streamtab}(9) structure resulting from looking up this newly
created device number.  @var{sflag} is always set to @samp{CLONEOPEN} when the traditional clone
driver opens a device.

@b{getemajor}(9), @b{geteminor}(9), @b{getmajor}(9) and @b{getminor}(9) still function as normal on
the resulting @var{devp} argument passed to the ultimate driver's @b{qopen}(9) procedure.  This is
true both for base and extended major device numbers.  The following table illustrates the situation
(assuming that the major device number assigned to the @b{clone}(4) device is 72):

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .25 .25 .25
@item @b{clone}		@tab @b{external}	@tab @b{internal}	@tab @var{sflag}
@item @t{72:32}		@tab @t{32:0}		@tab @t{32:000}		@tab @samp{CLONEOPEN}
@item @t{72:35}		@tab @t{35:0}		@tab @t{32:256}		@tab @samp{CLONEOPEN}
@item @t{72:37}		@tab @t{37:0}		@tab @t{32:512}		@tab @samp{CLONEOPEN}
@end multitable

If a driver wishes to assign an extended major device number in response to a @b{CLONEOPEN}, it
should use @b{makedevice}(9) with the major device number obtained with @b{getmajor}(9) and an
extended minor device number assigned by the driver.  In this way, extended minor device numbers are
transparent to the operation of the @b{clone}(4) driver and @samp{CLONEOPEN}.

@subsection New Cloning

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} supports the new cloning approach whereby a driver is permitted to alter
the device number returned in the @var{devp} argument to @b{qopen}(9) even though @var{sflag} is set
to @samp{DRVOPEN} instead of @samp{CLONEOPEN}.  The driver, at its discretion, can treat any minor
device number as a new style clone device, although normally minor device number zero (0) is usually
used as the clone minor.

The driver may either use an external (real) major device number or the internal (base) major device
number.  That is, when calling @b{makedevice}(9) to create the device to return to the @var{devp}
argument to @b{qopen}(9), the driver can use an external (real) major device number (returned by
@b{getemajor}(9)) combined with an assigned external (real) minor device number (from 0 to 255); or,
it can use an internal (base) major device number (returned by @b{getmajor}(9)) combined with an
assigned extended minor device number (from 0 to 65535).  The latter approach is often easier to
use.

@node Named STREAMS Device
@section Named STREAMS Device
@cindex named streams device

The @b{nsdev}(4) driver provides for a @dfn{Named STREAMS Device}.  This is a device numbering
approach unique to @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.  The @b{nsdev}(4) driver operates in a similar manner
to the @b{clone}(4) driver, however, the major number is derived from the prefix name of the device
and the minor number is taken directly from the minor number of the @b{nsdev}(4) device.

The following table summarizes the approach (assuming that the major device numbers assigned to the
@b{nsdev}(4) device are 74, 75, 76 and 77 and the major device numbers assigned to the @b{inet}(4)
driver are 32, 35 and 37):

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2 .2 .2 .2
@item @b{nsdev}		@tab		@tab @b{external}	@tab @b{internal}	@tab @var{sflag}
@item inet		@tab @t{74:000}	@tab @t{32:000}		@tab @t{32:000}		@tab @samp{DRVOPEN}
@item inet.udp		@tab @t{74:017}	@tab @t{32:017}		@tab @t{32:017}		@tab @samp{DRVOPEN}
@item inet.99		@tab @t{74:099}	@tab @t{32:099}		@tab @t{32:099}		@tab @samp{DRVOPEN}
@item inet.512		@tab @t{76:000}	@tab @t{37:000}		@tab @t{32:512}		@tab @samp{DRVOPEN}
@end multitable

The @b{nsdev}(4) device also has the characteristic that if a device name with a major device number
of the @b{nsdev}(4) device is opened and there is no device loaded that corresponds to the prefix
name of the device from which to obtain a major device number, the @b{nsdev}(4) will attempt to load
the `@t{@b{streams-}@i{prefix}}' kernel module using @b{request_module}(9) and try again: where,
@samp{prefix} is the prefix of the device name up to the first point character (corresponding to a
digit @kbd{.}).  So, in the example above, if the @samp{inet} driver was not loaded, but an attempt
was made to open the @file{/dev/inet.99} device, @dfn{STREAMS} would request the @file{streams-inet}
kernel module be loaded.  This approach simplifies kernel module loading as well as device numbering
and makes it easier for boot scripts to initialize devices.

@node spec Filesystem
@section spec Filesystem
@cindex spec filesystem

Another approach to creation and assignment of device numbers is the mountable @b{specfs}(5) file
system.  The @b{specfs}(5) file system can be mounted to provide an in-kernel device directory
similar to the @b{Linux} @file{devfs} file system and the @dfn{Solaris} devices file system.  The
@b{spefs}(5) file system should normally be mounted on the @file{/dev/streams} subdirectory by
system initialization scripts using a command such as: @command{mount -t specfs none /dev/streams}.
See @b{mount}(8) for more information.  Once mounted over the @file{/dev/streams} subdirectory,
subdirectories of @file{/dev/streams} corresponding to each loaded driver will appear.  So, for
example, when the @b{inet}(4) driver is loaded, the ``inet'' subdirectory will appear at
@file{/dev/streams/inet}.  Within each device subdirectory @file{/dev/streams/@i{devicename}/}, each
instance of the device will appear as a character device named with the instance number of the
device and having the eternal (real) major and external (real) minor device number.

The mounted @b{specfs}(5) file system also has the characteristic that if a device subdirectory
@file{/dev/streams/@i{devname}/} does not exist, but an attempt is made to read such a directory,
@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} will attempt to load kernel module @file{streams-@i{devname}} into the
kernel with @b{request_module}(9).  If the load is successful, the kernel module will register and
the subdirectory will be created and read.

Also, if an attempt is make to open a numbered file within a device subdirectory of
@file{/dev/streams/@i{devname}/@i{nnnn}} where, @samp{nnnn} is an octal, hexadecimal or decimal
ASCII number, @dfn{STREAMS} will open the driver (call @b{qopen}(9) for driver @samp{devname}) with
the instance number resulting from the conversion of the device name @samp{nnnn} to an instance
number.

These two characteristics permit symbolic links to be placed in the @file{/dev} directory that link
to a device name and instance number in the @file{/dev/stream} directory.  An example is given in
the table below:

@multitable @columnfractions .55 .15 .15 .15
@item @b{link} @tab @b{external} @tab @b{internal} @tab @var{sflag}
@item @file{/dev/tcp}@ ->@ @file{/dev/streams/inet/36} @tab @t{30:36} @tab @t{30:36} @tab @samp{DRVOPEN}
@item @file{/dev/udp}@ ->@ @file{/dev/streams/inet/39} @tab @t{30:39} @tab @t{30:39} @tab @samp{DRVOPEN}
@end multitable

In fact, it does not matter what the character device major or minor device number is on the node in
the @b{specfs}(5) file system.  This is because the inode in the file system is directly associated
with the @b{streamtab}(9) structure and instance number without using the normal @b{Linux} character
device mechanisms.  When a device instance exceeds the extended minor device numbering space
assigned to a device driver in the @b{specfs}(5) file system, device number displayed by
@b{stat}(2), @b{lstat}(2) or @b{fstat}(2) is chosen by wrapping the instance number into the
extended minor device numbering space.

This approach makes it unnecessary to statically assign major device numbers, or to dynamically
assign major device numbers to devices in boot scripts, and is by far the easiest approach.  All that
is required by packages at installation is that they establish the necessary symbolic links on
device name and instance number without concern for major device numbers.

@chapter Portability
@cindex portability

Although each of the manual pages of supported functions and structures provides compatiblity and
porting information, this document attempts to gather together pertinent information concerning
porting from various @cite{UNIX} operating system supporting @cite{STREAMS}.

The porting information is organized by the operating system from which porting is being attempted.
Note that, aside from configuration details, any system not listed here that is based on SVR 4.2 MP
or on a another of the implementations, should start with that implementation's portability
information.

Porting information is organized into sections as follows:

@menu

@subsubsection Priority Levels

@b{Linux} has a different concept of priority levels than @cite{SVR 4.2 MP}.  @b{Linux} has
basically 4 priority levels as follows:

@enumerate

@item Preemptive

At this priority level, software and hardware interrupts are enabled and the kernel is executing
with premption enabled.  This means that the currently executing kernel thread could preempt and
sleep in favor of another thread of kernel execution.

This priority level only exists on preemptive (mostly 2.6) kernels.

@item Non-Preemptive

At this priority level, software and hardware interrupts are enabled and the kernel is executing
with preemption disabled.  This means that the currently executing kernel thread will only be
interrupted by sofware or hardware interrupts.

This priority level exists in all kernels.

@item Software Interrupts Disabled

At this priority level, software interrupts are disabled and the kernel is executing with preemption
disabled.  This means that the currently executing kernel thread will only be interrupted by
hardware interrupts.

This is the case when the executing thread is processing a software interrupt, or when the currently
executing thread has disabled software interrupts.

This priority level exists in all kernels.

@item Interrupt Service Routines Disabled

At this priority level, hardware interrupts are disabled and the kernel is executing with preemption
disabled.  This means that the currently executing kernel thread will not be interrupted.

This is the case when the executing thread is processing a hardware interrupt, or when the currently
executing thread has disabled hardware interrupts.

This priority level exists in all kernels.

@end enumerate

@ftable @command

@item spl0(9)

The following compatibility functions are in addition to all SVR 4.2
compatibility functions.

@subsubsection Device Numbering

Device numbering has evolved since @cite{UNIX Sytem V Release 3.0} and provides internal, external
and extended device numbering.  These functions are provided for backwards compatibility with some
drivers that were written for the older system.  These are core functions in the @b{Linux
Fast-STREAMS} implementation.

@ftable @command

@item emajor(9)
Get the external (real) major device number from the device number.

@item eminor(9)
Get the external extended minor device number from the device number.

@item etoimajor(9)

@item getemajor(9)
Get the external (real) major device number.

@item geteminor(9)
Get the external minor device number.

@item itoemajor(9)
Convert an internal major device number to an external major device number.

@end ftable

@subsubsection Memory Alignment

In attempting to unify several deparaging @cite{UNIX}-based systems (in particular @cite{XENIX} and
@cite{UnixWare}, it became necessary to sometimes address the alignment of data buffers.  Certainly
a better way to accomplish this would be to allocate data buffers using other allocators that
provide the required alignment and other buffer characteristics and then allocating a message and
data block with a call to @b{esballoc}(9).  Nevertheless, these functions were provided for making
message blocks, data blocks and data buffers meet specific physical requirements.

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} provides these functions for compatibility, however, most of the physical
requirements provided are ignored.

@ftable @command

@item allocb_physreq(9)
Allocate a @cite{STREAMS} message and data block.

@item msgphysreq(9)

@section Developing Portable STREAMS Modules
@cindex developing portable streams modules

In the process of creating the @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} subsystem in such a way so as to facilitate
portability of @cite{STREAMS} drivers and modules from a wide range of @cite{UNIX} operating system
variants, a number of guidelines for the development of portable @cite{STREAMS} drivers and moduels
have been developed.  These guidelines, when adhered to, will allow the resulting driver or module
to be ported to another @cite{STREAMS} implementation with minimal effort.  These portability
guidelines are collected here.

@end iftex
@ifnottex
@inforef{streamio(2), , *manpages*}),
@end ifnottex
are often illustrated as small integer numbers, with some @cite{STREAMS} implementations, including
@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}, these identifiers are kernel addresses (pointers) and are never small
integer values like 1, 2, or 3.

Also, there is no guarantee that the identifier will be positive.  It is guaranteed that the retuned
identifier will not be zero (0).  Zero is used by these function as a return value to indicate an
error.

Portable @cite{STREAMS} drivers and modules will not depend upon the returned identifier from

@ifnottex
@inforef{streamio(2), , *manpages*}
@end ifnottex
as being any specific range of value.  Portable drivers and modules will save any returned
identifiers in data types that will not loose the precision of the identifier.

@subsubheading UNIX Device Numbering

@quotation
In versions of @cite{UNIX System V} previous to @cite{Release 4}, the major and minor device numbers
were each 8 bit, and they were packed into a 16 bit word (usually a C Language @var{short}
variable).  Under @cite{UNIX System V Release 4}, the device numbers are held in a @samp{dev_t}
@tpindex dev_t
variable, which is often implemented as a 32 bit integer.  The minor device number is held as 14
bits, and a further 8 bits are used for the major device number.  @samp{dev_t}
@tpindex dev_t
is ofter referred to as the "expanded device type", since it allows many more minor devices than
before.

Many drivers were written for earlier releases, an may eventually be ported to @cite{UNIX System V
Release 4}.  In earlier releases, some manufacturers got around the 256 minor device number limit by
using multiple major device numbers for a device.  Devices were created with different major device
numbers (the external major device number) but they all mapped to the same deivce driver entry in
the device switch tables (the internal device number).  Even under this scheme, each major device
could only support 256 minor devices, but the driver could support many more.  This has been
recognized in @cite{UNIX System V Release 4}, and functions are provided to do this mapping; for
example, the function @command{etoimajor}() and so on, give a machine independent interface to the
device number mapping.@footnote{@cite{The Magic Garden Explained}}
@end quotation

@subsubheading Linux Device Numbering

Verions of the @b{Linux} kernel in the 2.4 kernel series and prior to 2.6 also provided an 8 bit
major device number and an 8 bit minor device number grouped into a 16-bit combined device number.
Linux 2.6 kernels (and some patched 2.4 kernels) now have larger device numbers.  These extended
device numbers are 12 bits for major device number and 20 bits for minor device number, with 32 bits
for the combined device number.

@subsubheading LiS Device Numbering
@cindex Linux STREAMS (LiS)

@cite{LiS}
@cindex Linux STREAMS (LiS)
prior to the 2.18.0 release was incapable of providing an internal representation of the device
number and the number of minor device numbers for a device driver was restricted to
256.@footnote{Actually, 255 as the kernel reserved minor device number 255 for expansion.}  Many
@url{http://www.openss7.org/, OpenSS7} device drivers written for @cite{LiS}
@cindex Linux STREAMS (LiS)
would allocate additional major device numbers if required.  Good examples of devices that require
more than 255 minor device numbers are INET clone devices, SCTP streams, SS7 singalling link
streams, MG media channels, etc.  These streams are often @var{I_PLINK}ed
@vindex I_PLINK
under a multiplexing driver and do not even consume a system file descriptor.

@subsubheading @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} Device Numbering

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} began with extended device numbering.  The @file{specfs} shadow special
character device filesystem used by @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} uses the @samp{inode} number to hold the
@samp{dev_t}
@tpindex dev_t
device number instead of the @samp{inode->i_rdev}, which on older kernels is only a 16-bit
@var{short}.

In earlier versions of @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}, the internal device numbering is 16-bits for major
device number and 16-bits for minor device number.  This will soon be changed to 12-bits for major
device number and 20-bits for minor device number to accomodate the newer @b{Linux} scheme.

On 2.6 @b{Linux} kernels that support the newer extended device numbers, external device numbers and
internal device numbers will be the same.  On 2.4 @b{Linux} kernels with the older 16-bit device
numbers, external device number and internal device numbers will differ.  In some situations, an
internal device number can exists with no corresponding external device number (accessed only via a
clone device or direct access to the mounted @file{specfs} shadow special character device
filesystem).
