.SH NAME

\- test for a \fISTREAMS\fR special file
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <stropts.h>
.HP
.BI "int isastream(int " fd );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the file descriptor to test.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR isastream ()
tests whether the open file associated with the file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
is a
.I STREAMS
special file.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR isastream ()
is normally used by an applications program to determine whether
.I STREAMS
input-output controls,
.BR streamio (7),
are possible on a specific special file,
.IR fd .
For example,
.BR isastream ()
can be used to determine whether the pipe returned by a call to
.BR pipe (2s)
is a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe or a
.IR "SVR 3" -style
pipe.
Also,
.BR isastream ()
can be used to determine whether the pseudo-terminal returned by a call to
.BR openpt (3tty)
is a
.IR STREAMS -based
master pseudo-terminal or an
.IR "SVR 3" -style
pseudo-terminal.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
.BR isastream ()
returns true,
.RB ( 1 ),
if the file associated with
.IR fd
is a
.I STREAMS
special file; it return false,
.RB ( 0 ),
if it is not, and returns
minus one
.RB ( -1 ),
on failure and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR isastream ()
fails, it returns minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBEBADF\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EBADF ]
The argument,
.IR fd ,
is not associted with an open file.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.SS Multi-Threading
.PP
.BR isastream ()
is thread-safe.
.BR isastream ()
does not contain an asynchrnous thread cancellation point, in accordance with
POSIX.
.[
susv3
.]
Asynchronous thread cancellation is deferred across the call.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B isastream ()
is system call emulated by the
.BR libstreams (3)
library by calling the
.BR I_ISASTREAM (7)
.I STREAMS
input-output control on
.IR fd ,
and adjusting the return value appropriately.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR isastream ()
has no known bugs.
Behaviour is validated using the
.BR test-streams (8)
test case executable and the
.I @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.B autotest
conformance test suite.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR isastream ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR isastream ()
is implemented as a
.I STREAMS
input-output control instead of a system call.  This should not affect
portablility.
.IP \(em
.BR isastream ()
conforms as closely as possible to the
.I POSIX/SUSv3
.[
susv3
.]
specifications.  Where a specific
.IR "SVR 4.2" -based
implementation differs from
.IR POSIX/SUSv3 ,
there will be differences with this
.I @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
application programs will expect conformance to
.IR POSIX/SUSv3 .
.PP
If your
.B Linux
system is equipped with
.I OpenGroup
manual pages, see
.BR isastream (3p)
for the equivalent
.IR POSIX/SUSv3
reference page.
