.TH WRITE 2 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ System Calls"
.SH NAME
.B write
\- write to a file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t write(int " fd ", const void *" buf ", size_t " count );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B write
writes up to
.I count
bytes to the file referenced by the file descriptor
.I fd
from the buffer starting at
.I buf.
POSIX requires that a \fBread()\fP which can be proved to occur after a
\fBwrite()\fP has returned returns the new data.  Note that not all file
systems are POSIX conforming.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, the number of bytes written are returned (zero indicates
nothing was written).  On error, \-1 is returned, and \fIerrno\fP is set
appropriately.  If \fIcount\fP is zero and the file descriptor refers to
a regular file, 0 will be returned without causing any other effect.
For a special file, the results are not portable.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for writing.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I fd
is attached to an object which is unsuitable for writing.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I buf
is outside your accessible address space.
.TP
.B EFBIG
An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the implementation-defined
maximum file size or the process' file size limit, or to write at a position
past than the maximum allowed offset.
.TP
.B EPIPE
.I fd
is connected to a pipe or socket whose reading end is closed.  When this
happens the writing process will receive a
.B SIGPIPE
signal; if it catches, blocks or ignores this the error
.B EPIPE
is returned.
.TP
.B EAGAIN
Non-blocking I/O has been selected using
.B O_NONBLOCK
and the write would block.
.TP
.B EINTR
The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was written.
.TP
.B ENOSPC
The device containing the file referred to by
.I fd
has no room for the data.
.TP
.B EIO
A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.
.PP
Other errors may occur, depending on the object connected to
.IR fd .
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, 4.3BSD.  SVr4 documents additional error
conditions EDEADLK, ENOLCK, ENOLNK, ENOSR, ENXIO, EPIPE, or ERANGE.
Under SVr4 a write may be interrupted and return EINTR at any point,
not just before any data is written.
