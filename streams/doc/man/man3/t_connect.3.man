.SH NAME
.B t_connect
\- establish a transport connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_connect(int " fd ", struct t_call *" sndcall ", struct t_call *" rcvcall );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP 12
.I fd
the transport endpoint to connect.
.TP
.I sndcall
a pointer to a
.B t_call
structure specifying the peer address, options and data.
.TP
.I rcvcall
a pointer to a
.B t_call
structure returning the responding address, options and data.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I fd
is the file descriptor of the local transport endpoint.
.PP
.I sndcall
is a
.B t_call
structure that specifies the address of the peer and the options and
connection data to send to the peer.
.PP
.I rcvcall
is a
.B t_call
structure that specifies the responding address, response options and
connection data received from the peer.
.PP
The
.IR sndcall " and " rcvcall
are
.B t_call
structures that specify the called and responding addresses.  The
.B t_call
structure is formated as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_call {
        struct netbuf addr;             /* address */
        struct netbuf opt;              /* options */
        struct netbuf udata;            /* user data */
        int sequence;                   /* sequence number */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.TP 12
.I addr
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure specifying the area and length of the protocol address.
.I sndcall->addr
passes in on call the called address for the connection, if any.
.I sndcall->addr.len
is significant and
.I sndcall->addr.maxlen
is not.
.I rcvcall->addr
returns the responding address for the connection, if any.
.I rcvcall->addr.maxlen
is significant on call and
.I rcvcall->addr.len
is significant on return.
.TP 12
.I opt
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure specifying the area and length of the connection options.
.I sndcall->opt
passes in on call the local connection options.
.I sndcall->opt.len
is significant and
.I sndcall->opt.maxlen
is not.
.I rcvcall->opt
returns the remote connection options.
.I rcvcall->opt.maxlen
is significant on call and
.I rcvcall->opt.len
is significant on return.
.TP 12
.I udata
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure specifying the area and length of the connection data.
.I sndcall->udata
passes in on call the local connection data.
.I sndcall->udata.len
is significant and
.I sndcall->udata.maxlen
is not.
.I rcvcall->udata
returns the remote connection data.
.I rcvcall->udata.maxlen
is significant on call and
.I rcvcall->udata.len
is significant on return.
.TP 12
.I sequence
is not significant in the
.BR t_connect ()
call.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_connect ()
is only valid in state
.BR T_IDLE .
.PP
In syncrhonous mode,
.BR t_connect ()
blocks until it successfully receives a connection confirmation.
In asynchronous mode (i.e.
.BR O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
is set with
.BR t_open "(3) or " fcntl (2)),
.BR t_connect ()
will return immediately after failing to read a connection confirmation
with a a return value of -1 and
.IR t_errno (3)
set to
.BR T_NODATA .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_connect ()
returns zero (0), confirms the connection request and provides the responding
address, options and connection data in the
.I rcvcall
.B t_call
structure.
Upon failure,
.BR t_connect ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_connect ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP 12
.RB [ TACCES ]
The caller did not have sufficient permissions to use the address or options specified in
.IR sndcall->addr " or " sndcall->opt .
.TP 12
.RB [ TADDRBUSY ]
The
.I sndcall->addr
specificed was already in use by another transport endpoint.
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADADDR ]
The
.I sndcall->addr
specified was of an invalid format or contained invalid information.
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADDATA ]
The amount of data specified for the call
.I sndcall->udata.len
provider was invalid for the underlying transport service (i.e. was outside
the protocol limits).  See
.BR t_getinfo "(3) and " t_open (3)
for more information.
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADOPT ]
The options specified were of an invalid format or contained invalid information.
See
.BR t_optmgmt (3)
for more information on option formats.
.TP 12
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The
.I maxlen
field of a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure,
.IR rcvcall->addr.maxlen ", " rcvcall->opt.maxlen " or " rcvcall->udata.maxlen ,
passed to the call was non-zero, but insufficient to hold the available opaque
information.  See,
.BR netbuf (3)
for more information.
.TP 12
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP 12
.RB [ TNODATA ]
An attempt was made to read a connection confirmation but
.I fd
was set for non-blocking operation with
.BR O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
and no connection confirmation was available.
The connection confirmation can be retrieved later with
.BR t_rcvconnect (3).
.TP 12
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP 12
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP 12
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP 12
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
