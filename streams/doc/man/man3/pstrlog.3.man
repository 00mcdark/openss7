.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR pstrlog ()
prints the error, trace or console log buffer,
with control part
.I ctrl
and data part
.IR data ,
obtained from the
.BR log (4)
driver directly with a call to
.BR getmsg (2)
to the file stream,
.IR file .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR pstrlog ()
is intended for use by the
.BR strerr (1)
logging daemon, or application programs reading from the
.BR log (4)
driver in a manner similar to the
.BR strerr (1)
or
.BR strace (1)
loggers.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
Upon success,
.BR pstrlog ()
returns the number of characters printed (not including the trailing '\0' used
to end string output).
Upon failure, minus one (-1) and an appropriate error number in
.IR errno (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR pstrlog ()
fails, it returns minus one (-1) and an apporpriate error number in
.IR errno (3)
as follows:
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
the message contained in
.I ctrl
or
.I data
is invalid or of an improper format.
.PP
In general, any error returned by
.BR fprintf (3)
can be returned by
.BR pstrlog ().

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR pstrlog ()
is compatibile with
.I "SVR 4.2"
.[
svr42
.]
and systems based on 
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR pstrlog ()
is specific to
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
Most implementations of the
.BR log (4)
driver do not provide a mechanism for printing a log buffer.
.BR pstrlog ()
is provided to remove the dependency on the specific format of the log buffer
from a
.BR log (4)
driver application program.
