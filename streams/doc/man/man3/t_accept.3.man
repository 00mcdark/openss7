.TH T_ACCEPT 3 "$Date: 2004/03/01 02:44:05 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux Fast-STREAMS XTI Library"
.SH NAME
.B t_accept
\- accept a connection request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_accept(int" fd ", int " resfd ", struct t_call *" call );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP 12
.I fd
the transport endpoint upon which a connection indication was received.
.TP
.I resfd
the transport endpoint upon which to accept the connection.
.TP
.I call
a pointer to a 
.B t_call
structure containing information about the responding endpoint and any data to
be transferred in response.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I fd
argument is an integer file descriptor specifying the stream upon which a
previous connection indication was received with
.BR t_listen (3),
and for which the connection indication is to now be accepted.
.PP
The
.I resfd
argument is an integer file descriptor specifying the stream upon which to
accept the transport connection.
.I resfd
can be the same as
.I fd
or different.
When
.I resfd
is different from
.IR fd ,
the caller specifies that the connection is to be accepted on the stream
associated with
.IR resfd .
When
.I resfd
is different from
.IR fd ,
the stream associated with
.I resfd
must be an XTI/TLI
.[

stream on the same transport provider that is either in the
.B T_UNBND
state, or is in the
.B T_IDLE
state and bound to the same address as the responding address.
.PP
The
.I call
argument is a pointer to a
.B t_call
structure,
specifying the responding address,
.IR addr ,
the response options,
.IR opt ,
and any response user data,
.IR udata .
formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_call {
        struct netbuf addr;     /* address              */
        struct netbuf opt;      /* options              */
        struct netbuf udata;    /* data                 */
        int sequence;           /* identification       */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.IR addr ", " opt " and " udata
members of the
.B t_call
structure are
.BR netbuf (3)
structures, each formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct netbuf {
        unsigned int maxlen;    /* max length           */
        unsigned int len;       /* current length       */
        char *buf;              /* data                 */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.TP 12
.I addr
A
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that specifies the responding address.  The reponding address is the
address accepting the connection.
.I call->addr.maxlen
is set to zero (0) by the caller and ignored by the provider.
.I call->addr.len
is set to the length of the responding address.  If the length of the
responding address is zero (0) then the destination address of the connection
indication is used as the responding address.
.I call->addr.buf
points to the responding address.
.TP 12
.I opt
A
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that specifies the responding options.  The responding options can be
both end-to-end and local transport options.
.I call->opt.maxlen
is set to zero (0) by the caller and is ignored by the provider.
.I call->opt.len
is set to the length of the options.  If the length of the responding options
is zero (0) no options are specified.
.I call->opt.buf
points to the options.
.TP 12
.I udata
A
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that specifies the data to send with the connection
response.
.I call->udata.maxlen
is set to zero (0) by the caller and is ignored by the provider.
.I call->udata.len
is set to the length of the data.  If the length of the data is zero (0) no
data is included in the response message.
.I call->udata.buf
points to the data.
.TP 12
.I sequence
specifies a sequence number of the connection indication that is to be
accepted.  This value was returned by a previous call to
.BR t_listen (3).
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_accept ()
is only valid in state
.B T_INCON
with an outstanding number of connection indications greater than zero (0).
.PP
.BR t_accept ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_COTS " or " T_COTS_ORD .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_accept ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_accept ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_accept ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP 12
.RB [ TACCES ]
The caller did not have sufficient permissions to accept a connection on the
.I resfd
file descriptor, or did not have sufficient permissions to use the responding
address specified in
.IR call->addr .
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADADDR ]
The address specified was of an invalid format or contained invalid information.
This error is returned from the transport service provider.
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADDATA ]
The amount of data specified for the call and underlying transport service
provider was invalid (i.e. was outside the protocol limits).  See
\fBt_getinfo\fR(3) and \fBt_open\fR(3) for more information.
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADF ]
The
.IR fd " or " resfd
file descriptor was invalid.
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADOPT ]
The options specified were of an invalid format or contained invalid information.
This error is returned from the transport service provider.
See
.BR t_optmgmt (3)
for more information on option formats.
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADSEQ ]
The
.I sequence
number provided was invalid, or is not associated with an outstanding
connection indication.
.TP 12
.RB [ TINDOUT ]
The file descriptor
.I resfd
has outstanding connection indications.
.TP 12
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See \fBt_look\fR(3) for more information.
.TP 12
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP 12
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP 12
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP 12
.RB [ TPROVMISMATCH ]
The transport provider associated with
.I resfd
is not the same as the transport provider associated with
.IR fd .
.TP 12
.RB [ TRESADDR ]
The file descriptor
.I resfd
was bound to a different address than the responding address.
.TP 12
.RB [ TRESQLEN ]
The file descriptor
.I resfd
is listening (i.e. it was bound with a
.I qlen
> 0).
.TP 12
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fR system error occured and the \fBLinux\fR error number is set in \fIerrno\fR(3).
