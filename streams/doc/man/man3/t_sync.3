.TH T_SYNC 3 "$Date: 2004/02/29 19:06:48 $" "$Name:  $"" "Linux Fast-STREAMS XTI Library"
.SH NAME
.B t_sync
\- synchronize XTI library with TLI provider
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_sync(int " fd );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP 12
.I fd
the transport endpoint to sync.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Synchronizes the XTI library for
.I fd
with the underlying TLI transport service provider.
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint file descriptor to synchronize.
.PP
.BR t_sync ()
should be called whenever a new file descriptor is generated from an old one
or when
.RB [ TPROTO ]
was retruned as an error in
.IR t_errno (3)
for a previous XTI library call.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_sync ()
is valid in any state other than
.BR T_UNINIT .
.PP
The
.BR OpenSS7
implementation of the XTI library minimizes the necessity for using
.BR t_sync ()
due to a specialized
.BR timod (4)
module that tracks the state of the underlying transport service provider
independent of the accessing process or file descriptor.  See
.BR timod (4)
for more information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_sync ()
returns a positive integer reflecting the state of the transport interface.
Upon failure,
.BR t_sync ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_sync ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP 12
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP 12
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP 12
.RB [ TSTATECHNG ]
The interface is in a transient state.
.TP 12
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
