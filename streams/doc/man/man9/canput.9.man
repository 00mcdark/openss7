.SH NAME

\- test flow control on a \fISTREAMS\fP message queue
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int canput(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue from which to begin testing for flow control.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
driver putting a band zero (0)
normal message to the driver's read queue (e.g. with
.BR put "(9) or " putq (9))
to check for flow control using
.BR canput ()
before placing a message on the queue with
.BR put "(9) or " putq (9).
.PP
.BR canput ()
checks whether the
Stream
is flow controlled starting at the
specified queue,
.IR q .
Starting at the
.I q
specified,
.BR canput ()
looks for the next queue which has a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure or which has no next queue (i.e. the
.I q->q_next
pointer is
.BR NULL ).
.PP
If this queue has the
.B QFULL
flag clear indicating that it is not full,
then
.BR canput ()
will return
.I true
.RB ( 1 ).
.PP
If this queue has the
.B QFULL
flag set indicating that it is full,
then
.BR canput ()
will return
.I false
.RB ( 0 ).
.PP
When
.BR canput ()
returns
.I false
.RB ( 0 ),
it also sets the
.B QWANTW
flag for that queue upon which
.BR canput ()
stopped,
indicating that the
.I STREAMS
scheduler should back-enable
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedures feeding the flow controlled queue once the flow controlled
queue is no longer full (i.e. message have been read from the queue to reduce
the queue size to the low water mark for the queue, clearing the
.B QFULL
flag).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
It is the responsibility of all
.I STREAMS
driver putting
a normal (zero band) data message
.RB ( M_PROTO "(9), " M_DATA (9))
to a message queue to check for flow control using
.BR canput ()
before placing a message on the queue with
.BR put (9)
or
.BR putq (9).
Each
Stream head,
Stream end
and multiplexing driver
is responsible for checking flow control before passing a message onto a
Stream.
Flow control is checked using one of
.BR canput ()
or
.BR bcanput (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR canput ()
will return
.I false
.RB ( 0 )
when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is flow controlled
and returns
.I true
.RB ( 1 )
when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is not flow controlled.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR canput ()
always succeeds for a valid
.IR q .
If
.I q
is invalid, the result is undefined.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR canput ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
When called from outside a synchronous context [see
.BR mp-streams (9)],
.I q
must have a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR canput ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.PP
When wishing to test flow control on a driver's read queue from an interrupt service routine, where
there is no
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure defined for the read queue, call
.BR put (9)
instead and test flow control from within the read queue's
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure.
Another, less portable, alternative is to bracket the call to
.BR canput ()
with
.BR freezestr (9)
and
.BR unfreezestr (9).
.PP
It is possible, due to race conditions in a
.I Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP)
system, that
.BR canput ()
can be called for a queue and return
.I true
.RB ( 1 )
and yet the
Stream
becomes flow controlled before a
call to
.BR putq (9).
The caller to
.BR putq (9)
is then in violation of flow-control rules; however, the extent of this violation is bounded.
.PP
Although
.BI canput( q->q_next )
is functionally equivalent to
.BI canputnext( q ),
for the
.BR canput (9)
form, the dereference of the
.I q->q_next
pointer is not protected on MP architectures and may change as a result of a
concurrent reconfiguration of the
Stream
(e.g. an
.BR I_PUSH " or " I_POP
.BR streamio (7)
operation).
For MP operation,
.BI canput( q->q_next )
should not be called and
.BR canputnext (9)
should always be called instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
driver putting a band zero (0)
.I normal
message to a message queue to check for flow control using
.BR canput ()
before placing a message on the queue with
.BR put (9)
or
.BR putq (9).
.PP
.BR canputnext (9)
and
.BR bcanputnext (9)
should always be used instead of
.BI canput( q->q_next )
or
.BI bcanput( q->q_next )
on multiprocessor (MP) systems.
.PP
.BR canput ()
and
.BR canputnext (9)
are the equivalent of
.BR bcanput (9)
and
.BR bcanputnext (9)
with a zero
.IR band :
and in fact can be implemented as such.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR canput ()
uses atomic bit operations and does not require locking of the queue
structure.  Therefore,
.BR canput ()
can be called for a
.I q
that is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.PP
.BR canput ()
and
.BR canputnext (9)
are the equivalent of
.BR bcanput (9)
and
.BR bcanputnext (9)
with a zero
.IR band :
and in fact can be implemented as such.

.SH EXAMPLES
.\"
.SS Example #1
.PP
.BR canput ()
is normally called before a call to
.BR putq (9)
as follows:
.sp

.fi
.PP
Above, the example uses
.BR canput ()
from the lower queue
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure (in a multiplexing driver) to test the upper queue for flow
control.  If the upper queue is flow controlled, the message is placed on the lower queue.
Otherwise, if the lower queue is empty and the upper queue is not flow controlled, the example
places the message directly on the upper queue.

.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Because all

drivers and modules should be aware of queue priority bands when performing flow control,
use of
.BR canput ()
is not very useful and the band aware
.BR bcanput (9)
should be used in its stead.
.BR canput ()
is only provided for use by modules and drivers that either have no need to support queue bands
(e.g., on a driver read queue for a driver that never places non-zero priority messages on the
queue), or were written to the earlier
.I "SVR 3"
.[
svr3

specification that did not include queue bands.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and reusable modules will call
.BR bcanput (9)
instead of
.BR canput ()
in all cases where it cannot be guaranteed that the driver or module will not receive a non-zero
priority message to the queue.  (Some might even go to the extent of setting
.I b_band
to zero in all messages received by the
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure.
.IP \(em
