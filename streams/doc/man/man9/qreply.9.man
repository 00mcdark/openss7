.TH QREPLY 9 "$Date: 2004/03/14 08:56:36 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux Fast-STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B qreply
\- replys to a message from a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void qreply(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue from which to reply.
.TP
.I mp
the message to reply with.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qreply ()
replies, with the message pointed to by
.IR mp ,
to the read queue that is upstream from the specified write queue
pointed to by
.IR q ,
or the write queue downstream from the specified read queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.PP
.BR qreply ()
is normally used within
.IR q 's
.BR put (9)
or
.BR srv (9)
procedure to reply to messages that have arrived on its write queue from
upstream, or its read queue from downstream.
.PP
It is the responsibility of the procedure calling
.BR qreply ()
with a normal message pointer to by
.I mp
to first call
.BR canputnext (9)
or
.BR bcanputnext (9)
for the queue to check for flow control.  If
.BR canputnext (9)
or
.BR bcanputnext (9)
fails for queue
.IR q ,
the procedure should not normally invoke
.BR qreply ()
with a low priority message for the flow controlled queue
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next .
.PP
.BR qreply ()
will wake up any processes waiting with
.BR qwait (9)
or
.BR qwait_sig (9)
on the previous queue
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qreply ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qreply ()
fails silently when a queue band structure cannot be allocated for the band
specified in
.IR mp->b_band .
The caller can ensure that a queue band structure exists for the band in
question by calling
.BR strqset (9)
for the band.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BI qreply( q ", " mp )
has the same effect as
.BI putnext(OTHERQ( q "), " mp )).
Because
.BR qreply ()
invokes the put procedure of the upstream or downstream queue, the same care
should be taken with
.BR qreply ()
as is taken with
.BR putnext (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qreply ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qreply ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to the
passed in message block.  The caller should remove all global references to
the passed in message block before calling
.BR qreply ().
.PP
.BR qreply ()
whould always be used in the MP environment in preference to
.BI put(OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next ", " mp )
because the later does not protect dereference of the
.I q_next
pointer.
.BI putnext(OTHERQ( q "), " mp )
would be an acceptable alternative.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR OTHERQ (9),
.BR putnext (9),
.BR putq (9).

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qreply ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBLITY
.PP
.BR qreply ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
LiS
.[
LiS
.]
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\ \(em\ 'u
.BR qreply ()
fails silently and frees
.I mp
if a queue band structure cannot be allocated on demand for
.IR mp->b_band .
Under LiS,
.BR qreply ()
fails silently and frees
.I mp
if
the message pointer
.I mp
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ,
or
.BI OTHERQ( q )
is
.BR NULL ;
.BI OTHERQ( q )
does not refer to a queue structure;
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
is
.BR NULL ;
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
does not refer to a queue structure;
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next->q_info
is
.BR NULL ,
or
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
does not have a put procedure;
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
has put and service procedures turned off (e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.IP \(em
.BR qreply ()
protects dereference of the
.I q_next
pointer with the stream head read lock.
SVR 4.2 MP and
.IR Solaris \(rg
offer the same protection.
Under LiS,
.BR qreply ()
does not protect dereference of the
.I q_next
pointer against module pushes and pops.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
do not permit
.BR qreply ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
See
.BR putnext (9)
for additional information.
.PP
Symbol
.BR lis_safe_qreply ()
is provided for binary compatibility with LiS.  See
.BR lisbcm (9).
.BR lis_safe_qreply ()
simply calls
.BR qreply ().
.PP
Binary compatibility with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI and
.IR Solaris \(rg
is not guaranteed.
