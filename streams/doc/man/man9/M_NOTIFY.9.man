.SH NAME
.B M_NOTIFY
\- \fISTREAMS\fP notification message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_NOTIFY
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_NOTIFY
message is a high priority message that consists a single
.B M_NOTIFY
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_NOTIFY
message is generated and sent downstream by the
.I Stream head
when a message with the
.B MSGNOTIFY
flag set in the
.I b_flag
member of the first message block is read by a user level process.
.PP
The format of the message is a single
.BR M_NOTIFY
message block that contains unstructured data.
The contents of the message is poorly documented.
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs
.]
.I Stream head
places a pointer to the original message block that was marked with
.B MSGNOTIFY
into the data buffer of the
.B M_NOTIFY
message so that the receiving module or driver can match the notification to the message that was so
marked. (???)
.PP
If an
.BR M_NOTIFY
message is received by the
.IR "Stream head" ,
it is discarded.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B M_NOTIFY
message is used by some implementations of
.BR ldterm (4)
.RI ( AIX \(rg,
.[
aixspg
.]
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.[
hpuxspg
.]
and
.IR OSF/1 \(rg.)
.[

.]
.PP
The process used by the
.B M_NOTIFY
message and the behavior of the
.IR "Stream head" ,
modules and drivers is poorly documented, however, under
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs
.]
the following behaviour is implemented:
.IP (1) \w'(0)\(em'u
A module or driver wishing
.I Stream head
notification when a data message
.RB ( M_PROTO (9),
.BR M_PCPROTO (9),
or
.BR M_DATA (9))
passed upstream is read by a user level process, 
marks the message to request notification by setting the
.B MSGNOTIFY
flag in the
.I b_flag
member of the first message block of the data message, and passes the message upstream.
.IP (2)
When a data message marked with
.B MSGNOTIFY
arrives at the
.I Stream head
and is delivered (fully or in part) to the user level process, the
.I Stream head
formulates an
.B M_NOTIFY
message to be passed downstream as notification.
.IP (3)
The contents of the
.B M_NOTIFY
message is implementation specific, however,
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs
.]
(does what ????).
.IP (4)
When the requesting module or driver receives the
.B M_NOTIFY
message from the
.IR "Stream head" ,
it is notified of the fact that the oldest outstanding message that was marked with a
.B MSGNOTIFY
flag was delivered.  The module or driver can use the pointer from the
.B M_NOTIFY
message to match the outstanding message with the notification.
.PP
Guidelines for processing of the
.B M_NOTIFY
message in modules and drivers is as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
If an intermediate module recognizes, but is not processing the
.B M_NOTIFY
message, it passes it downstream.  As a high priority message, the
.B M_NOTIFY
message is not subject to flow control and should not be queued.
.IP \(bu
If an intermediate module does not recognize the
.B M_NOTIFY
message, it passes it upstream or downstream as with any unrecognized high priority message: it is
not subject to flow control and should not be queued.
.IP \(bu
If a driver receives an
.B M_NOTIFY
message and does not recognize the message, it is discarded.  If the driver is not processing
notifications, the message is discarded.
.IP \(bu
If an intermediate module or the driver recognizes the
.B M_NOTIFY
message and is awaiting notification for a previous message passed upstream marked with the
.B MSGNOTIFY
flag in
.IR b_flag ,
it treats the message as acknowledgement of the read and frees the message.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_NOTIFY
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Only
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixspg
.]
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfspg
.]
and
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.[
hpuxspg
.]
document the
.BR M_NOTIFY (9)
data block type.
This data block type is provided for source compatibility with drivers written
for
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixspg
.]
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfspg
.]
or
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.[
hpuxspg
.]
and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers.
It might be necessary to define
.BR _AIX_SOURCE ,
.BR _OSF_SOURCE ,
or
.B _HPUX_SOURCE
before including
.B sys/stream.h
to expose this symbol.
.IP ""
Portable
