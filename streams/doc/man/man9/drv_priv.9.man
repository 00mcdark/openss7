.SH NAME
.B drv_priv
\- check if the current process is priviledged
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/dki.h>
.HP
.BI "int drv_priv(cred_t *" crp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I crp
a pointer to the credentials to test for priveledge.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR drv_priv (),
when given a references to a process'
.BR cred_t (9)
credentials structure, returns a value indicating whether the specified
credentials are priviledged or not.
.BR drv_priv ()
is an
SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
DDI/DKI function intended to insulate the
.I STREAMS
driver or module from the internals of the
.BR cred_t (9)
credentials structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
returns true (1) if the process is priviledged; it returns false (0) if the
process is not priviledged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
can be executed from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
is MP-safe, however, the caller is resposible for ensuring exclusive access to
the passed in credentials.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
simply checks if either the real user id or effective user id is the root user
id (equal to zero).
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
is a crude way of checking permissions.  Capabilities,
.BR capable (9),
and secure access lists
should be used instead.  New programs should use Linux functions directly.

.BR drv_priv ()
has no known bugs.

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI and
.IR Solaris \(rg.
It is provided for the purpose of porting
SVR 4.2 and

drivers to
.IR Linux \(rg.
Binary compatibility with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI and
.IR Solaris \(rg
is not guaranteed.
.I LiS
