.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "queue_t *backq(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to find the previous queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR backq ()
returns a pointer to the queue behind a given queue.  That is, it returns a pointer to the queue
whose
.I q_next
pointer is
.IR q .
If no such queue exists (as when
.I q
is at a
Stream head
or
.IR "Stream end" ),
.BR backq ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.PP
.BR backq ()
returns a pointer to the queue
which feeds messages to
.IR q .
.\".PP
.\"If
.\".I q
.\"references a normal read queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
.\"downstream queue.  If
.\".I q
.\"references a normal write queue, then the returned queue pointer references
.\"the upstream queue.
.\".PP
.\"If
.\".I q
.\"references a
.\".BR fifo (4)
.\"read queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
.\".BR fifo (4)
.\"write queue.  If
.\".I q
.\"references a
.\".BR fifo (4)
.\"write queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
.\".BR fifo (4)
.\"read queue.
.\".PP
.\"If
.\".I q
.\"references a
.\".BR pipe (4)
.\"read queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
.\"write queue at the other end of the
.\".BR pipe (4).
.\"If
.\".I q
.\"references a
.\".BR pipe (4)
.\"write queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
.\"read queue at the other end of the
.\".BR pipe (4).

.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR backq ()
is problematic in MP systems.
MP-safe drivers and modules should avoid using this function.
When
.BR backq ()
is absolutely necessary, it should only be called from a module procedure and
should only be passed a
.I q
belonging to the queue pair for which a module procedure is sycncrhonised.
.PP
Normally it is unnecessary to know the queue feeding a given queue.
.I STREAMS
utilities
.BR getq (9)
and
.BR rmvq (9)
handle back-enabling.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR backq ()
returns a pointer to the feeding queue, or
.B NULL
when there is no feeding queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR backq ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR backq ()
in the Uni-Processor (UP) environment can be called from any context, including user context, module
procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.PP
.BR backq ()
can be called (without any special treatment) in the Symetric Multi-Processing (SMP) environment
from within
.I STREAMS
module procedures, syncrhonous callouts and callbacks, but not (without special treatment) from
outside the
.I STREAMS
context, including asynchronous callbacks.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR backq ()
is MP-safe; however, when called from outside of the
.I STREAMS
context, the returned queue reference might no longer be valid
after the return from
.BR backq ()
if an
.BR I_PUSH (7),
or
.BR I_POP (7),
of a module has been performed on the queue
.IR q ,
or the queue
.I q
has been welded with
.BR weldq (9),
or unwelded with
.BR unweldq (9).
.PP
If, from outside the
.I STREAMS
context, the
Stream
is frozen using
.BR freezestr (9)
before the call to
.BR backq (),
the returned queue reference will be valid until after a call to
.BR unfreezestr (9),
or the queue pointers are otherwise manipulated by the caller.
.PP
The caller is responsible for the validity of the reference
.IR q .
References to
.I q
from
.I STREAMS
context (module procedure, syncrhonous callout or callback predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs) are guaranteed valid.  The caller must guarantee validity from a
.RI non- STREAMS
context (process context, asyncrhonous callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines).
In general,
.I q
is valid from the moment that
.BR qprocson (9)
returns to the module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure, until the moment that
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is called from the module
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR backq (),
is obsolete.
.\"There are no utility functions that protect dereference of the
.\".BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
.\"across the return from the call (such as
.\".I q->q_next
.\"is protected by, for example,
.\".BR putnext (9)).
.\".BR backq (),
.\"should not be used by portable MP-safe modules.

.SH BUGS

has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR backq ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4"
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxdoc
.]
does not document this function.
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
lists
.BR backq ()
as a function that can only be passed a queue in the queue pair currently
being synchronized within a module procedure.  See
.IR \*(lqNOTICES\*(rq ,
above.
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
returns
.B NULL
if
.I q
points to a stream end read queue, regardless of whether a FIFO or PIPE
midpoint exists beyond
.IR q .
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixdoc
.]
and
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
indicate that the returned pointer is
.B NULL
if
.I q
is a stream head write queue or a stream end read queue.
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
returns
.B NULL
if
.I q
points to a stream end read queue, regardless of whether a FIFO or PIPE
midpoint exists beyond
.IR q .
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7doc
.]
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
.[
uxpdoc
.]
do not explicitly document what happens in the case of FIFOs and PIPEs, but
indicate that the queue pointer returned is that whose
.I q_next
pointer points to
.IR q .
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
will kernel oops if
.I q
is
.BR NULL .
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR backq ()
will return
.B NULL
if
.I q
is
.BR NULL .
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
will destabilize the kernel if
.I q
is a
.RB non- NULL
pointer to a structure other than a valid
.B queue_t
structure.
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR backq ()
will return
.B NULL
in the same situation.
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
always succeeds.
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR backq ()
will fail silently and return
.B NULL
in the two situations above, and when an internal error occurs.
.IP \(em
Symbol

directly.

Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
