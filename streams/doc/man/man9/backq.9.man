.SH NAME
.B backq
\- find the upstream or downstream queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "queue_t *backq(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to find the previous queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR backq ()
returns a pointer to the queue
which feeds messages to
.IR q .
.PP
If
.I q
references a normal read queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
downstream queue.  If
.I q
references a normal write queue, then the returned queue pointer references
the upstream queue.
.PP
If
.I q
references a FIFO read queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
FIFO write queue.  If
.I q
references a FIFO write queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
FIFO read queue.
.PP
If
.I q
references a PIPE read queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
write queue at the other end of the PIPE.  If
.I q
references a PIPE write queue, then the returned queue pointer references the
read queue at the other end of the PIPE.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR backq ()
returns a pointer to the feeding queue, or
.B NULL
when there is no feeding queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR backq ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR backq ()
is problematic in MP systems.
MP-safe drivers and modules should avoid using this function.
When
.BR backq ()
is absolutely necessary, it should only be called from a module procedure and
should only be passed a
.I q
belonging to the queue pair for which a module procedure is sycncrhonized.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR backq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR backq ()
is MP-safe; however, the returned queue reference might no longer be valid if
a push or pop of a module has been made by the queue, or the queue has been
linked under a multiplexing driver, after return from
.BR backq ().
.PP
If the stream and queue is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9),
then the returned queue reference will be valid until the stream is thawed
with
.BR unfreezestr (9),
or the queue pointers are manipulated by the caller.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR backq (),
is obsolete.
There are no utility functions that protect dereference of the
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
across the return from the call (such as
.I q->q_next
is protected by, for example,
.BR putnext (9)).
.BR backq (),
should not be used by portable MP-safe modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR freezestr (9),
.BR unfreezestr (9),
.BR strqget (9),
.BR strqset (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR backq ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR backq ()
is compatible with
.BR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.BR "SVR 4"
with the following portablity considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\ \(em\ 'u
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxdoc
.]
does not document this function.
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
lists
.BR backq ()
as a function that can only be passed a queue in the queue pair currently
being synchronized within a module procedure.  See
.IR \*(lqNOTICES\*(rq ,
above.
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
returns
.B NULL
if
.I q
points to a stream end read queue, regardless of whether a FIFO or PIPE
midpoint exists beyond
.IR q .
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixdoc
.]
and
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
indicate that the returned pointer is
.B NULL
if
.I q
is a stream head write queue or a stream end read queue.
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
returns
.B NULL
if
.I q
points to a stream end read queue, regardless of whether a FIFO or PIPE
midpoint exists beyond
.IR q .
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7doc
.]
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
.[
uxpdoc
.]
do not explicitly document what happens in the case of FIFOs and PIPEs, but
indicate that the queue pointer returned with that whose
.I q_next
pointer points to
.IR q .
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
will kernel oops if
.I q
is
.BR NULL .
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR backq ()
will return
.B NULL
if
.I q
is
.BR NULL .
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
will destabilize the kernel if
.I q
is a
.RB non- NULL
pointer to a structure other than a valid
.B queue_t
structure.
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR backq ()
will return
.B NULL
in the same situation.
.IP \(em
.BR backq ()
always succeeds.
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR backq ()
will fail silently and return
.B NULL
in the two situations above, and when an internal error occurs.
.IP \(em
Symbol
.BR lis_backq ()
is provide for compatibility with
.IR LiS .
See
.BR lisbcm (9).
.BR lis_backq ()
simply calls
.BR backq ()
directly.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

.BR STREAMS (9)
