.TH PUTQ 9 "$Date: 2004/02/29 19:07:38 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux Fast-STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B putq
\- puts a message on a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int putq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue on which the place the message.
.TP
.I mp
the message to place on the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR putq ()
places the message pointed to by
.I mp
on the queue
.I q
without invoking the queue's put procedure.
.PP
After placing the message on queue
.IR q ,
.BR putq ()
adjusts the queue's flags and byte counts appropriately and schedules the
queue service procedure when necessary.
.PP
It is the responsibility of a procedure calling
.BR putq ()
with a low priority message pointed to by
.I mp
to first call
.BR canput (9)
for the queue to check for flow control.
If
.BR canput (9)
fails for queue
.IR q ,
the procedure should not normally invoke
.BR putq ()
with a low priority message for the flow controlled queue
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR putq ()
returns true (1) and places the message pointed to by
.I mp
on the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
Upon failure,
.BR putq ()
returns false (0) and does not alter the passed in queue or message.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR putq ()
fails, it returns false (0).
.BR putq ()
only fails when a
.BR qband (9)
structure could not be allocated for a banded message arriving at a first use
empty band.
.BR putq ()
always succeeds for priority and normal band zero (0) messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR putq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.PP
.BR putq ()
called on a queue frozen by
.BR freezestr (9)
will result in single-party deadlock.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR putq ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
It can be guaranteed that
.BR putq ()
will always succeed, even for banded messages, by calling
.BR strqset (9)
to set the high and low water marks and packet sizes for all bands used by the
driver or module.
.PP
When
.BR putq ()
fails and returns zero (0), it is the callers responsibility to address the
disposition of the passed in message,
.IR mp .
A typical response would be to free the message using
.BR freemsg (9).
.\"
.\"

.PP

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR putq ()
has no known bugs.
