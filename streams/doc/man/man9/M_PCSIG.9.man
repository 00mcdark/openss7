.SH NAME
.B M_PCSIG
\- \fISTREAMS\fP priority signal message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_PCSIG
message is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains structured data.
.PP
An
.B M_PCSIG
message is a high priority message that consists of a single
.B M_PCSIG
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
As the
.BR M_SIG (9)
message, except for the priority.
.PP
.B M_PCSIG
is often preferable to the
.BR M_SIG (9)
message, especially in
.I tty
applications, because
.BR M_SIG (9)
may be queued while
.B M_PCSIG
is more guaranteed to get through quickly.  For example, if one generates an
.BR M_SIG (9)
message when the
delete-key is hit on the terminal and one has already typed ahead, the
.BR M_SIG (9)
message becomes queued and the user doesn't get the call until it's too late; it becomes impossible
to kill or interrupt a process by hitting a delete-key.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_PCSIG
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:

Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
