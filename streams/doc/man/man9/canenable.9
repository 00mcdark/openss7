.TH CANENABLE 9 "$Date: 2004/02/29 19:07:38 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux Fast-STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.\"
.\"
.SH "NAME"
.B canenable
\- test whether a message queue can be scheduled.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int canenable(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue to test whether a subsequent
.BR qenable (9)
can be successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR canenable ()
tests whether the queue pointed to by
.I q
can be enabled (service procedure scheduled for execution by
.BR runqueues (9))
by
.BR qenable (9).
.PP
This function is typically called before a call to
.BR qenable (9)
when the caller wishes to determine whether
.BR qenable (9)
will indeed result in the scheduling of the queue's
service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR canenable ()
returns true (1) if the queue pointed to by
.I q
can be enabled with
.BR qenable (9).
.PP
.BR canenable ()
returns false (0) if the queue pointed to by
.I q
cannot be enabled with
.BR qenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR canenable ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR canenable ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR canenable ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
Consideration should be given that the return may change before the condition
is tested if
.BR noenable (9)
or
.BR qprocsoff (9)
are allowed to execute concurrent with
.BR canenable ().
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR canenable ()
simply returns the result of testing the
.B QNOENB
bit.
.PP
Although it is MP-safe, it is questionable whether
.BR canenable ()
is usable in a Multiprocessor (MP) environment.
.BR canenable ()
tests atomic flags in the
.BR queue (9)
structure flags word that can be altered by other processors immediately
prior to, or subsequent to, the call to
.BR canenable ().
Therefore, there is always a race condition possible between
.BR canenable ()
and
.BR noenable (9),
.BR qprocsoff (9),
(or other utilities affecting the
.B QNOENB
flag in the
.BR queue (9)
flags word) on MP systems.
.PP
.BR canenable ()
might have some limited use on UP systems where interrupts can be locked out
across the call.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR qenable (9),
.BR qdisable (9),
.BR noenable (9),
.BR enableok (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR canenable ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR canenable ()
is compatible with
.BR "SVR 3 SPG"
.[
svr3spg
.]
and
.BR LiS,
.[
LiS
.]
with the following considerations:
.IP \(bu
A call to
.BR canenable ()
with a
.B NULL
.I q
or with a
.RB non- NULL
.I q
that points to other than a valid
.B queue_t
structure is invalid and the result in undefined.
.IP ""
When LiS
.BR qenable ()
encounters such an error, it will return false (0).
.IP \(bu
Symbol
.BR lis_safe_canenable ()
is provided for binary compatibility with LiS.  See
.BR lisbcm (9).
.BR lis_safe_canenable ()
simply calls
.BR canenable ()
directly.
.IP \(bu
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.IP \(bu
None of
.BR AIX \(rg,
.BR HP-UX \(rg,
.BR OSF \(rg,
.BR Solaris \(rg
or
.BR UnixWare \(rg
provide this function.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
