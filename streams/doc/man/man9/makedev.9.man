.HP
.BI "int makedev(int " majno ", int " minno );
.\"

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I majno
The major device number to combine into the device number.
.TP
.I minno
The minor device number to combine into the device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR makedev ()
returns the device number that results from combining the major device number,
.IR majno ,
with the minor device number,
.IR minno .
.BR makedev ()
is the
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
name for the
.BR makedevice (9)
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR makedev ()
returns the device number resulting from combining the major device number,
.IR majno ,
with the minro device number,
.IR minno .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR makedev ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR makedev ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR makedev ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR makedev () is the
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
name for
.BR makedevice (9).
.BR makedev ()
was renamed to
.BR makedevice (0)
with the advent of the DDI/DKI in
.IR "SVR 4" .
.PP
.BR makedevice (9)
should be used in preference to
.BR makedev ().
.BR makedev ()
should be be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.PP
.BR makedev ()
is a
.IR "SVR 3" -specific
macro that is present in system header file
.BR <sys/sysmacros.h> .
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR makedev ()
uses the glibc implementation in
.BR <sys/sysmacros.h> .

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR makedev ()
is compatible with
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 3" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR makedev ()
is implemented as an
.B extern inline
function.  Under
.IR "SVR 3" ,
.BR makedev ()
was implemented as an architecture dependent macro.
.IP \(em
.BR makedev ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.I SVR 3
for the purpose of porting
.I SVR 3
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 3" ,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR makedev ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.I SVR 3
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR makedev ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP

.BR STREAMS (9)
