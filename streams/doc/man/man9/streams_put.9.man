.SH NAME
.B streams_put
\- invoke the put procedure for a \fISTREAMS\fP driver or module with a \fISTREAMS\fP message
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _HPUX_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "typedef void (*" streams_put_t ")(void *, mblk_t *);
.HP
.BI "void streams_put(streams_put_t " func ", queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp ", void *" private );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I func
a function that will be called when write access has been acheived.
.TP
.I q
a pointer to the queue for which to upgrade to writer.
.TP
.I mp
a
.I STREAMS
message to pass to the call-out function.
.TP
.I private
a private pointer to pass to the call-out function.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
schedules the call-out function,
.IR func ,
to be executed with the private pointer,
.IR private ,
and the passed in message,
.IR mp ,
once the driver or module queue can be entered exclusively.
.PP
If there is no synchronization in effect for the queue,
.IR q ,
then this function has the same effect as calling
.I proc
directly with
.IR private " and " mp
as arguments.
.PP
It is typical to pass
.IR q
also in the
.I private
argument.
The call
.BI streams_put( &put ", " q ", " mp ", " q )
effectives calls the
.BR put (9)
function from outside of
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
allows
.RI non- STREAMS
software to safely call
.I STREAMS
utilities.
.RI Non- STREAMS
code can call
.BR streams_put (),
passing it a function and a queue pointer,
.IR q .
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
runs the function as if it were the queue's
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure.  The function can safely manipulate the queue and access the same data structures as the
queue's
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure.
.BR streams_put ()
passes
.I private
and
.I mp
to
.IR func .
The caller can pass any value it wishes in the
.I private
argument.
The caller must pass a valid message block pointer in
.IR mp ,
because
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
uses fields in the message block not visible to the
.I STREAMS
programmer.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR streams_put ()
fails, it fails silently.
.BR streams_put ()
fails when
.IR q
is invalid.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
is MP-safe and was intended to support MP-safe operation in the SMP
environment.
.PP
Considerations should be given when writing the call-out function that the
function may execute in parallel with asynchronous entry points, callbacks,
call-outs and interrupt service procedures.
.PP
However, in
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" ,
the call-out function is scheduled on the same CPU and the CPU which called
.BR streams_put ().
This means that
.BR streams_put ()
will return before the call-out function executes when called on the ICS.
Also, when called on the ICS, the call-out function will not execute before
the calling function returns or the next preemption point is encountered.
.PP
When called from any other context, the call-out function will execute before
the call returns.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _HPUX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_HPUX
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_HPUX_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses
a single mechanism,
.BR __strwrit (),
for supporting all queue writer functions such as
.BR qwriter (9)
and
.BR mps_become_writer (9),
and a single mechanism,
.BR __strfunc (),
for supporting all queue put function such as
.BR streams_put ().
.PP
When called on the ICS, execution of the call-out function is deferrred until
the next run of the
.I STREAMS
scheduler,
.BR strqsched (9),
and the function simply returns.
When called from any other context, synchronization is performed and the call-out function is executed immediately thereafter
and before returning.  See
.BR mp-streams (9)
for more information.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
is compatible with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR streams_put ()
is an
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The standard
.BR freezestr (9)
and
.BR put (9)
functions should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR streams_put ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR HP-UX \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR streams_put ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR HP-UX \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR streams_put ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR hpuxcompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
