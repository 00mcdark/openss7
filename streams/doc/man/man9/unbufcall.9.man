.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP

the buffer call identifier returned by

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
cancels the buffer callback that was installed using
.BR bufcall "(9) or " esbbcall (9).
.I bcid
is the buffer callback identifier that was returned from a previous call to
.BR bufcall "(9) or " esbbcall (9).
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
is typically used to remove outstanding buffer calls when a stream is closing.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR bufcall ()
silently fails if the buffer callback identified by
.I bcid
no longer exists;
or, 
.I bcid
is invalid.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
can be called from any context, including user context,
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9),
procedures,
.BR bufcall (9),
.BR qbufcall (9),
.BR timeout (9),
or
.BR qtimeout (9)
callback functions,
or interrupt service routines.
Note, however, that behaviour will be different when called from interrupt
service routines or from within the callback being cancelled.
See
.RI \(lq MP-STREAMS ",\(rq below."
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller of
.BR unbufcall ()
must ensure that the callback function has not returned from running before
calling
.BR unbufcall ().
.PP
Because the module is permitted to unload after calling
.BR unbufcall ()
for all outstanding buffer callbacks, the call to
.BR unbufcall ()
will not return until either the callback function has completed, or the
callback function has been cancelled.  Therefore the callback function will be
guaranteed not to run once 
.BR unbufcall ()
has returned for all outstanding callbacks
.I when called from the
.BR qclose (9)
.IR procedure .
When called from within the callback being cancelled, or at interrupt context
(having interrupted the callback on the same processor), the function will return
before the callback completes.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
can be called with a
.I bcid
returned by
.BR bufcall (9),
.BR esbbcall (9),
or
.BR qbufcall (9).
(For
.BR qbufcall (9),
it is more appropriate to use the
.BR qunbufcall (9)
function.)
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
must be called for all outstanding buffer calls from the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure of the module before exiting or unloading.
.PP
Because
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
uses object indices to
.B strevent
structures that expire once the callback function has run, when
.BR unbufcall ()
is called, it must be called promptly and should never be called after the callback function has
already completed.  Also, the callback function should remove all global references to
.I bcid
so that stale bufcall call handles do not exist in the system.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4spg
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR unbufcall ()
uses an efficient packed out-dating pointer for
.BR bcid_t .
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
uses rather inefficient linear lookups with interrupts disabled while looking for the
.I bcid
in the list of buffer callbacks.  As buffer callbacks should be rare in most
.I STREAMS
driver and module designs, this is of little moment.
.IP \(em
In
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4spg
.]
.BR unbufcall ()
was redefined to accept a
.B bcid_t
.I bcid
instead of an
.B int
.I bcid
as was the case for
.IR "SVR 3" .
.[
svr3spg
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
uses a
.B bufcall_id_t
instead.
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixdoc
.]
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
.[
uxpdoc
.]
use
.B register int
for
.IR bcid .
