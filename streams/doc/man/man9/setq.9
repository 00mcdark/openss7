.SH NAME
.B setq
\- set sizes and procedures associated with a \fISTREAMS\fP message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void setq(queue_t *" q ", struct qinit *" rinit ", struct qinit *" winit );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to set sizes and procedures.
.TP
.I rinit
a pointer to the
.BR qinit (9)
structure associated with the read side of the queue pair.
.TP
.I winit
a pointer to the
.BR qinit (9)
structure associated with the write side of the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR setq ()
sets the queue parameters for the read and write queues of the queue pair
indicated by the read queue pointer,
.IR q ,
to the read initialization information specified by
.IR rinit ,
and the write initialization informaiton specified by
.IR winit .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR setq ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR setq ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR setq ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR setq ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access
to the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR setq ()
is used internally by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler when creating a new queue pair for a driver or module to set the
parameters associated with each queue in the queue pair from the driver or
module
.BR streamtab .
It is also used by the
.I STREAMS
stream head when linking streams under a multiplexing driver to set the lower
multiplexer queue parameters against the stream head queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR qinit (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR setq ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBLITY
.PP
Symbol
.BR lis_setq ()
is provided for binary compatibility with LiS.  See
.BR lisbcm (9).
.BR lis_setq ()
simply calls
.BR setq ().
This function is not exported by SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI or
.IR Solaris \(rg.
