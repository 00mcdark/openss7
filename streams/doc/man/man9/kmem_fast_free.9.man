.SH NAME
.B kmem_fast_free
\- deallocates kernel memory
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/kmem.h>
.HP
.BI "void kmem_fast_free(caddr_t *" list ", caddr_t " ptr );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I list
a pointer to the free list pointer.
.TP
.I ptr
a pointer to the object to free.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Deallocates the memory previously allocated with
.BR kmem_fast_alloc (9)
or
.BR kmem_fast_zalloc (9).
.PP
As a side-effect of freeing memory allocated with
.BR kmem_fast_alloc (9)
or
.BR kmem_fast_zalloc (9),
.BR kmem_fast_free ()
also causes outstanding buffer calls to be scheduled.
.BR kmem_fast_free ()
checks the
.I strbcwait
system flag to see if there are buffer calls waiting.  If the
.I strbcwait
flag is set,
.BR kmem_fast_free ()
sets the
.I strbcalls
flag to tell the
.I STREAMS
scheduler to run buffer callbacks on the next run of
.BR runqueues (9)
and sets the
.I qrunflag
to indicate to the system that
.BR runqueues (9)
should be executed as soon as possible.
This is consistent with the procedure described for
.BR kmem_fast_free (9)
under
.IR "SVR 4" .

.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR kmem_fast_free ()
returns
.BR void .

.SH ERRORS

If
.BR kmem_fast_free ()
fails, it fails silently.

.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR kmem_fast_free ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR kmem_fast_free ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR kmem_fast_free ()
is implemented as a function that calls
.BR kmem_cache_free (9),
but which also performs the
.I STREAMS
scheduler related functions described above.
