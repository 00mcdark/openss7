.SH NAME
.B noenable
\- disables a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue from being scheduled
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void noenable(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to suppress scheduling.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR noenable ()
sets the
.B QNOENB
flag on the specified queue,
.IR q .
This tells the
.I STREAMS
scheduler that the queue not be scheduled for
.BR runqueues (9)
by calls to
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9)
when these function enqueue a normal priority message.
.BR noenable ()
has no effect on the scheduling of queue service procedures when the queue is
back-enabled,
when
.BR qenable (9)
is called explicitly, or when a priority message is enqueued with
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9).
.PP
.BR noenable ()
can be cancelled with
.BR enableok (9).
.PP
If
.BR noenable ()
has been called for a queue and
.BR enableok (9)
has not subsequently been called for the same queue, a second call to
.BR noenable ()
for the queue will have no effect.
.PP
Whether a queue has been disabled with a call to
.BR noenable ()
can be tested with
.BR canenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR noenable ()
can be used to temporarily suspend queue service procedure processing for a
queue for normal priority messages.  This permits data messages to be enqueued
with
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR appq (9)
or
.BR insq (9)
without invoking the queue's service procedure.
.PP
This facility can be used to provide Nagle-like algorithms for flow control on
read or write queues.  For example, multiple messages can be enqueued
permitting the queue's service procedure, when later invoked, to coalesce
smaller messages into larger ones.  Such a queue can be pushed by scheduling
the service procedure explicitly with the
.BR qenable (9)
call once a sufficient time period has elapsed, or once a sufficient number of
bytes have been enqueued.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR noenable ()
sets the
.B QNOENB
flag and returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR noenable ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR noenable ()
does not remove the queue from the current
.BR runqueues (9)
schedule list.  It only sets the
.B QNOENB
flag to indicate whether the queue should be subsequently scheduled.
To stop a queue from being scheduled, use
.BR qprocsoff (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR noenable ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR noenable ()
is MP-safe.
.BR noenable ()
uses atomic bit operations and does not write lock the queue.  Therefore,
.BR noenable ()
can be called for a queue that has been frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
No global locks need to be held across a call to
.BR noenable ()
and
.BR noenable ()
takes no locks.
.PP
If one thread disables a queue with
.BR noenable ()
and another enables the queue with
.BR enableok (9),
there will be a race condition on the
.B QNOENB
flag.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR noenable ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk

and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR noenable ()
uses atomic bit operations and does not require taking the queue write lock.
This makes
.BR noenable ()
safe for use on a write locked stream that has been frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.I LiS
takes the queue spin lock and uses normal bit operations to set the flag.
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()

.BR noenable ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
solspg
.]
permits
.BR noenable ()
to be called on a stream frozen with

.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not invoke
.BR noenable ()
on a stream that has previously been frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
called with an invalid
.I q
argument will have an undefined result.
In referenced versions of
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
the result is undefined in the same situations due to an
.I LiS
coding error.
Repaired versions of
.I LiS
will make
.BR noenable ()
fail silently in these situations.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not invoke
.BR noenable ()
with an invalid
.I q
argument.
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
only supresses the scheduling of queues for normal messages enqueued with
.BR appq (9).
Only
.I LiS
provides the
.BR appq (9)
function so the behaviour of
.BR noenable ()
with regard to
.BR appq (9)
is non-portable.
As with
.BR insq (9)
.I LiS
suppresses the scheduling of queues for any message enqueued with
.BR appq (9).
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not use the
.BR appq (9)
function call.
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules using the
.BR appq (9)
function call should not rely on the
.I LiS
behavior with regard to
.BR noenable ().
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
does not suppress the scheduling of queues when back-enabling is performed,
when
.BR qenable (9)
is explicitly called, or when priority messages are enqueued with
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR insq (9)
or
.BR appq (9).
.\".IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg

.IR UXP/V \(rg
state that
.BR noenable ()
disables the scheduling of queues resulting from a normal priority message
being placed on the queue with
.BR putq (9)

and that it disables scheduling of queues resulting from any message being
placed on the queue with

does not talk about

behaviour.
.\".IP \(em
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not rely upon the behaviour of
.BR insq (9)
with regard to high-priority messages when
.BR noenable ()
is in effect.
The best practice is to explicitly enable, using
.BR qenable (9),
the queue immediately after a high priority message is inserted into the queue with
.BR insq (9);
thus yeilding like behaviour across all these systems.

Symbol
.BR lis_safe_noenable ()

.BR lis_safe_noenable ()
