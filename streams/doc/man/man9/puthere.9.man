.SH NAME
.B puthere
\- invoke the put procedure for a \fISTREAMS\fP module or driver with a \fISTREAMS\fP message
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _OSF_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
int \fBputhere\fR(queue_t *\fIq\fR, mblk_t *\fImp\fR);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue to which to put the message.
.TP
.I mp
the message to put to the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR puthere ()
calls the
.I q->q_info->qi_putp
procedure associated with the passed in queue, with the arguments
.IR q " and " mp .
.PP
As a side-effect
.BR put ()
will wake up any processes waiting with
.BR qwait (9)
or
.BR qwait_sig (9)
on the specified queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR puthere ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR puthere ()
fails silently when a queue band structure cannot be allocated for the band
specified in
.IR mp->b_band .
The caller can ensure that a queue band structure exists for the band in
question by calling
.BR strqset (9)
for the band.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR puthere ()
can be called from any context; however,
if called from interrupt service routine context, calling of the queue's put
procedure will be deferred and run under soft interrupt context the next time
that the
.I STREAMS
soft interrupt is scheduled to run.
See also
.BR putnext (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR puthere ()
is MP-safe.  The driver or module put procedures invoke must also be MP-safe.
.PP
Under
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
any
.BR puthere ()
procedure could be executed concurrently with any queue
.BR put ()
.BR qopen (9),
.BR qclose (9),
.BR put (),
.BR srv (9)
procedure,
.BR esbbcall (9),
.BR bufcall (9),
.BR qbufcall (9),
.BR timeout (9),
.BR qtimeout (9)
callback function,
or interrupt service routine.
The
.BR put (9)
procedure itself must perform its own mutual exclusion.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR puthere ()
is a
.IR OSF/1 \(rg-specific
function:
.B _OSF_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_OSF
defined.

.BR puthere ()
is compatible with
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
with the following portability considerations:

.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR puthere ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs

differ from that of
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR puthere ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR puthere ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
