.SH NAME
.B M_ERROR
\- \fISTREAMS\fP error message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_ERROR
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_ERROR
message consists of one
.B M_ERROR
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sent upstream by modules or drivers to report some downstream error condition.  When the message
reaches the
.IR "Stream head" ,
the
.I Stream
is marked so that all subsequent system calls issued to the
.IR Stream ,
excluding
.BR close (2)
and
.BR poll (2),
will fail with
.BR errno (3)
set to the first data byte of the message.
.B POLLERR
is set if the
.I Stream
is being polled [see
.BR poll (2)].
All proceses sleeping on a system call to the
.I Stream
are awakened.  An
.BR M_FLUSH (9)
message with
.B FLUSHRW
is sent downstream.
.PP
The
.I Stream
maintains two error fields, one for the read-side and one for the write-side.  The one-byte format
.B M_ERROR
message sets both of these fields to the error specified by the first byte in the message.
.PP
The second style of the
.B M_ERROR
message is two bytes long.  The first byte is the read error and the second byte is the write error.
This allows modules to set a different error on the read-side and write-side.  If one of the bytes
is set to
.BR NOERROR ,
then the field for the corresponding side of the
.I Stream
is unchanged.  This allows a module to adjust an error on one side of the
.IR Stream .
For example, if the
.I Stream head
was not in an error state and a module sent an
.B M_ERROR
message upstream with the first byte set to
.RB [ EPROTO ]
and the second byte set to
.BR NOERROR ,
all subsequent real-like system calls (for example,
.BR write (2),
.BR putmsg (2))
will still succeed.  If a byte is set to
zero
.RB ( 0 ),
the error state is cleared for the corresponding side of the
.IR Stream .
The values of
.B NOERROR
and zero
.RB ( 0 )
are not valid for the one-byte form of the
.B M_ERROR
message.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_ERROR
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
