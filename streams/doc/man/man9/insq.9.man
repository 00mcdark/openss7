.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.I emp
the message before which to insert the message.
.TP

the message to insert.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR insq ()
inserts the message pointed to by
.I nmp
before the message pointed to by
.I emp
in the queue specified by
.IR q .
If the message pointer
.I emp
is
.B NULL
it indicates that the message pointed to by
.I nmp
is to be inserted at the end of the queue.
This means that
.BI insq( q ", NULL, " nmp )
is equivalent to
.BI putq( q ", " nmp ).
.PP
If a priority message is inserted into the queue, the queue will always be enabled, as with
.BR qenable (9);
that is, the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure will be scheduled if it exists.
.PP
If a normal message is inserted into an empty queue and the 
.B QWANTR
flag is set for the queue, then the queue will be enabled, as with
.BR enableq (9);
that is, the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure will be scheduled if it exists and the
.B QNOENB
flag has not been set for the queue with
.BR noenable (9).
.PP
If the insertion of either message into the queue causes the queue or queue band's count to exceed
the queue or queue band's high water mark, then the
.B QFULL
or
.B QB_FULL
bit will be set for the queue or queue band.
.\"
.\"
.SS Message Queueing Priority
.PP
.I STREAMS
queues messages based on message queueing priority.  There are three priority classes for messages:
.PP
.TS
tab(:);
lllsss.
1.:\fIHigh Priority\fP:(\fBdb_type >= QPCTL\fP)
2.:\fIPriority Band\fP:(\fBdb_type < QPCTL && b_band > 0\fP)
3.:\fINormal\fP:(\fBdb_type < QPCTL && b_band == 0\fP)
.TE
.PP
.I STREAMS
only examines the message class and priority band of the first message block of a message.  If a
.I High Priority
message is passed to
.BR insq ()
with a non-zero
.I b_band
value,
.I b_band
is reset to zero
.RB ( 0 )
before placing the message on the queue.  If the message is passed to
.BR insq ()
with
.I b_band
value greater than the number of
.BR qband (9)
structures associated with the queue,
.BR insq ()
attempts to allocate a new
.BR qband (9)
structure for each band up to and including the band of the message.
(But, see
.RI \(lq COMPATIBILTY \(rq,
below.)
.PP
Messages must be placed in order in the queue.  If the message is a
.I High Priority
message, it must be placed on the queue with other
.I High Priority
messages and ahead of
.I Priority Band
and
.I Normal
messages.  If the message is a
.I Priority Band
message, it must be placed with other messages in the queue
band.
If the message is a
.I Normal
message, it must be placed with other
.I Normal
messages, after all other messages.
Attempts to insert a message out of order in the queue with
.BR insq ()
will cause
.BR insq ()
to fail.
.PP
Placing the first message for a queue band onto the queue can result in the allocation of a
.BR qband (9)
structure to provide accounting for the queue band.  Failure to allocate a
.BR qband (9)
structure can cause
.BR insq ()
to fail.  Failure can be avoided by ensuring that a
.BR qband (9)
structure exists for the band,
.IR mp->b_band ,
using
.BR strqget (9)
or
.BR strqset (9).
.\"
.\"
.SS "Flow Control"
.PP
If a
.I High Priority
message is placed onto the queue, the queue will always be enabled, as with
.BR qenable (9);
that is, the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure will be scheduled if it exists.
This is true for
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (),
.BR putq (9),
and
.BR putbq (9).
Because this is true, a
.I High Priority
message should never be placed back on a queue by the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure with
.BR putbq (9),
otherwise and indefinite loop could result.
.PP
.BR insq ()
is allowed to enable the queue
.RB ( QNOENB
is not set) if the message is a
.I Priority Band
message, or the
.B QWANTR
flag is set indicating that the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure is ready to read the queue.
.PP
If a
.I Priority Band
message is placed onto an empty queue band, the queue will be enabled, as with
.BR enableq (9);
that is, the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure will be scheduled if it exists and the
.B QNOENB
flag has not been set for the queue with
.BR noenable (9).
.PP
If a
.I Normal
message is placed onto an empty queue and the
.B QWANTR
flag is set for the queue, then the queue will be enabled, as with
.BR enableq (9);
that is, the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure will be scheduled if it exists and the
.B QNOENB
flag has not been set for the queue with
.BR noenable (9).
Another way of putting this is that
.BR insq ()
will enable the queue if the queue is not inhibited with
.BR noenable (9)
and one of the following conditions also holds true:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
The module or driver has just been opened for the first time: that is, the queue is empty and has
always been empty.
.IP \(bu
.BR getq (9)
found no message queued on its last call and no message has been queued since.
.PP
When an ordinary message is enqueued by
.BR insq (),
it will cause the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure to be scheduled only if the queue was previously empty, and a previous
.BR getq (9)
call returns
.B NULL
(that is, the
.B QWANTR
flag is set).  If there are messages on the queue,
.BR insq ()
presumes that the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure is blocked by flow control and the procedure will be rescheduled by
.I STREAMS
when the block is removed.
.PP
As a general rule for
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (),
.BR putq (9),
and
.BR putbq (9),
the queue is enabled whenever the message placed on the message queue becomes the
first message on the queue, unless the message is a normal priority message and the queue has been
disabled with
.BR noenable (9),
or the message was placed with
.BR putbq (9).
.PP
.BR insq ()
only looks at the priority band of the first message block.  If a high priority message is passed to
.BR insq ()
with a non-zero
.I b_band
value,
.I b_band
is reset to zero
.RB ( 0 )
before placing the messge on the queue.  If the message is passed to
.BR insq ()
with a
.I b_band
value that is greater than the number of
.BR qband (9)
structures associated with the queue,
.BR insq ()
tries to allocate a new
.BR qband (9)
structure for each band up to and including the band of the message.
.PP
The above rules apply to
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (),
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9).
.PP
.BR insq ()
will not schedule a queue if
.BR noenable (9)
has been previously called for this queue.
.BR noenable ()
instructs
.BR insq ()
to enqueue the message when called by this queue, but not to schedule the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
.BR noenable (9)
doesnot prevent the queue from being scheduled by a flow control back-enable.  The inverse of
.BR noenable (9)
is
.BR enableok (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR insq ()
returns true (1) and the message pointed to by
.I nmp
has been inserted into the queue.
Upon failure,
.BR insq ()
returns false (0) and the message pointed to by
.I nmp
remains unaltered.  (See
.RI \*(lq COMPATIBILITY \*(rq,
below.)
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR insq ()
fails, it returns false (0).
.BR insq ()
can fail because the insertion creates a queue band and a queue band structure
could not be allocated.
It is possible to ensure that
.BR insq ()
does not fail by first establishing the queue band structure using
.BR strqset (9).
.BR insq ()
can also fail because the placement of the message would miss-order the queue with regard to the
priority of messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR insq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts, and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR insq ()
is MP-safe;
however, the caller must ensure validity of the
.I emp
argument.  The validity of
.I emp
can be guaranteed by freezing the Stream with
.BR freezestr (9)
before taking the
.I emp 
reference, and across the call to
.BR insq ().
Module private locks can also be used to accomplish the same purpose, so
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE_TITLE@
.]
does not require that the Stream be frozen by the caller.
.\".BR insq ()
.\"takes a write lock on the queue, so calling
.\".BR insq ()
.\"while the queue is frozen with
.\".BR freezestr (9)
.\"will result in single-party deadlock on some systems.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Some implementations of
.BR insq ()
ignore the queue class (whether the message is a high priority or normal message) when considering
ordering within the queue and some also when considering enabling of the queue (that is, for
enabling all messages are treated as normal messages).
Ignoring queue priority has some marginal performance advantages.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
does neither:
.BR insq ()
checks queue class when considering ordering within the queue, and it also checks queue class when
applying queue flow control rules.  For additional information on flow control and
.BR insq (),
see
.BR noenable (9).
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
uses recursive locks, so calling
.BR insq ()
while the queue is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
will never cause single-party deadlock.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
If the existing message pointer,
.IR emp ,
is
.BR NULL ,
.BR insq ()
simply executes
.BR putq (9).
If the existing message pointer,
.IR emp ,
is not
.BR NULL ,
then
.BR insq ()
checks to see that
.I emp
is indeed queued on the message queue,
.IR q ,
before proceeding.  Otherwise,
.BR insq ()
indicates failure and prints an error to the system logs.
Some other implementations will panic in this situation.

with

This practice might result in an extra scheduling of the queue under some circumstances, however, an
extra scheduling of the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure is more acceptable than the loss of enabling a
queue: the later can cause queue scheduling to postpone indefinitely.

.IP ""
Under older versions of
.IR LiS ,
failure (0) modifies the
.I nmp
message, freeing it with
.BR freemsg (9)
under some circumstances.  This is an
.I LiS
bug.  No passed in structures should
be modified on failure.
Current versions of
.I LiS

do not have this problem.
.IP \(em
Older versions of
.I LiS
incorrectly free the message pointed to by
.I nmp
when the call to
.BR insq ()
fails due to a
.B NULL
queue pointer
.IR q ,
or when the queue pointer
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure, or when the queue pointer
.I q
points to a queue that is closing or has processing turned off.
On the other hand, these versions of
.I LiS
do not free the message pointer pointed to by
.I nmp
when
.BR insq ()
fails because the insertion would mis-sequence the queue.  Because of this
bug, when
.BR insq ()
returns failure (0), it is difficult to determine whether the message
pointed to by
.I nmp
has been freed or not.
Current versions of

.BR insq ()
will insert messages into a queue that has had

called or which is closing

.IP ""
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR insq ()
will return failure (0) in these cases and older versions will also free the message pointed to by
.IR nmp .
(Current versions of
.I LiS

do not free the message.)
Regardless,
.I LiS
behaviour is incorrect for these cases.
.BR qprocsoff (9)
only affects the running of queue procedures and should not affect
.BR insq ().
.IR qi_qclose (9)
may need to exchange messages with lower level queue pairs and manipulate queues: making
.BR insq ()
return
.B NULL
during close is an
.I LiS
bug.
