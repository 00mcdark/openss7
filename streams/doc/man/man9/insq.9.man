.SH NAME
.B insq
\- inserts a message into a \fISTREAMS\fP message queue
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int insq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" emp ", mblk_t *" nmp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue into which to insert the message.
.PD 0
.TP
.I emp
the message before which to insert the message.
.TP
.I nmp
the message to insert.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR insq ()
inserts the message pointed to by
.I nmp
before the message pointed to by
.I emp
in the queue specified by
.IR q .
If the message pointer
.I emp
is
.B NULL
it indicates that the message pointed to by
.I nmp
is to be inserted at the end of the queue.
This means that
.BI insq( q ", NULL, " nmp )
is equivalent to
.BI putq( q ", " nmp ).
.PP
If a priority message is inserted into the queue, the queue will always be enabled, as with
.BR qenable (9);
that is, the queue's service procedure will be scheduled if it exists.
.PP
If a normal message is inserted into an empty queue and the 
.B QWANTR
flag is set for the queue, then the queue will be enabled, as with
.BR enableq (9);
that is, the queue's service procedure will be scheduled if it exists and the
.B QNOENB
flag has not been set for the queue with
.BR noenable (9).
.PP
If the insertion of either message into the queue causes the queue or queue band's count to exceed
the queue or queue band's high water mark, then the
.B QFULL
or
.B QB_FULL
bit will be set for the queue or queue band.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR insq ()
returns true (1) and the message pointed to by
.I nmp
has been inserted into the queue.
Upon failure,
.BR insq ()
returns false (0) and the message pointed to by
.I nmp
remains unaltered.  (See
.RI \*(lq COMPATIBILITY \*(rq,
below.)
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR insq ()
fails, it returns false (0).
.BR insq ()
can fail because the insertion creates a queue band and a queue band structure
could not be allocated.
It is possible to ensure that
.BR insq ()
does not fail by first establishing the queue band structure using
.BR strqset (9).
.BR insq ()
can also fail because the placement of the message would miss-order the queue with regard to the
priority of messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR insq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR insq ()
is MP-safe.
.BR insq ()
takes a write lock on the queue, so calling
.BR insq ()
while the queue is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
will result in single-party deadlock on some systems.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Some implementations of
.BR insq ()
ignore the queue class (whether the message is a high priority or normal message) when considering
ordering within the queue and some also when considering enabling of the queue (that is, for
enabling all messages are treated as normal messages).
Ignoring queue priority has some marginal performance advantages.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
does neither:
.BR insq ()
checks queue class when considering ordering within the queue, and it also checks queue class when
applying queue flow control rules.  For additional information on flow control and
.BR insq (),
see
.BR noenable (9).
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
uses recursive locks, so calling
.BR insq ()
while the queue is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
does not cause deadlock.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
If the existing message pointer,
.IR emp ,
is
.BR NULL ,
.BR insq ()
simply executes
.BR putq (9).
If the existing message pointer,
.IR emp ,
is not
.BR NULL ,
then
.BR insq ()
checks to see that
.I emp
is indeed queued on the message queue,
.IR q ,
before proceeding.  Otherwise,
.BR insq ()
indicates failure and prints an error to the system logs.
Some other implementations will panic in this situation.

Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will not insert high priority messages into queues.  If it is absolutely
necessary to insert a high priority message into a queue,
portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will not rely upon
.BR insq ()
to schedule a queue when a high priority message is inserted into the queue:
instead
.BR qenable (9)
will always be explicitly called after successfully inserting a high priority message into a queue
with
.BR insq ().
This practice might result in an extra scheduling of the queue under some circumstances, however, an
extra scheduling of the queue's service procedure is more acceptable than the loss of enabling a
queue: the later can cause queue scheduling to postpone indefinitely.
