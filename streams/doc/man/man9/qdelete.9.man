.TH QDELETE 9 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ DDI/DKI"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B qdelete
\- delete a queue pair from a Stream
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void qdelete(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue pair to delete.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qdelete ()
half-deletes the queue pair identified by
.I q
from the Stream to which it belongs.  The
.I q->q_next
pointers of the queue pair to be deleted,
.IR q ,
are adjusted, but the Stream remains unaffected.
.BR qprocsoff (9)
must be called before calling
.BR qdelete ()
to properly remove the queue pair from the Stream.
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is responsible for adjusting the
.I q_next
pointer of the Stream head write queue and the read queue at the top of the module stack or driver
to bypass the module.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR qdelete()
should only be called from the
.BR qattach (9)
or
.BR qdetach (9)
procedure or a Stream head
.BR stropen (9)
open or
.BR strclose (9)
close procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qdelete ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qdelete ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qdelete()
must only be called at process context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qdelete()
should only be called from the
.BR qattach (9)
or
.BR qdetach (9)
procedure or a Stream head
.BR stropen (9)
open or
.BR strclose (9)
close procedure.
.PP
.BR qdelete ()
takes a plumbing write lock on the Stream head before nulling the
.I q_next
pointers of the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The queue pair,
.IR q ,
should have been already removed from data flow in the Stream with
.BR qprocsoff (9)
(but checks again anyway).
.PP
.I q
must be a valid pointer or bad things will happen.
.PP
.BR qdelete ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function which was not intended to be called by
the
.I STREAMS
module or driver writer.
.BR qdelete ()
is not part of the DDI/DKI and should not be called by portable programs.
.BR qdelete ()
is highly implementation dependent in function and prototype.  Use of this
function by a driver or module will guarantee that it is not portable even between
releases of
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The functions does not do gets and puts on the Stream head when adding or removing queue pairs from
the Stream because the Stream head reference count falling to zero is used to deallocate thte Stream
head queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qdelete ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qdelete ()
is compatible with descriptions of
.I STREAMS
internals for
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
magic
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qdelete ()
is roughly compatible with the internal operations described for
.IR "SVR 4 STREAMS"
in
.RI \(lq "The Magic Garden Explained" \(rq.
.[
magic
.]
.IP ""
.BR qdelete ()
is an internal function that will not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers.
.IP \(em
.I SVR 4.2 MP
and systems based on
.I SVR 4
do not export this function.
.IP \(em
Source and Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
