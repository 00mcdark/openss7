.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B Strinfo
structure is a structure used internal to the
.I STREAMS
scheduler that is used to store information abotu allocated structures within the
.I STREAMS
executive.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.I STREAMS
kernel threads run at process context within the kernel.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
The
.B Strinfo
array is global to all CPUs and requires protection.
This is an internal scheduler structure and should not be manipulated directly.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B Strinfo
structures are not intended to be used directly by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.  It is only intended to be used directly by
.I STREAMS
utility and configuration drivers such as the
.BR sc (4)
module and
.BR sad (4)
driver.
.PP
Manipulating
.B Strinfo
structures without using
.I STREAMS
utility functions intended to do so, will likely cause panics and crash the system.  Use proper
.I STREAMS
utility functions instead.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B Strinfo
contains information that was allocated statically within the kernel in accordance with the
descriptions for
.IR "SVR 4"
.[

.]
in the MG.
.[
magic
.]
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The
.B Strinfo
structure is consistent with the description of internal static variables associated with the
.I STREAMS
scheduler function of
.IR "SVR 4" .
