.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR major ()
returns the major device number associated with
.IR dev .
.BR major ()
is the
.I SVR 3

name for the
.BR getmajor (9)
function of
.IR "SVR 4" .

.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR major ()
returns the major device number associated with
.IR dev .
.BR major ()
is the

function.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR major ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR major ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR major ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR major ()
is the
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
name for
.BR getmajor (9).
.BR major ()
was renamed to
.BR getmajor (9)
with the advent of the DDI/DKI in
.IR "SVR 4" .
.[
svr4
.]
.PP
.BR getmajor (9)
should be used in preference to
.BR major ().
.BR major ()
should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.PP
.BR major ()
is a
.IR "SVR 3" -specific
macro that is present in system header file
.BR <sys/sysmacros.h> .
.PP
.BR major ()
is a
.IR "SVR 3" -specific
function:
.B _SVR3_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR3
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR3_MODULE
defined.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR major (9)
is implemented with a call to
.BR MAJOR (9).

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR major ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 3"
.[
svr3
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 3" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR major ()
is implemented as an
.B extern inline
function.  Under
.IR "SVR 3" ,
.BR major ()
was implemented as an architecture dependent macro.
.IP \(em
.BR major ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 3"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 3"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 3"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR major ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 3"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR major ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
