.SH NAME
.B kmem_free
\- deallocates kernel memory
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/kmem.h>
.HP
.BI "void kmem_free(char *" ptr ", size_t " size );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I ptr
a pointer to the kernel memory area.
.TP
.I size
the size of the kernel memory area to free.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Deallocates the memory previously allocated with
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
or
.BR kmem_zalloc (9).
.PP
As a side-effect of freeing memory allocated with
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
or
.BR kmem_zalloc (9),
.BR kmem_free ()
also causes outstanding buffer calls to be scheduled.
.BR kmem_free ()
checks the
.I strbcwait
system flag to see if there are buffer calls waiting.  If the
.I strbcwait
flag is set,
.BR kmem_free ()
sets the
.I strbcalls
flag to tell the
.I STREAMS
scheduler to run buffer callbacks on the next run of
.BR runqueues (9)
and sets the
.I qrunflag
to indicate to the system that
.BR runqueues (9)
should be executed as soon as possible.
This is consistent with the procedure described for
.BR kmem_free (9)
under SVR 4.

.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
If
.BR kmem_free ()
fails, it fails silently.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
is implemented as a function that calls
.BR kfree (9),
but which also performs the
.I STREAMS
scheduler related functions described above.
.\"

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR kmem_alloc (9),
.BR kmem_zalloc (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI,
.IR Solaris \(rg
and LiS
.[
LiS
.]
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Under LiS,
.BR kmem_free ()
ignores the
.I size
argument and frees memory using
.BR lis_mfree()
which always calls
.BR kfree (9).
LiS does not properly schedule buffer calls in accordance with
SVR 4.2.
.IP \(em
.BR kmem_free ()
is implemented as a function call.  LiS implements
.BR kmem_free ()
as a macro.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

.BR STREAMS (9)
