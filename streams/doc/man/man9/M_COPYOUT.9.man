.SH NAME
.B M_COPYOUT
\- \fISTREAMS\fP copyout message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_COPYOUT
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_COPYOUT
message consists of one
.B M_COPYOUT
message block followed by one or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_COPYOUT
message is generated by a module or driver and sent upstream to request that the
.I Stream head
perform a
.BR copyout (9)
on behalf of the module or driver.  It is valid only after receiving an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message and before an
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
or
.BR M_IOCNAK (9).
.PP
The message format is one
.B M_COPYOUT
message block followed by one or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks.  The
.B M_COPYOUT
message block contains a
.BR copyreq (9)
structure as described in
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
with the following differences:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
The
.I cq_addr
field contains the user space address to which the data are to be copied.
.IP \(bu
The
.I cq_size
field is the number of bytes to copy to user space.
.PP
Data to be copied to user space is contained in the linked
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks.
.PP
The module or driver responding to a
.I tranparent
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message issues a
.B M_COPYOUT
message when it wishes to copy data out to the user.  The message is formulated and issued
upstream to the
.IR "Stream head" .
When reveived by the
.IR "Stream head" ,
the
.I "Stream head"
will attempt to copy out the requested amount of data of size
.IR cq_size ,
to the user address
.IR cq_addr ,
using the
.BR copyout (9)
utility.
.PP
If the
.BR copyout (9)
operation succeeds, the
.I Stream head
will reply with an
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message block whose
.I cp_rval
member is set to
.BR "(caddr_t)(0)" ,
indicating that the operation was successful.
.PP
If the
.BR copyout (9)
operation fails, the
.I Stream head
will reply with an
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message block whose
.I cp_rval
member is set to
.BR "(caddr_t)(1)" ,
to indicate the error, and then aborts the
.BR ioctl (2)
operation and returns
.RB [ EFAULT ]
to the user in
.IR errno (3).
This provides the module or driver with the opportunity to clean up the
.I cq_private
pointer when the
.BR ioctl (2)
operation is aborted.
.PP
See
.BR M_IOCDATA (9),
for more information.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
This message should not be queued by a module or driver unless it intends to process the data for
the
.BR ioctl (2)
in some way.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_COPYOUT
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:

.B LiS

erroneously expects an
.BR M_IOCNAK (9)
message containing an error when it responds to the driver with an
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message with a
.I cp_rval
of
.BR "(caddr_t)(1)" .
See
.BR M_IOCDATA (9),
for more information.

Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will use
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@

Binary compatiblity is not guaranteed.
