.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I dev
the device number to convert to an external major.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR getemajor ()
gets the external device major number associated with the extern
.B dev_t
device number,
.IR dev .
.BR getemajor ()
is a UWDDI specific function intended to replace
.BR getmajor (9).
Both are a system independent way for a
.I STREAMS
driver or module to obtain the external major device number from the external
device number; however,
.BR getemajor (9)
is often implemented as an architecture dependent macro, whereas
.BR getmajor ()
is an architecture independent function call.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR getemajor ()
returns the external major device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR getemajor ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR getemajor ()
uses
.BR MAJOR (9)
to obtain the external major device number.

.SH BUGS

has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR getemajor ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR UnixWare \(rg
drivers to
.IR Linux \(rg.
Because the
.BR dev_t
structure for
.IR Linux \(rg
differs from that of
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
