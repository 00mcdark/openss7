.SH NAME
.B streams_schedule
\- schedule a process, leaving sychronization barriers while sleeping
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR "STREAMS" ,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strsubr.h>
.HP
.B void streams_schedule(void);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR streams_schedule ()
is identical to the
.B Linux
.BR schedule ()
function, with the exception that
.BR streams_schedule ()
exits any inner or outer
.I STREAMS
MP syncrhonization barriers that the process has entered before scheduling.
After execution resumes, but before returning from the
.BR streams_schedule ()
call, any barriers that the process had entered before the call are reentered.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR streams_schedule ()
is used in place of
.BR schedule ()
in a
.I STREAMS
module's open or close procedure,
.IR qi_qopen "(9) or " qi_qclose (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR streams_schedule ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR streams_schedule ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR streams_schedule ()
can be called from any blocking context.  If the calling process is not within
any
.I STREAMS
syncrhonization barriers, the call operates identically to
.BR schedule ().
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR streams_schedule ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
This function is used for implementing the
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
solspg
.]
compatible
.BR qwait "(9) and " qwait_sig (9)
utilities, as well as the
.IR "SVR 4.2" \(rg
.[
svr42spg
.]
compatible
.BR SV_WAIT "(9) and " SV_WAIT_SIG (9)
utilities.

.BR streams_schedule ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR streams_schedule ()
is compatible with the
