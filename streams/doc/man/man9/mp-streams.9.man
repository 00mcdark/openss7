This manual page provides additional information with regards to synchronization
and serialization of events within the
.I STREAMS
executive, for compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
.[
svr42
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4 MP" .
.[

with the
.IR Solaris \(rg
implementation of
.IR STREAMS .
.[
solspg

.SS Configuration
.PP
Synchronization is specified by the module writer during configuration of a
.I STREAMS
module.
This is accomplished using flags and synchronization level definitions to the
module installation or registration function.  For compatibility with other
registration mechanisms based on
.I SVR 4 MP
.IR STREAMS ,
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides the following flags and synchronization levels:
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B Synchronization Flags
.TP
.B D_MP
Specifies that the module is MP-safe and observes a synchronization model
specified by the following flags.
The queue
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures, as well as asynchronous callbacks and call-outs of all kinds
can run concurrent, particularly in a multiprocessor environment.
Modules that set this flag must normally perform their own mutual exclusion or
critical section protections, and all procedures must be fully MP-safe.
.IP ""
Modules that do not specify
.B D_MP
are not MP-safe and will be run by default with synchronization at the module
level (single threaded).
.TP
.B D_MTPERQ
Specifies that the module has an inner perimeter and that synchronization at the
inner perimeter is per queue.  This is the same as the synchronization level
.BR SQLVL_QUEUE ,
below.
Only one
.I STREAMS
executive thread per queue will be permitted.  Other threads will wait until
a thread currently within the perimeter exits.
.IP ""
Normally in
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" ,
only one thread will execute a queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure at a given time.  However, normally queue
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedures, as well as all asynchronous callbacks, can run concurrent with the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
This inner perimeter causes
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures to be run exclusive with
.IR qi_putp (9)
(unless
.B D_MTPUTSHARED
is also set), as well as exclusive with all synchronous callbacks.
.TP
.B D_MTQPAIR
Specifies that the module has an inner perimeter and that synchronization at
the inner perimeter is per queue pair.  This is the same as the
synchronization level
.BR SQLVL_QUEUEPAIR ,
below.
Only one
.I STREAMS
executive thread per queue pair will be permitted.  Other threads will wait
until a thread currently within the perimeter exits.
.TP
.B D_MTPERMOD
Specifies that the module has an inner perimeter and that synchronization at
the inner perimeter is per module.  This is the same as the synchronization
level
.BR SQLVL_MODULE ,
below.
Only one
.I STREAMS
executive thread per module will be permitted.  Other threads will wait until
a thread currently within the perimeter exits.
.TP
.B D_MTPUTSHARED
Specifies that the
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure will be permitted to enter the inner perimeter shared.  This means
that module
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedures must run fully re-entrant and multi-threaded.  Also, that
calling sequence of
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedures is not guaranteed by the
.I STREAMS
executive.
.TP
.B D_MTOUTPERIM
Specifies that an outer perimeter exists enclosing the module.  Threads at the
outer perimeter will be allowed to enter the module shared.
.TP
.B D_MTOCEXCL
Specifies that the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures will be run exclusive at the outer perimeter.  That is,
.IR qi_qopen (9)
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures will run single-threaded.
This flag is useful where the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures of a module use data structures that are global to the module.
This is a
.IR Solaris \(rg
specific concept.
.[
solspg
.]
Other multi-processor
.I STREAMS
executives provide some utility functions that ensure that common data
structures are protected.  For example:
.BR mi_comm_open (9),
.BR mi_comm_close (9),
.BR streams_open (9),
.BR streams_close (9),
or even
.IR Solaris \(rg's
own
.BR ddi_get_soft_state (9)
mechanism.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B Configuration Flags
.TP
.B STR_MPSAFE
Same as the
.B D_MP
flag, above.
.TP
.B STR_QSAFETY
Specifies that interrupt-safe callbacks are required.
.TP
.B STR_PERSTREAM
Specifies that the module agrees to per-Stream synchronization for non MP-safe
modules.
.TP
.B STR_Q_NOTTOSPEC
Specifies that the module is not to specification and runs under a process
context.  The module might sleep in its procedures.
.PP
Normally when modules are not MP-safe, the default is to use per-module synchronization for the
module (see
.B SQLVL_DEFAULT
below).  This means that only one thread is permitted into the entire module.  That is rather
restrictive and can cause difficulties when MP-safe modules are in the Stream.  (MP-safe modules
will run more aggressive and are likely to out-pace per-module synchronized modules, impairing the
performance of all Streams in which the module is included.)
.PP
Another solution is to run each of the non-MP-safe module's Streams at per-Stream synchronization,
where only a single thread is permitted per Stream, but multiple threads are permitted per module.
Unfortunately, other MP-safe modules in the Stream must be prepared to accept this situation, as
they may be relying on a different synchronization model within their modules.  Setting the
.B STR_PERSTREAM
flag for a module or driver indicates that, regardless of whether the module or driver is MP-safe or
not, that it accepts being run in per-Stream synchronization when a non-MP-safe module or driver is
in the same Stream.  As a Stream is built up and includes a non-MP-safe module, if all of the
modules and driver on the Stream have the
.B STR_PERSTREAM
flag set, then the Stream will be run with per-Stream synchronization.  If any module or driver on
the Stream does not have the
.B STR_PERSTREAM
flag set, the all non-MP-safe modules on the Stream (and any of their instances in other Streams)
will be forced to run in per-module synchronization.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B Synchronization Levels
.TP
.B SQLVL_NOP
Specifies that the module is run without synchronization.  All synchronous
module entry points, call-outs and callbacks become asynchronous.  It is the
module's responsibility to provide synchronization or serialization as
required.
.TP
.B SQLVL_QUEUE
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization at the queue.  Only one
thread will be permitted to enter a given queue's procedures, however, another
thread will be permitted to enter the procedures of the other queue in the
queue pair.
This is useful when the read and write side of a module are largely
independent and do not require synchronization between sides of the queue
pair.
This level is equivalent to the
.B D_MTPERQ
flag, above.
.TP
.B SQLVL_QUEUEPAIR
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization at the queue pair.
Only one thread will be permitted to enter a given queue's procedures within a
given queue pair.  Where the read and write side of the queue pair shared the
same private structure (q->q_ptr), this provides MP protection of the common
data structure to all synchronous entry points.
This level is equivalent to the
.B D_MTQPAIR
flag, above.
.TP
.B SQLVL_DEFAULT
Specifies that the module uses the default synchronization scheme.  This is
the same a specifying
.BR SQLVL_MODULE .
.TP
.B SQLVL_MODULE
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization at the module.  Only one
thread of execution will be permitted within the module.  Where the module
does not share data structures between modules, this has a similar effect to
running on a UP system.
This is the default and works best for non-MP-safe modules written in
accordances with
.I STREAMS
guidelines.
This level is equivalent to the
.B D_MTPERMOD
flag, above.
.TP
.B SQLVL_ELSEWHERE
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization within a group of
modules.  Only one thread of execution will be within the group of modules at
a time.  The group is separately specified as a character string name.  This
permits a group of modules to run single threaded as though they are running
on a single processor, without interfering with the concurrency of other
module outside the group.  This can be important for testing and for modules
that implicitly share unprotected data structures.
.TP
.B SQLVL_GLOBAL
Specifies that the module is run with global synchronization.  This means that
only one
.I STREAMS
executive thread will be permitted to enter any synchronous module.  This makes
the entire
.I STREAMS
executive single threaded and is useful primarily for debugging.  This is the
same as
.I "\*(lqUniprocessor Emulation\*(rq"
on some systems, and reduces the
.I STREAMS
executive to running on a single processor at a time.  On multiprocessor
systems, the
.I STREAMS
executive will still run on multiple processors, it is just that it will be
running on only one of those processors at a given point in time.

flag is set during configuration, asynchronous callback function invoked from
within the

addition, local interrupts will be suppressed on the servicing processor.

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
The following contexts are of interest:
.TP
.B STREAMS Synchronous
Running under
.I STREAMS
and synchronized against the target queue.  A Stream head plumbing lock is held in the Stream to
which the queue belongs, or the
.B STRWOPEN
bit is held.
.IP ""
This is the case when the Stream is frozen, or when executing a queue put or service procedure, open
or close call-out, or a synchronous callback for the target queue.
.I q_next
pointers can be dereferenced for any queue in the Stream without being invalidated.
.TP
.B STREAMS Asynchronous
Running under
.I STREAMS
but not synchronized against the target queue.
.IP ""
This is the case when executing a synchronous procedure, call-out or callback, for a queue in one
Stream and referencing a queue in another Stream.  It is also the case when an asynchronous callback
(one not referenced on a queue) is being executed.
.IP ""
Under the special case when running under
.I STREAMS
where the target queue belongs to a Stream linked to a lower multiplex, the context can be
considered as synchronous if the caller can suppress concurrent unlinking of the Stream.  This can
normally be performed with private locks taken within a put or service procedure of a multiplexing
driver.  But this is complex and best avoided by treating all such queues as asynchronous.
.TP
.B Non-STREAMS Asynchronous
Not running under
.I STREAMS
and not synchronized against the target queue.
.IP ""
This is the case when calling any utility from outside of
.IR STREAMS .
This can be from process context, software interrupt, bottom-halves, tasklets,
.B Linux
timeouts, interrupt service routines, etc.
.IP ""
.RI Non- STREAMS
asynchronous contexts can be synchronized against a queue with
.BR freezestr (9),
.BR qwriter (9),
.BR streams_put (9),
.PP
In a synchronous context, all
.I q_next
pointer dereferences for any queue in the Stream to which the synchronization queue belongs is
valid for the duration of the context.
In an asynchronous context, no assurances of the validity of
.I q_next
dereferences can be made.   This is of primary concern to
.I STREAMS
utilities that dereference a
.I q_next
pointer.
As discussed briefly above, lower multiplex Streams are of less concern that upper multiplex Streams
(that could be closed or have modules pushed or popped at any time).
.PP
When in a synchronous context with respect to a queue, a plumbing read lock is held for the Stream
head of the Stream to which the queue belongs.  Utilities that deference
.I q_next
without first taking a Stream head plumbing read lock can only be called in a synchronous context.
Utilities that acquire a Stream head plumbing read lock before dereferencing
.I q_next
can be called from any context, but would be wasteful and scale poorly if normally called from
synchronous context.
Utilities that do not dereference
.I q_next
and only affect the queue itself, take a queue write lock and can be called from any
context.
.PP
.B Validity/Exclusion for q
.PP
All
.I STREAMS
utilities that accept a queue pointer require validity of the queue pointer across the call, but not
exclusion: exclusion is accomplished within the utility with locks.
.PP
When in the synchronous context, any queue in the Stream can be passed to a utility function and it
is guaranteed valid.  However, in the asynchronous context, the caller is responsible for ensuring
the validity of the passed in queue pointer.  A pointer to a queue remains valid from the point that
the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine for a queue pair is entered, until just before the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine for the queue pair is exited.
Therefore, references to a queue that are acquired in the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine and released in the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine are guaranteed valid.
.PP
For example, an interrupt service routine that is established and passed a read queue pointer on
.IR qi_qopen (9)
for the queue pair, and if the ISR is disabled in the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
for the queue pair, releasing the read queue pointer,
then the read queue pointer is valid to be used in any
.I STREAMS
utility called during the ISR.
.PP
Pointers to queues in a Stream that is linked to a lower multiplex are guaranteed valid while the
Stream remains linked (the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine cannot be called until it is unlinked).  This is also true for
.I q_next
pointers, in that modules cannot be pushed or popped from a Stream linked to a lower multiplex until
it is unlinked.
Therefore, if a multiplexing driver can guarantee, by acquiring a private lock, that no Stream will
be unlinked until the lock is released, a pointer to any queue in any lower multiplex Stream will be
guaranteed valid, and the context can be considered synchronous for any Stream on the lower
multiplex.
Pointers to queues in an upper multiplex cannot be guaranteed in this way (because modules can be
pushed or popped from an asynchronous Stream at any time).
.PP
.I STREAMS
utilities that require exclusive access to the referenced queue, take their own write locks on the
queue.  Therefore, the caller does not have to ensure exclusion on the
.BR queue (9)
structure or any attached [e.g.,
.BR qband (9)]
structures.
.PP
.B Validity/Exclusion for mp
.PP
All
.I STREAMS
utilities that accept a message pointer require both validity of the message pointer across the
call, exclusion on the message block across the call, and exclusion on the data block or buffer of
the message altered by the utility across the call.
.PP
When in a synchronous context and the message has been passed to the queue's put procedure, removed
from the the queue by its service procedure, or freshly allocated (regardless of context), the
message pointer is guaranteed valid until passed to another put procedure.
.PP
Whenever a dereference of a message pointer is valid, the holder of the dereference has exclusive
access to the
.BR msgb (9)
message block structure.
If the
.BR datab (9)
data block structure has a reference count
.I db_ref
of one, the holder also has exclusive access to the data block.  If the holder has exclusive access
to the data block and there is no extended buffer attached to the data block (i.e., it was allocated
with
.BR allocb (9)
and not
.BR esballoc (9),
the holder also has exclusive access to the data buffer.
When
.I db_ref
is greater than 1, the easiest way to obtain exclusion from the data block and data buffer is to
copy the data block using utilities such as
.BR copyb (9)
or
.BR copymsg (9).

.SS Plumbing
.PP
Most plumbing operations performed on a Stream are performed from user process context (i.e., in
response to a system call).
One exception is
.BR welq (9)
and
.BR unweldq (9)
if they were to be called from a
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure instead of a
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine.
.PP
Plumbing operations include
.BR open (2s),
.BR close (2s),
.BR I_POP (7),
.BR I_PUSH (7),
.BR weldq (9),
.BR unweldq (9).
So, generally, any operation that invokes
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
to create or destroy the queue pair instance of a module or driver in a Stream, plus any welding of
Streams.
.BR I_LINK (7),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
.BR I_PLINK (7),
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
are not plumbing operations in the sense that they do not alter
.I q_next
pointers.
.PP
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE_TITLE@
.]
provides a specialized plumbing reader-writer lock in the Stream head to protect the
.I q_next
pointers (i.e., the plumbing) in a Stream.  When the plumbing reader-writer lock is acquired for
read, any
.I q_next
pointer in the entire Stream can be dereferenced and the dereference will remain valid until the
lock is released.
The reader-writer lock is acquired for write by any plumbing operation, as was described above.
.PP
All queue procedures, call-outs, and synchronous callbacks associated are synchronized against a
queue that belongs to a Stream which has a Stream head.  Before the synchronous procedure, call-out
or callback is invoked, the
.I STREAMS
scheduler thread acquires the Stream head (associated with the synchronizing queue) plumbing
reader-writer lock for read.  This means that any queue procedure, call-out, and callback,
synchronized on a queue, can dereference any
.I q_next
pointer within the Stream to which the synchronizing queue belongs, without any special treatment.
These procedures, call-outs and callbacks can use
.I STREAMS
utilities that require
.BR in_streams (9)
context.
.\"
.\"
.SS Freezing
.PP
In the Uni-Processor (UP) environment, it was sufficient to raise the system priority level
to ensure that no other queue procedures or thread were accessing the
Stream.
This was performed with
.BR splstr (9)
and
.BR splx (9).
.PP
In the Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) environment, it is also necessary to hold a lock to block
other processors from entering the critical section.
This is achieved by freezing the
Stream
with
.BR freezestr (9)
and thawing it with
.BR unfreezestr (9).
.RS
.ll -7n
.PP
.B Note:
when
.BR freezestr (9)
is called in a Uni-Processor (UP) environment, it is equivalent to
.BR splstr (9);
.BR unfreezestr (9),
.BR splx (9).
.ll +7n
.RE
.PP
Freezing a Stream results in local interrupts being suppressed and the Stream head reader-writer
freeze lock being held for write.  The Stream head reader-writer plumbing lock is also acquired for
read.  Thawing a Stream releases the read and write locks and restores local interrupts.
.PP
The Stream head plumbing reader-writer lock is acquired for write by any plumbing operation on the
Stream that would change
.I q_next
pointers on either queue pair.
Holding the Stream head plumbing read lock blocks any plumbing changes to the Stream.
.PP
The Stream head freeze reader-writer lock is acquired for read by any thread other than
the freezing thread entering a queue procedure
.RI [ qi_putp "(9) or " qi_srvp (9)].
After being acquired, the read lock is immediately released.  This stops any queue procedure from
being entered after the Stream is frozen by any thread other than the thread that froze the Stream,
but allows threads already executing in a queue procedure to proceed.  This is in accordance with
the descriptions for
.BR freezestr (9).
.\"
.\"
.SS Queue Pointers
.PP
In the Uni-Processor (UP) environment, calling
.BR splstr (9)
is sufficient to ensure that a valid queue pointer
.I q
will not invalidate across a call to any function until
.BR splx (9)
was called.  This is not the case in the Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) environment.
.PP
In the SMP environment, another processor may be executing
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures, or synchronous callbacks, concurrent with
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures.
Utilities called from the
.RI non- STREAMS
context (process context, asynchronous callbacks, soft interrupts, and interrupt service routines)
can execute concurrent with any procedures within the
.I STREAMS
environment
.RI ( qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9),
.IR qi_srvp (9),
synchronous callbacks, buffer free routines).
.IR qi_qopen (9)
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures, in particular, can cause
.I q_next
pointers to change, and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures can also result in the deallocation of queues.
The only
.I STREAMS
utilities that are provided that permit blocking of plumbing changes to the
Stream
are
.BR freezestr "(9), " unfreezestr (9)
and
.BR MPSTR_STPLOCK "(9), " MPSTR_STPRELE (9).

.\"
.\"
.SS Message Pointers
.PP
In both the UP and SMP environments, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure exclusive
access to any message pointer
.I mp
passed to any message handling or queue handing function.  Exclusive access does not have to be
ensured to the data blocks associated with the messages, and in particular the
.I db_ref
member.
.\"
.\"
.SS Locking
.PP
Following is a discussion of the locking used in
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" :
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
performs reference counting on all
.I STREAMS
objects.  Reference counting ensures that objects are not destroyed until the last reference to them
is released.  This means that no reference will be invalidated while it is still being used.  There
are several primary
.I STREAMS
object upon which most other references depend:
the driver,
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure;
the module
.BR fmodsw (9)
structure;
the Stream head,
.BR stdata (9)
structure; the queue,
.BR queue (9)
structure;
the synchronization queue,
.BR syncq (9)
structure.
.PP
Of these, the most delicate and complicated references are the reference to the Stream head,
.BR stdata (9)
structure from the
.B inode
and
.B file
pointer.
.PP
To protect the reference to a Stream head,
.BR stdata (9)
structure, from the
.BR inode ,
the
.B inode
.I i_sem
semaphore
is acquired before referencing from, or invalidating the reference to, the Stream head.
This is also true for the
.B file
pointer
.IR private_data :
we hold the
.B inode
.I i_sem
semaphore
while acquiring a reference to the Stream head via the
.B file
pointer, and also hold the
semaphore
while clearing the
.I private_data
pointer.
(This means a fair amount of
semaphore
taking and releasing when performing system calls.
In newer kernels the
.B inode
.I i_lock
spinlock can use used instead of the semaphore to reduce the locking overheads.)
.PP
The Stream head has associated with it a queue pair.  While the Stream head reference is valid,
there always exists a Stream head queue pair.
