when run on symmetrical multi-processor systems, and when compiled with kernel
configuration symbol
.B CONFIG_SMP
defined on symmetrical multi-processor (MP) or uniprocessor (UP), will execute
in
.B MP-STREAMS
mode.
.PP
This manpage provides additional information with regards to synchronization
and serialization of events within the
.I STREAMS
executive, for compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
.[
svr42
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4 MP" .
.[
svr4
.]
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
also provide a synchronization framework based on perimeters for compatibility
with the
.IR Solaris \(rg
implementation of
.IR STREAMS .
.[
solspg
.]
.SS Configuration
.PP
Synchronization is specified by the module writer during configuration of a
.I STREAMS
module.
This is accomplished using flags and synchronization level definitions to the
module installation or registration function.  For compatibility with other
registration mechanisms based on
.I SVR 4 MP
.IR STREAMS ,
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides the following flags and synchronization levels:
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B Synchronization Flags
.TP
.B D_MP
Specifies that the module is MP-safe and observes a synchronization model
specified by the following flags.
The queue
.BR qopen (9),
.BR qclose (9),
.BR put (9)
and
service procedures, as well as asynchronous callbacks and callouts of all kinds
can run concurrent, particularly in a multiprocessor environment.
Modules that set this flag must normally perform their own mutual exclusion or
critical section protections, and all procedures must be fully MP-safe.
.IP ""
Modules that do not specify
.B D_MP
are not MP-safe and will be run by default with synchronization at the module
level (single threaded).
.TP
.B D_MTPERQ
Specifies that the module has an inner perimeter and that synchronization at the
inner perimeter is per queue.  This is the same as the synchronization level
.BR SQLVL_QUEUE ,
below.
Only one
.I STREAMS
executive thread per queue will be permitted.  Other threads will wait until
a thread currently within the perimeter exits.
.IP ""
Normally in
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" ,
only one thread will execute a queue's service procedure at a given time.  However, normally queue
.BR put (9)
procedures, as well as all asynchronous callbacks, can run concurrent with the service procedure.
This inner perimeter causes service procedures to be run exclusive with
.BR put (9)
(unless
.B D_MTPUTSHARED
is also set), as well as exclusive with all syncrhonous callbacks.
.TP
.B D_MTQPAIR
Specifies that the module has an inner perimeter and that synchronization at
the inner perimeter is per queue pair.  This is the same as the
synchronization level
.BR SQLVL_QUEUEPAIR ,
below.
Only one
.I STREAMS
executive thread per queue pair will be permitted.  Other threads will wait
until a thread currently within the perimeter exits.
.TP
.B D_MTPERMOD
Specifies that the module has an inner perimeter and that synchronization at
the inner perimeter is per module.  This is the same as the synchronization
level
.BR SQLVL_MODULE ,
below.
Only one
.I STREAMS
executive thread per module will be permitted.  Other threads will wait until
a thread currently within the perimeter exits.
.TP
.B D_MTPUTSHARED
Specifies that the
.BR put (9)
procedure will be permitted to enter the inner perimeter shared.  This means
that module
.BR put (9)
procedures must run fully re-entrant and multi-threaded.  Also, that
calling sequence of
.BR put (9)
procedures is not guaranteed by the
.I STREAMS
executive.
.TP
.B D_MTOUTPERIM
Specifies that an outer perimeter exists enclosing the module.  Threads at the
outer perimeter will be allowed to enter the module shared.
.TP
.B D_MTOCEXCL
Specifies that the
.BR qopen (9)
and
.BR qclose (9)
procedures will be run exclusive at the outer perimeter.  That is,
.BR qopen (9)
and
.BR qclose (9)
procedures will run single-threaded.
This flag is useful where the
.BR qopen (9)
or
.BR qclose (9)
procedures of a module use data structures that are global to the module.
This is a
.IR Solaris \(rg
specific concept.
.[
solspg
.]
Other multi-processor
.I STREAMS
executives provide some utility functions that ensure that common data
structures are protected.  For example:
.BR mi_comm_open (9),
.BR mi_comm_close (9),
.BR streams_open (9),
.BR streams_close (9),
or even
.IR Solaris \(rg's
own
.BR ddi_get_soft_state (9)
mechanism.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B Configuration Flags
.TP
.B STR_MPSAFE
Same as the
.B D_MP
flag, above.
.TP
.B STR_QSAFETY
Specifies that interrupt-safe callbacks are required.
.TP
.B STR_PERSTREAM
Specifies that the module agrees to per-stream synchronization for non MP-safe
modules.
.TP
.B STR_Q_NOTTOSPEC
Specifies that the module is not to specification and runs under a process
context.  The module might sleep in its procedures.
.PP
Normally when modules are not MP-safe, the default is to use per-module sychronization for the
module (see
.B SQLVL_DEFAULT
below).  This means that only one thread is permitted into the entire module.  That is rather
restrictive and can cause difficulties when MP-safe modules are in the stream.  (MP-safe modules
will run more agressively and are likely to outpace per-module synchronized modules, impairing the
performance of all streams in which the module is included.)
.PP
Another solution is to run each of the non-MP-safe module's streams at per-stream syncrhonization,
where only a single thread is permitted per stream, but multiple threads are permitted per module.
Unfortunately, other MP-safe modules in the stream must be prepared to accept this situation, as
they may be relying on a different synchronization model within their modules.  Setting the
.B STR_PERSTREAM
flag for a module or driver indicates that, regardless of whether the module or driver is MP-safe or
not, that it accepts being run in per-stream syncrhonization when a non-MP-safe module or driver is
in the same stream.  As a stream is built up and includes a non-MP-safe module, if all of the
modules and driver on the stream have the
.B STR_PERSTREAM
flag set, then the stream will be run with per-stream synchronization.  If any module or driver on
the stream does not have the
.B STR_PERSTREAM
flag set, the all non-MP-safe modules on the stream (and any of their instances in other streams)
will be forced to run in per-module synchronization.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B Synchronization Levels
.TP
.B SQLVL_NOP
Specifies that the module is run without synchronization.  All synchronous
module entry points, call-outs and callbacks become asynchronous.  It is the
module's responsibility to provide synchronization or serialization as
required.
.TP
.B SQLVL_QUEUE
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization at the queue.  Only one
thread will be permitted to enter a given queue's procedures, however, another
thread will be permitted to enter the procedures of the other queue in the
queue pair.
This is useful when the read and write side of a module are largely
independent and do not require synchronization between sides of the queue
pair.
This level is equivalent to the
.B D_MTPERQ
flag, above.
.TP
.B SQLVL_QUEUEPAIR
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization at the queue pair.
Only one thread will be permitted to enter a given queue's procedures within a
given queue pair.  Where the read and write side of the queue pair shared the
same private structure (q->q_ptr), this provides MP protection of the common
data structure to all synchronous entry points.
This level is equivalent to the
.B D_MTQPAIR
flag, above.
.TP
.B SQLVL_DEFAULT
Specifies that the module uses the default synchronization scheme.  This is
the same a specifying
.BR SQLVL_MODULE .
.TP
.B SQLVL_MODULE
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization at the module.  Only one
thread of execution will be permitted within the module.  Where the module
does not share data structures between modules, this has a similar effect to
running on a UP system.
This is the default and works best for non-MP-safe modules written in
accordances with
.I STREAMS
guidelines.
This level is equivalent to the
.B D_MTPERMOD
flag, above.
.TP
.B SQLVL_ELSEWHERE
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization within a group of
modules.  Only one thread of execution will be within the group of modules at
a time.  The group is separately specified as a character string name.  This
permits a group of modules to run single threaded as though they are running
on a single processor, without interfering with the concurrency of other
module outside the group.  This can be important for testing and for modules
that implicitly share unprotected data structures.
.TP
.B SQLVL_GLOBAL
Specifies that the module is run with global synchronization.  This means that
only one
.I STREAMS
executive thread will be permitted to enter any syncrhonous module.  This makes
the entire
.I STREAMS
executive single threaded and is useful primarily for debugging.  This is the
same as
.I "\*(lqUniprocessor Emulation\*(rq"
on some systems, and reduces the
.I STREAMS
executive to running on a single processor at a time.  On multiprocessor
systems, the
.I STREAMS
executive will still run on multiple processors, it is just that it will be
running on only one of those processors at a given point in time.

.SS "Asynchronous Callbacks"

Asynchronous callback functions are not normally synchronized.
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides the following assurances with regard to asynchronous callbacks:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The callback function will be invoked on the processor that initiated the
callback.  This ensures that the callback function will not execute until
after the function that invoked the callback returns or encounters a
preemption point.
.IP \(em
If the
.B STR_QSAFETY
flag is set during configuration, asynchronous callback function invoked from
within the
.I STREAMS
executive (within a
.I STREAMS
queue procedure, call-out or callback function),
will be synchronized with the queue for which the callback is associated.  In
addition, local interrupts will be suppressed on the servicing processor.
.IP \(em
Asynchronous callbacks invoked from outside the
.I STREAMS
executive (at user context outside the
.BR qopen (9)
and
.BR qclose (9)
procedures, at soft interrupt other than STREAMS_SOFTIRQ and from within
interrupt service routines)
will never be synchronized with the
.I STREAMS
framework.

Normally, the caller-supplied timeout callback function can execute at any time; however,
.BR timeout (9),
.BR itimeout (9),
.BR dtimeout (9)
uses CPU binding to ensure that the timeout callback will be executed on the
same processor that raised the timeout.  The callback function will not
execute until after
.BR timeout (9)

returns and the calling thread encounters a preemption point.  Private locks

The callback function can execute at any time, asynchronous with other

When the callback function is executed, no synchronization is performed on any
module, stream, queue pair or queue before calling the function.

.SS Locking
.PP
Following is a discussion of the locking used in
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" :
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
performs reference counting on all
.I STREAMS
objects.  Reference counting ensures that objects are not destroyed until the last reference to them
is released.  This means that no reference will be invalidated while it is still being used.  There
are several primary
.I STREAMS
object upon which most other references depend:
the driver,
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure;
the module
.BR fmodsw (9)
structure;
the Stream head,
.BR stdata (9)
structure; the queue,
.BR queue (9)
structure;
the synchronization queue,
.BR syncq (9)
structure.
.PP
Of these, the most delicate and complicated references are the reference to the Stream head,
.BR stdata (9)
structure from the
.B inode
and
.B file
pointer.
.PP
To protect the reference to a Stream head,
.BR stdata (9)
structure, from the
.BR inode ,
the
.B inode
semaphore is acquired before referencing from, or invalidating the reference to, the Stream head.
This is also true for the
.B file
pointer
.IR private_data :
we hold the
.B inode
semaphore while acquiring a reference to the Stream head via the
.B file
pointer, and also hold the sempahore while clearing the
.I private_data
pointer.
(This means a fair amount of sempahore taking and releasing when performing system calls.  Perhaps
the inode spinlock might have been a better idea.)
.PP
The Stream head has associated with it a queue pair.  While the Stream head reference is valid,
there always exists a Stream head queue pair.
