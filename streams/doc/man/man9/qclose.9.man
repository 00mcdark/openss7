.I q
is a pointer to the module or driver's read queue.
.TP
.I flag
is a close flag that contains a bitwise or of one or more of the following
flags:

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qclose ()
closes a
.I STREAMS
module or driver by calling the queue's
.I q->q_info->qi_close
procedure (if it exists).
.BR qclose ()
is invoked on the last close of a
.I STREAMS
character special file.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qclose ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function that is not intended to be called directly by
the module writer.  See
.BR close (2s)
and

under
.BR streamio (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR qclose ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
