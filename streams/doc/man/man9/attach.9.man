.BR attach ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
defined.

.BR attach ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS

differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR attach ()
only provides functionality comparable to

drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR attach ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
