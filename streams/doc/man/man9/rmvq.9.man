.SH NAME
.B rmvq
\- remove a message from a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void rmvq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue from which to remove the message.
.PD 0
.TP
.I mp
the message to remove from the queue.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
removes the message pointed to by
.I mp
from the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
The message can be removed from the middle of the queue and does not need to
be at the head or tail of the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
can be called from any context including user context, queue procedures,
callouts, callbacks and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access
to the passed in message pointer,
.IR mp .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
uses a
.BR queue (9)
structure pointer in the
.BR msgb (9)
structure to determine to which queue (if any)
.I mp
belongs.  This increases the performance of the
.BR rmvq ()
function dramatically.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR getq (9),
.BR insq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4dk
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR rmvq ()
is always successful.
.IP ""
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR rmvq ()
silently fails if
the message pointer
.I mp
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.I q
is closing;
.I q
has put and service procedures turned off (e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9));
the message pointed to by
.I mp
does not exist on the queue
.IR q .
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will not pass
.B NULL
or invalid pointers to
.BR rmvq ().
.IP \(em
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
maintains a queue pointer within the
.BR msgb (9)
structure.  This permits immediate determination of whether the passed in
message pointer,
.IR mp ,
is a member of the queue,
.IR q .
It even permits ignoring the passed in
.I q
pointer.
.IP ""
.I LiS
does not maintain a pointer in the
.BR msgb (9)
structure to the queue to which a given message currently belongs.  This means
that
.I LiS
must search the queue pointed to by
.I q
for the message pointed to by
.I mp
using a linear search.  This is inefficient if
.BR rmvq ()
is called often by a
.IR STREAMS (4)
module or driver.
.IP \(em
.BR rmvq ()
does not panic if the message pointer,
.IR mp ,
points to a message not on queue,
.IR q .
.IP ""
.IR IRIX \(rg
documents that if the message pointer,
.IR mp ,
does not point to an existing message on queue,
.IR q ,
that the system could panic.

to
