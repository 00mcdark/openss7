.SH NAME
.B rmvq
\- remove a message from a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void rmvq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue from which to remove the message.
.TP
.I mp
the message to remove from the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
removes the message pointed to by
.I mp
from the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
The message can be removed from the middle of the queue and does not need to
be at the head or tail of the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
can be called from any context including user context, queue procedures,
callouts, callbacks and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access
to the passed in message pointer,
.IR mp .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
uses a
.BR queue (9)
structure pointer in the
.BR msgb (9)
structure to determine to which queue (if any)
.I mp
belongs.  This increases the performance of the
.BR rmvq ()
function dramatically.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR insq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg
and LiS
.[
LiS
.]
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR rmvq ()
is always successful.
.IP "" 4
Under LiS,
.BR rmvq ()
silently fails if
the message pointer
.I mp
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.I q
is closing;
.I q
has put and service procedures turned off (e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9));
the message pointed to by
.I mp
does not exist on the queue
.IR q .
.IP \(em
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
mainatins a queue pointer within the
.BR msgb (9)
structure.  This permits immediate determination of whether the passed in
message pointer,
.IR mp ,
is a member of the queue,
.IR q .
It even permits ignoring the passed in
.I q
pointer.
.IP "" 4
LiS does not maintain a pointer in the
.BR msgb (9)
structure to the queue to which a given message currently belongs.  This means
that LiS must search the queue pointed to by
.I q
for the message pointed to by
.I mp
using a linear search.  This is inefficient if
.BR rmvq ()
is called often by a
.IR STREAMS (4)
module or driver.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
require that a stream be frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
for the duration of the call to
.BR rmvq ().
.PP
Symbol
.BR lis_rmvq ()
is provided for binary compatibility with LiS.  See
.BR lisbcm (9).
.BR lis_rmvq ()
simply calls
.BR rmvq ().
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
