.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mapsize
the number of segments in the resource map (including the two system defined
segments).  This is really just the size of the array to allocate.
.TP
.I map
the map to free previously returned by
.BR rmallocmap ()
or
.BR rmallocmap_wait ().
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR rmallocmap ()
and
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
allocate a
.B struct map
structure array of size
.I mapsize
and return a pointer to the allocated and initialized array.  The array is
initialized as though it were initialized with
.BR rminit (9).
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
differs from
.BR rmallocmap ()
in that if memory is not immediately available, the calling process will block
until memory becomes available.
.PP
.BR rmfreemap ()
frees the map structure returned by
.BR rmallocmap ()
or
.BR rmallocmap_wait ().
It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the map structure passed to
.BR rmfreemap ()
does not have any waiting processes and has no resources allocated.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR rmallocmap ()
and
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
allocate the map structure array of size
.I mapsize
and return a pointer to the base of the array.
Upon failure,
.BR rmallocmap ()
and
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
return
.BR NULL .
.PP
.BR rmfreemap ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR rmallocmap ()
and
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
fail when memory cannot be allocated, or
.I mapsize
is too small (less than 3).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR rmallocmap ()
and
.BR rmfreemap ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
can be called from any blockable context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR rmallocmap ()
and
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
are MP-safe: the caller has exclusive access to the returned map pointer.
.BR rmfreemap ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller must ensure exclusive access to the passed in map.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that should not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must have also been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.
.PP
.BR rmallocmap ()
and
.BR rmfreemap ()
are
.IR UnixWare \(rg-
and
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
functions that should not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.B _SUN_SOURCE
or
.B _UW7_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose these symbols.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS

defined.
.PP
The functions
.BR kmem_zalloc (9),
.BR rminit (9)
and
.BR kmem_free (9)
should be used instead of either of these functions.

have no known bugs.

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR rmallocmap ()
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
and
.BR rmfreemap ()
are source-level compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR rmallocmap ()
and
.BR rmfreemap ()
are
.IR Solaris \(rg-
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
functions.
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function.
Neither of these functions should be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules: use
.BR kmem_zalloc (9),
.BR rminit (9)
and
.BR kmem_free (9)
instead.
.IP \(em
.BR rmallocmap ()
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
and
.BR rmfreemap ()
are provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR rmallocmap ()
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
and
.BR rmfreemap ()
only provide functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionalit provided by
.BR rmallocmap ()
.BR rmallocmap_wait ()
or
.BR rmfreemap ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

.BR STREAMS (9)
