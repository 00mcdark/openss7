.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The following members correspond to SVR 4.2 EFT members:
.TP \w'ms_xsize\(em'u
.I ms_pcnt
Count of the number of calls to the module
.IR qi_putp ()
procedure.
.TP
.I ms_scnt
Count of the number of calls to the module
.IR qi_srvp ()
procedure.
.TP
.I ms_ocnt
Count of the number of calls to the module
.IR qi_qopen ()
procedure.
.TP
.I ms_ccnt
Count of the number of calls to the module
.IR qi_qclose ()
procedure.
.TP
.I ms_acnt
Count of the number of calls to the module
.IR qi_qadmin ()
procedure.
.TP
.I ms_xprt
A pointer to the module's private statistics structure.  The format of this
structure is module specific and must be maintained by the module.
.TP
.I ms_xsize
The size of the module's private statistics structure.
.TP
.I ms_flags
Flags for boolean statistics (events).

.SH DESCRIPTION

.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
Functions that operate on a module information structure can be called from any
context.

.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Members of the
.B module_stat
structure should not be accessed directly by
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers after the structure has been registered with the
.B "Linux Fast-STREAMS"
executive.
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers should use the other facilities provided by
.BR strqget "(9) and " strqset (9)
for implementation and architecture independence.
.PP
The
.B module_stat
structure is only a subset of the implementation structure used by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler.  Additional hidden fields are present in the implementation
structure.
