.SH "NAME"
.B bcanput
\- test flow control on a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int bcanput(queue_t *" q ", int " band );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue from which to begin testing for flow control.
.TP
.I band
the priority band within which to test for flow control.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
module puting a banded non-priority data message
.RB ( M_PROTO ", " M_DATA )
to a subsequent message queue to check for flow control using
.BR bcanput ()
for the band associated with the message before placing a message on the queue
with
.BR putq (9).
.PP
.BR bcanput ()
checks whether the stream is flow controlled starting at the specified queue,
.IR q ,
and for the specified 
.IR band .
Starting at
.IR q ,
and for
.IR band ,
.BR bcanput ()
looks for the next forward queue which has a service routine or which has no
further forward queue.
.PP
If this forward queue has the
.B QB_FULL
flag clear indicating that it is not full for the specified
.IR band ,
.BR bcanput ()
will return true (1).
.PP
If this forward queue has the
.B QB_FULL
flag set indicating that it is full for the specified
.IR band ,
.BR bcanput ()
will return false (0).
.PP
When
.BR bcanput ()
returns false (0), it also sets the
.B QB_WANTW
flag for the specified
.IR band ,
indicating that the
.I STREAMS
scheduler should back-enable service
procedures backward up the queues when the flow controlled
.I band
is no longer full.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR bcanput ()
will return false (0) when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is flow
controlled for the specified band, and return true (1) when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is not flow controlled for the specified band.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR bcanput ()
always succeed.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR bcanput ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR bcanput ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller perform an unprotected pointer dereference.
That is,
.BR bcanputnext (9)
should always be called in preference to
.BI bcanput( q->q_next ).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
provides the additional feature that
.I band
can be specified as
.BR ANYBAND .
When
.I band
is
.BR ANYBAND ,
.BR bcanput ()
checks whether any band (other than band zero), is not flow controlled.  If a
band exists that is not flow controlled,
.BR bcanput ()
with
.B ANYBAND
returns one (1).
If all existing bands are flow controlled,
.BR bcanput ()
returns zero (0).

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR bcanput ()
is source-level compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixdoc
.]
indicates that if a
.BR qband (9)
structure does not exist for
.I band
that
.BR bcanput ()
returns true (1).
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
lists
.BR bcanput ()
as a function that can only be passed a queue pointer in the queue pair within
a queue's procedure.
.IP \(em
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxdoc
.]
indicates that the stream cannot be frozen when calling
.BR bcanput (9)
and that private locks cannot be held across the call.
.IP \(em
.BR bcanput ()
always succeeds.  Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR bcabput ()
will return zero (0 - flow controlled) if an internal error occurs, without
setting the
.BR QWANTW " or " QB_WANTW
flag for the queue or band.  This means that, although flow controlled, no
backenable procedure will be run.  This can lead to indefinite postponement of
a queue service procedure under
.IR LiS .
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.BR bcanput ()
does not have this problem.
.IP \(em
The declaration for
.BR bcanput ()
provides that
.I band
is of type
.BR int .
Under
.IR "SVR 4.2 DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and other systems based on
.IR "SVR 4",
.I band
is
.BR "unsigned char" .
.IP \(em
Symbol
.BR lis_bcanput ()
and
.BR lis_bcanput_anyband ()
are provided for compatibility with
.IR LiS .
See
.BR lisbcm (9).
.BR lis_bcanput ()
and
.BR lis_bcanput_anyband ()
simply call
.BR bcanput ()
directly.
.IP \(em
.BR bcanput ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR bcanput ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR bcanput ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
