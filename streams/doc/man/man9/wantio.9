.SH NAME
.B wantio
\- perform direct I/O from a \fISTREAMS\fR driver
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _AIX_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int wantio(queue_t *" q ", struct wantio *" w );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
The driver queue pointer calling the function.
.TP
.I w
a pointer to a
.B waitio
structure that contains the IO functions to call directly from the stream
head.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When
.I w
is
.RB non- NULL ,
.BR wantio ()
installs the direct IO functions specified in the 
.B wantio
structure pointed to by
.I w
into the stream head associated with the driver queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.PP
When
.I w
is
.BR NULL ,
.BR wantio ()
removes any direct IO functions installed by a previous call to
.BR wantio ().
.PP
The
.B wantio
structure is formatted as follows:
.nf
\fC\s-2
struct wantio {
        unsigned int (*poll) ();
        ssize_t (*read)();
        ssize_t (*write) ();
        ssize_t (*readv) ();
        ssize_t (*writev) ();
        ssize_t (*sendpage) ();
};
\s+2\fP
.fi
.TP
.IR poll ()
.TP
.IR read ()
.TP
.IR write ()
.TP
.IR readv ()
.TP
.IR writev ()
.TP
.IR sendpage ()
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR wantio ()
always returns zero (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR wantio ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR wantio ()
can be invoked from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR wantio ()
is MP-safe and neither takes nor releases locks.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Before calling
.BR wantio ()
for an active stream,
the following steps should be performed by the driver:
.IP (1)
Send a
.B M_LETSPLAY
message upstream with a
.B strlp
structure in the message.  The
.B strlp
structure is formatted as follows:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-2
struct strlp {
        int lp_count;
        queue_t *lp_queue;
};
\s+2\fP
.fi
.TP
.I lp_count
Initially set to zero by the driver, this count is incremented by each module
that recognizes the
.B M_LETSPLAY
message type and will permit direct IO to the driver.  Once the
.B M_LETSPLAY
message reaches the stream head, the stream head compares this count with the
number of modules pushed on the stream.  If the two are equal, the stream head
returns an
.B M_BACKDONE
message.  If the two are different, the stream head returns an
.B M_DONTPLAY
message.
.TP
.I lp_queue
A pointer to the driver's write queue.
.RE
.IP ""
When an intervening module receives an
.B M_BACKDONE
message, it delivers all queued data as
.B M_BACKWASH
messages, and any
.B M_BACKWASH
messages received from upstream,
and sends the
.B M_BACKDONE
message downstream.
In this way, all queue data is delivered to the driver's write queue as
.B M_BACKWASH
messages followed by a
.B M_BACKDONE
message.
.IP (2)
Wait for an
.B M_DONTPLAY
or
.B M_BACKDONE
message received on the write queue.
.IP (3)
If an
.B M_DONTPLAY
message is received, the driver cannot call
.BR waitio ().
.IP (4)
If an
.B M_BACKDONE
message is rceived, the driver can handle any
.B M_BACKWASH
messages representing pushed data and call
.BR waitio ().
