.SH NAME
.B cmn_err
\- print a kernel command error
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/cmn_err.h>
.HP
.BI "cmn_err(int " err_lvl ", char *" fmt ", " ... );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP \w'\ err_lvl\ 'u
.I err_lvl
the error level associated with the log.
.TP
.I fmt
the
.B printf
format for the log.
.TP
.I ...
the arguments of the
.B printf
format.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
prints a command error message to kernel log files at the level specified by
.I err_lev
and with the
.BR printk (9)
formatted format string
.I fmt
and associated variable arguments.
.PP
.I err_lvl
may be one of the following values:
.TP \w'\ CE_PANIC\ 'u
.B CE_CONT
This level indicates to continue printing.
.TP
.B CE_NOTE
This error level is for notices.  Notices are important events which should be
logged.
This equates to a
.B KERN_NOTICE
level in
.BR Linux .
.TP
.B CE_WARN
This error level is for warnings.  These are critical conditions, however,
these errors do not halt the kernel.
This equates to a
.B KERN_WARNING
level in
.BR Linux .
.TP
.B CE_PANIC
This error level is a panic error level.  This is for highly critical errors
where the kernel has destabilized and it is necessary to halt the kernel.
.RS
.PP
When the
.I err_lvl
is specified as
.BR CE_PANIC ,
.BR cmn_err ()
will generate a
.B Linux
kernel panic with the resulting message.
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Unlike
.BR printk (9),
.BR cmn_err ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
fails silently when the
.I err_lvl
is invalid or formatting of the message
per
.I fmt
and the variable arguments fails.

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
