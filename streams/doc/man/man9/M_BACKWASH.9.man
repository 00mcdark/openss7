.SH NAME
.B M_BACKWASH
\- \fISTREAMS\fP backwash direct I/O message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_BACKWASH
message is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains no data.
Attached to the
.B M_BACKWASH
message is a normal
.BR M_PROTO "(9) and " M_DATA (9)
message or
.BR M_PCPROTO "(9) and " M_DATA (9)
message.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B M_BACKWASH
is a message used in conjunction with
.BR M_BACKDONE (9),
.BR M_LETSPLAY (9),
and
.BR M_DONTPLAY (9)
to coordinate the establishment of direct IO from the driver, bypassing the stream head and any
pushed modules, using the
.BR wantio (9)
utility.  See
.BR wantio (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Before calling
.BR wantio (9)
for an active stream, and shifting from normal stream head IO to driver direct IO,
the following steps should be performed by the driver:
.IP (1) \w'(0)\(em'u
Send a
.BR M_LETSPLAY (9)
message upstream with a
.B strlp
structure in the message.
.IP ""
Once the
.BR M_LETSPLAY (9)
message reaches the stream head, the stream head compares the
.I lp_count
count with the number of modules pushed on the stream.  If the two are equal, all modules pushed on
the stream agree to driver direct IO, and the stream head returns an
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message.  If the two are different, some module pushed on the stream does not agree to driver direct
IO, and the stream head returns an
.BR M_DONTPLAY (9)
message.
.IP (2)
Wait for an
.BR M_DONTPLAY (9)
or
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message received on the write queue.
.IP ""
When an intervening module receives an
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message, it delivers all queued data as
.B M_BACKWASH
messages, and any
.B M_BACKWASH
messages received from upstream,
and sends the
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message downstream.
In this way, all queue data is delivered to the driver's write queue as
.B M_BACKWASH
messages followed by a
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message.
.IP (3)
If an
.BR M_DONTPLAY (9)
message is received, the driver cannot call
.BR wantio (9).
.IP (4)
If an
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message is received, the driver can handle any
.B M_BACKWASH
messages representing pushed data and then call
.BR wantio (9).

.SH NOTICES

.B M_BACKWASH
is an
.IR AIX \(rg

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
A canonical handling of
.B M_BACKWASH
messages in a module's write-side (downstream)
.BR put (9)

.BR srv (9)
procedure is as follows:
.nf

/* module put procedure */
int xxx_putp(queue_t *q, mblk_t *mp)
{
    switch (mp->b_datap->db_type) {

    case M_BACKDONE:
    case M_DONTPLAY:
#if have_service_procedure
        putq(q, mp);
#else
        putnext(q, mp);
#endif
        break;
    ...
