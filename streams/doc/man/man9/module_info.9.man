.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The following members correspond to SVR 4.2 EFT members:
.TP \w'mi_maxpsz\(em'u
.I mi_idnum
The module identification number.  This number is unique across all
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers.  It can be assigned by the module at
.I STREAMS
module initialization, or the module can request that the
.I STREAMS
executive assign a unique number.
.TP
.I mi_idname
The module name.  This name is unique across all
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers.  It must be assigned by the module at
.I STREAMS
module initialization.
.TP
.I mi_minpsz
The minimum packet size accepted.  This is the minimum size of a
.I STREAMS
message that will be accepted by the stream head on write.
.TP
.I mi_maxpsz
The maximum packet size accepted.  This is the maximum size of a
.I STREAMS
message that will be accepted by the stream head on write.
.TP
.I mi_hiwat
The high water mark for flow control.  For modules with a service procedure,
this is the number of octets of queued messages beyond which the queue will be
considered flow controlled.
.TP
.I mi_lowat
The low water mark for flow control.  For modules with a service procedrue,
this is the number of octents of queue messages beneath which the queue will
be considered no longer flow controlled and back-enabling will occur.

.SH DESCRIPTION

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
Functions that operat on a module information structure can be called from any
context.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Members of the
.B module_info
structure should not be accessed directly by
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers after the structure has been registered with the
.B "Linux Fast-STREAMS"
executive.
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers should use the other facilities provided by
.BR strqget "(9) and " strqset (9)
for implementation and architecture independence.
.PP
The
.B module_info
structu is only a subset of the implementation structure used by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler.  Additional hidden fields are present in the implementation
structure.
