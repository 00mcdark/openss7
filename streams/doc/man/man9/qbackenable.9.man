.I q
the queue to back enable from;
.PD 0

the (highest) band number to back-enable; and,

an optional pointer to an array of flags, one for each band, that indicates precisely which bands to
back-enable.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qbackenable ()
performs the back-enabling operations of
.I STREAMS
utilities such as
.BR getq (9),
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR flushq (9),
and
.BR flushband (9).
When any of these functions is called and the call results in a queue or queue band becoming
unblocked with regard to flow control,
.BR qbackenable ()
will be called to effect the back-enabling of the queue.
.PP
For
.BR getq (9)
and
.BR rmvq (9),
only one queue or queue band can become unblocked (since only one message is removed from the
message queue).  For these operations the
.I bands
argument is
.BR NULL .
For
.BR flushq (9)
and
.BR flushband (9),
multiple queue bands can become unblocked.  For these functions,
.I band
indicates the highest band number that has become unblocked, and
.I bands
is an array of
.B NBAND
elements of type
.BR "unsigned char" ,
each containing a single flag that is set when the corresponding band has become unblocked.
.PP
If the queue to be back-enabled is anything but a
Stream head write queue, the queue is simply enabled with
.BR qenable (9).
When the queue to be enabled is a Stream head write queue,
.BR qbackenable ()
sets the corresponding
.B QBACK
or
.B QB_BACK
bit for every queue or queue band for which flow control has subsided.  This is so that the Stream
head write service procedure can indicate
.B S_WRNORM
and
.B S_WRBAND
events under the proper situations [see
.BR I_SETSIG (7)],
and also so the corresponding
.RI { SIGPOLL }
signal can have the appropriate band number populated in the
.I POSIX
extended signal information,
.IR si_band .
.\"
.SS Back-Enabling
.PP
Back-enabling occurs in
.I STREAMS
when a previously flow controlled queue or queue band, becomes unblocked.
A flow controlled queue or queue band is one for which
.B QFULL
or
.B QB_FULL
was set by
.BR canput (9),
.BR canputnext (9),
.BR bcanput (9),
.BR bcanputnext (9),
because the
.IR q_count " or " qb_count
for the queue exceeded the
.IR q_hiwat " or " qb_hiwat
high water thresholds.
A queue or queue band becomes unblocked, when
.B QFULL
or
.B QB_FULL
is cleared by
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR getq (9),
because the
.IR q_count " or " qb_count
falls beneath the
.IR q_lowat " or " qb_lowat
low water thresholds, or the queue or queue band becomes empty.

.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qbackenable ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qbackenable ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qbackenable ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, call-outs, callbacks, soft
interrupts, and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qbackenable ()
is MP-safe.
Because
.BR qbackenable ()
can be invoked outside of
.IR STREAMS ,
(note that
.BR getq (9)
or other functions invoking
.BR qbackenable ()
can be called from outside
.IR STREAMS ),
it acquires a Stream head plumbing read lock for
the Stream head of the Stream containing
.IR q .
This protects dereference of
.I q_next
pointers along the Stream during the call, regardless of context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qbackenable ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function which was not intended to be called by
the
.I STREAMS
module or driver writer.
.BR qbackenable ()
is not part of the DDI/DKI and should not be called by portable programs.
.BR qbackenable ()
is highly implementation dependent in function and prototype.  Use of this
function by a driver or module will guarantee that it is not portable even between
releases of
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
