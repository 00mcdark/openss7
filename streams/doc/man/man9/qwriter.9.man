.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br

.BI "void qwriter(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp ", void (*" func ")(queue_t *, mblk_t *), int " perim );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
a pointer to the queue for which to upgrade to writer.
.TP
.I mp
a
.I STREAMS
message to pass to the callback function.
.TP
.I func
a function that will be called when write access has been achieved.
.TP
.I perim
a description of the perimeter.
.I perim
can be either
.BR PERIM_INNER " or " PERIM_OUTER .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
schedules the call-out function,
.IR func ,
to be executed with the specified queue pair,
.IR q ,
and the passed in message,
.IR mp ,
once the perimeter,
.IR perim ,
can be entered exclusively.
.PP
.I perim
can be one of the following values:
.TP
.B PERIM_INNER
establishes exclusive access to the inner perimeter
for the queue,
.IR q ,
when present.  An inner
perimeter can exist at the queue, the queue pair or the module.
See
.BR mp-streams (9)
for more information.
If an inner perimeter does not exist, the call-out function is still executed,
but synchronization does not occur.
(This has a similar effect to
.BR qprocsoff (9),
although
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is a different mechanism.)
.TP
.B PERIM_OUTER
establishes exclusive access to the outer perimeter
for the module to which
.I q
belongs,
when present.  An outer
perimeter can exist at the module.
See
.BR mp-streams (9)
for more information.
If an outer perimeter does not exist, the call-out function is still executed,
but synchronization does not occur.
(This has a similar effect to
.BR freezestr (9),
although
.BR freezestr (9)
is a different mechanism.)
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
allows
.RI non- STREAMS
software to safely call
.I STREAMS
utilities.
.RI Non- STREAMS
code can call
.BR qwriter (),
passing it a function and a queue pointer,
.IR q .
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
runs the function as it it were the queue's
.BR qi_putp (9)
procedure.  The function can safely manipulate the queue and access the same
data structure as the queue's
.BR qi_putp (9)
procedure.
.BR qwriter ()
passes
.IR q " and " mp " to " proc .
The caller must pass a valid message block pointer,
.IR mp ,
because
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses fields in the message block not visible to the
.I STREAMS
programmer.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
can only be called by a 
.IR qi_putp (9)
or 
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure or from a queue callback function (see
.BR qtimeout (9)
or
.BR qbufcall (9)).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
is MP-safe and was intended to support MP-safe operation in the SMP
is MP-safe.
.PP
Considerations should be given when writing the call-out function that the
function may execute in parallel with asynchronous entry points, callbacks,
call-outs and interrupt service procedures.
.PP
However, in
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" ,
the call-out function is scheduled on the same CPU and the CPU which called
.BR qwriter ().
This means that
.BR qwriter ()
will return before the call-out function executes when called on the ICS.
Also, when called on the ICS, the call-out function will not execute before
the calling function returns or the next preemption point is encountered.
will return before the call-out function executes.  In addition, the call-out
function will not execute before the calling function returns or the next
preemption point is encountered.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
must only be called from a queue
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
may return before the call-out function,
.IR func ,
executes, or the call-out function,
.IR func ,
may be executed on the calling thread before
.BR qwriter ()
returns.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses
a single mechanism,
.BR __strwrit (),
for supporting all queue writer functions such as
.BR qwriter ()
and
.BR mps_become_writer (9),
and a single mechanism,
.BR __strfunc (),
for supporting all queue put function such as
.BR streams_put (9).
.PP
When called on the ICS, execution of the call-out function is deferrred until
the next run of the
.I STREAMS
scheduler,
.BR strqsched (9),
and the function simply returns.
When called from any other context, synchronization is performed and the call-out function is executed immediately thereafter
and before returning.  See
.BR mp-streams (9)
for more information.

.SH BUGS

has no known bugs.

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
is source level compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qwriter ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this
symbol.
.IP \(em
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
and
.IR LiS ,
do not provide this function.
.IP \(em
.BR qwriter ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The standard
.BR freezestr (9)
and
.BR put (9)
functions should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR qwriter ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.ip \(em
.BR qwriter ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR qwriter ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
