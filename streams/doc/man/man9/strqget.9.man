\- gets information about a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int strqget(queue_t *" q ", qfields_t " what ", unsigned char " band ", long *" val );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to retrieve parameters.
.TP
.I what
which parameter to retrieve.
.TP
.I band
the queue band for which to retrieve parameters.
.TP
.I val
the pointer to where the retrieved value is to be placed.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR strqget ()
returns the value or pointer requested by
.I what
for the queue pointed to by
.I q
and band specified by
.I band
into the memory area pointed to by
.IR val .
The attribute retrieved can be either a scalar or a pointer.
.PP
When
.I band
is zero,
.BR strqget ()
will retrieve the attribute specified by
.I what
for the queue.
When
.I band
is non-zero (between 1 and 255),
.BR strqget ()
will retrieve the attribute specified by
.I what
for the queue band specified by
.IR band .
.PP
The argument
.I what
specifies which queue (or queue band if
.I band
is non-zero) attribute is to be retrieved.
.I what
can be one of the following values:
.TP
.B QHIWAT
Gets the high water mark associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QLOWAT
Gets the low water mark associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QCOUNT
Gets the count of bytes associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QFIRST
Gets the first message pointer associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QLAST
Gets the last message pointer associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QFLAG
Gets the flags associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QMAXPSZ
Gets the maximum packet size associated with the
.IR q .
For this operation
.I band
must be zero (0).
.TP
.B QMINPSZ
Gets the minimum packet size associated with the
.IR q .
For this operation
.I band
must be zero (0).
.PP
.BR strqget ()
provides a mechanism whereby a
.IR STREAMS (4)
module or driver can access information
about a queue or queue band without directly accessing the
.B queue
or
.B qband
structures.
Values retrieved by
.BR strqget ()
are equivalent to directly accessing the
.B queue
or
.B qband
structure members described below.
.PP
The
.B queue
structure contains at least the following members:
.HP
.BI "ulong " q_hiwat
\- the high water mark for the queue.
.HP
.BI "ulong " q_lowat
\- the low water mark for the queue.
.HP
.BI "ulong " q_count
\- the count of the number of bytes in the queue.
.HP
.BI "struct msgb *" q_first
\- the first message in the queue.
.HP
.BI "struct msgb *" q_last
\- the last message in the queue.
.HP
.BI "ulong " q_flag
\- the flags associated with the queue, see
.BR "\*(lqQueue Flags\*(rq" ,
above.
.HP
.BI "long " q_maxpsz
\- the maximum message size accepted by the queue.
.HP
.BI "long " q_minpsz
\- the minimum message size accepted by the queue.
.PP
The
.B qband
structure contains at least the following members:
.HP
.BI "ulong " qb_hiwat
\- the high water mark for the band.
.HP
.BI "ulong " qb_lowat
\- the low water mark for the band.
.HP
.BI "ulong " qb_count;
\- the count of the number of bytes in the band.
.HP
.BI "struct msgb *" qb_first
\- the first message in the band.
.HP
.BI "struct msgb *" qb_last
\- the last message in the band.
.HP
.BI "ulong " qb_flag
\- the flags associated with the band, see
.BR "\*(lqQueue Band Flags\*(rq" ,
above.

.SS "Queue Flags"
.PP
When
.BR strqget ()
is called with
.I what
set to
.B QFLAG
and
.I band
is set to zero (0),
.BR strqget ()
returns the queue flags in the area pointed to by
.IR val .
The queue flags in the area pointed to by
.I val
can contain the following flags:
.TP
.B QENAB
set when the queue is enabled.
.TP
.B QWANTR
set when the previous queue wants to read.
.TP
.B QWANTW
set when the previous queue wants to write.
.TP
.B QFULL
set when the queue is full.  The queue is full when the count of
bytes in the queue is greater than the high water mark for the
queue.
.TP
.B QREADR
set when the queue is the reader.
.TP
.B QUSE
set when the queue is not free.
.TP
.B QNOENB
set when the queue is not to be enabled.
.\".TP
.\".B QBACK
.\"set when the queue is a back-enabled queue.
.\".TP
.\".B QRETRY
.\"set when the retry timer is set for the queue.
.\".TP
.\".B QSCAN
.\"set when the queue is in the scan list.
.\".TP
.\".B QCLOSING

.\".TP
.\".B QWASFULL
.\"set when the queue was previously full (QFULL was set) but the
.\"queue count has not yet dropped to the low water mark.
.\".TP
.\".B QCLOSEWT
.\"set when the stream head is waiting for the queue to drain.
.\".TP
.\".B QPROCSOFF
.\"set when the put and service procedures for the queue are turned off.
.\".TP
.\".B QRUNNING
.\"set while the queue's service procedure is running.

.SS "Queue Band Flags"
.PP
When
.BR strqget ()
is called with
.I what
set to
.B QFLAG
and
.I band
is set between 1 and 255,
.BR strqget ()
returns the queue band flags associated with
.I band
in the area pointed to by
.IR val .
The queue band flags in the area pointed to by
.I val
can contain the following flags:
.TP
.B QB_FULL
set when the queue band is full.  The queue band is full when the count of the
bytes in the queue band is greater than the high water mark for the queue
band.
.TP
.B QB_WANTW
set when the previous queue wants to write to this queue band.
.\".TP
.\".B QB_BACK
.\"set when the queue band is back-enabled.
.\".TP
.\".B QB_WASFULL
.\"set when the queue band was previously full (QB_FULL was set) but the queue
.\"band count has not yet dropped to the low water mark for the queue band.

.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR strqget ()
returns zero (0) and places the appropriate value in the
memory area pointed to by
.IR val .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR strqget ()
returns a non-zero error number.
The memory area pointed to by
.I val
remains unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR strqget ()
fails,
it returns one of the following errors:
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The value pointer
.I val
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL;
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
the queue band specified in
.I band
does not exist;
.BR QMAXPSZ " or " QMINPSZ
was specified for
.I what
and
.I band
was non-zero;
.I what
is not a valid queue or queue band attribute.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR strqget ()
can be called from any context including user context, queue procedures,
callouts, callbacks and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR strqget ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
Calling
.BR strqget ()
on a queue and stream previously frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
could result in single-party deadlock.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR strqget ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR strqget ()
is source-level compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.IR Solaris \(rg
and LiS
.[
LiS
.]
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR strqget ()
only returns defined flags.
LiS defines a number of queue flags that are not elsewhere defined, yet
returns those flags from a call to
.BR strqget ().
LiS should mask off its private flags when returning flags from a call to
.BR strqget ().
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
require that a stream be frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
for the duration of the call to
.BR strqget ().
.PP
Symbol
.BR lis_strqget ()
is provided for binary compatibility with LiS.  See
.BR lisbcm (9).
.BR lis_strqget ()
calls
.BR strqget ()
directly.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
