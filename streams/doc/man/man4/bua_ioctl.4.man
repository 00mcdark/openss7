supports IO controls based on the Local Management Interface IO controls,
.BR lmi_ioctl (4).
.B BUA-IOCTL
supports the UA managed object model,
.BR ua_ioctl (4).
.B BUA-IOCTL
supports the BICC IO controls,
.BR bicci_ioctl (4).
.PP
.B BUA-IOCTL
defines the additional structures and constants necessary to use these IO
controls with the
.BR bua (4)
driver.
