.SH NAME
.B h248
\- MEGACO/H.248 Media Gateway Control
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <ss7/mgi.h>

.B #include <ss7/mgi_ioctl.h>
.br
.B #include <ss7/h248_ioctl.h>
.HP
.BI "int " h248_stream " = open(" \fR/dev/h248\fI ", " flags );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B H248
is an implementation of the
.I Megaco Protocol Version 1.0
as described in
.B "RFC 3015"
and
.B ITU-T Reocmmendation H.248.1.
.PP
.B H248
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.PP
.BR mg (4)
stream, or streams conforming to the Media Gateway Interface (MGI),
.BR mgi (7),
can be
.IR I_LINK ed
or
.IR I_PLINK ed
under the
.IR h248_stream ,
to provide MG services to the multiplexing driver.
.BR mgi (7)
streams linked in this fashion must first be configured for use using the
.BR h248_ioctl (4)
IO controls.  This function is normally performed by the MG Configuration
Daemon,
.RB mgconfd (8).
.PP
Transport streams conforming to the Transport Provider Interface (TPI),
.BR tpi (7),
such as
.BR tcp (4)
or
.BR sctp (4),
can also be
.IR I_LINK ed
or
.IR I_PLINK ed
under the
.IR h248_stream ,
to provide transport services for communicating with remote MG or MGC hosts.
.BR tpi (7)
streams linked in this fashion must first be configured for use using the
.BR h248_ioctl (4)
IO controls.  This function is normally performed by the MG Configuration
Daemon,
.RB mgconfd (8).
.PP
.B H248
provides the following devices:
.TP
.I /dev/h248
This device provide a Media Gateway Interface (MGI) as described in
.BR mgi (7),
integrated for
.B H.248
operation as described in
.BR mgi_h248 (7).
This device is suitable for use with the
.BR mgc (4)
driver, or other MG modules and drivers, or for direct use by user-level
programs such as the
.B OpenSwitch
call framework library,
.BR cframe (3).
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
.B H248
provides the common set of Local Managemenet IO controls accessible using
.BR ioctl (2)
or
.I I_STR
command to the
.BR streamio (7)
system calls, as described in
.BR lmi_ioctl (4),
interpreted for use by
.B H248
as described in
.BR h248_ioctl (4).
These IO controls, and the IO controls described for MGI devices in
.BR mgi_ioctl (4),
are available on the
.I h248_stream
file descriptor.
