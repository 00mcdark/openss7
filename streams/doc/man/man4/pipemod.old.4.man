.TH PIPEMOD 4 "$Date: 2004/03/07 22:49:10 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux Fast-STREAMS Devices"
.SH NAME
.B pipemod
\- \fISTREAMS\fR module supporting flush handling in \fISTREAMS\fR \fBfifos\fR and \fBpipes\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pipemod
module has the relatively simple task of reversing the sense of the
.B FLUSH
flag bits in
.B M_FLUSH
messages sent in
.I STREAMS
.I fifos
and
.IR pipes .
This must happen at the
.I midpoint
of a
.I fifo
or
.IR pipe ,
so that
.B FLUSHR
becomes
.BR FLUSHW ,
and
.B FLUSHW
becomes
.BR FLUSHR .
.B pipemod
does this, and has no other function.
.sp
To be used appropriately, then,
.B pipemod
must be the first module pushed onto a pipe end or a fifo, but it is
only necessary on one end of a pipe.
.sp
.B pipemod
is not needed if flush handling need not be supported, or if it its
function is supported by other means.
