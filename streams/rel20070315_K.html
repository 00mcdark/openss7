The <cite>OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS</cite> package is a High-Performance STREAMS framework for
Linux that is compatible with SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS and a host of other commercial UNIX(R) STREAMS
implementations, with complete debugging and production release capabilities.  It is as a
high-performance, production replacement for the buggy and now deprecated Linux STREAMS (LiS).
