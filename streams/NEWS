* Major changes for streams-0.7a-3

  Updated to common build process.  Documentation updates.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a-2

  Removed all XTI/TLI and Linux networking code, headers and documentation
  from streams distribution and set epoch at 0.  Linux networking code has
  been migrated to the strxnet, strinet and strsctp packages.  The purpose for
  doing this was to allow the Linux networking to build against Linux
  Fast-STREAMS as well as Linux STREAMS and is a preparation for phasing out
  LiS and phasing in LfS.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a-1

  This is the initial release of the Linux Fast-STREAMS package for Linux.
  This is intended as a high-performance, production replacement for Linux
  STREAMS (LiS).  Linux Fast-STREAMS has the following features:

  - optimized for Linux kernels.
  - prepared for mainstream Linux kernel adoption.
  - lindented and follows kernel coding practices.
  - compatibility modes for AIX, HPUX, OSF, Solaris, UnixWare, SVR 4.2 and LiS.
  - supports all major SVR4.2 variants.
  - licensed under GPL with commercial licensing available.
  - supports full SVR 4.2 MP synchronization models.
  - runs at SoftIRQ.
  - provides common SVR 4.2 system tunable parameters and sysctls.
  - provides /proc filesystem access for debugging and performance tuning.
  - provides a full set of common STREAMS modules and drivers.
  - provides full name-streams device and shadow special filesystem support.
