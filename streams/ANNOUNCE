streams-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

The `OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS' package is a High-Performance
"STREAMS" framework for `Linux' that is compatible with `SVR 4.2 MP'
"STREAMS" and a host of other commercial `UNIX(R)' "STREAMS"
implementations, with complete debugging and production release
capabilities.  It is as a high-performance, production replacement for
the buggy and now deprecated `Linux STREAMS (LiS)'.

This is the tenth `OpenSS7 Project' release of `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.
The release number has been moved from the 0.9a sequence to 0.9.2 to
indicate that the package has moved to a production grade.  `LiS' has
been fully deprecated by this release and `Linux Fast-STREAMS' is now
the only STREAMS package contained in the OpenSS7 Master Package
(`openss7-0.9.2.D').

This release is a stable, production grade release for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  The release is primarily a maintenance release.  Some
minor defect corrections have been applied, but no significant
development has occurred.  The release provides the following
enhancements and fixes:

   - Testing of, and a few bug corrections to, the strlog() feature.
     Trace and error logging working well.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - The package now builds a replacement libLiS and libpLiS library so
     that user applications written to work with LiS-2.18.1 through
     LiS-2.18.4 do no need to be recompiled.  Added versioning of all
     library symbols in all three libraries.

   - Minor bug fixes to STREAMS library.  isastream(3) and fattach(3)
     must not contain an asynchronous thread cancellation point, but
     they could.  Added asynchronous thread cancellation protection to
     these functions to remove any thread cancellation points.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them
     against 64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make
     installcheck' target will now automatically test both 64-bit
     native and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on
     64-bit platforms.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Updated `init' scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.
     `streams' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: `LiS' cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.


_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs,
see the streams package page (http://www.openss7.org/streams_pkg.html).

See `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/streams-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog' and
`http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/streams-0.9.2.1/NEWS' in the release
for more information.  Also, see the `STREAMS.pdf' manual in the
release (also in html `http://www.openss7.org/STREAMS_manual.html').

Package streams-0.9.2.3 was released under GPLv2 2007-06-23.

The OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS package is a High-Performance "STREAMS"
framework for Linux that is compatible with SVR 4.2 MP "STREAMS" and a
host of other commercial UNIX(R) "STREAMS" implementations, with
complete debugging and production release capabilities.  It is as a
high-performance, production replacement for the buggy and now
deprecated Linux STREAMS (LiS).

This is the twelveth OpenSS7 Project release of Linux Fast-STREAMS.  LiS
was fully deprecated as of the previous release and Linux Fast-STREAMS
is the only STREAMS package contained in the OpenSS7 Master Package
(since openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is a stable, production grade release.  The release
includes maintenance support for recent distributions and tool chain,
but also includes some performance and feature upgrades and inspection
bug fixes.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

 - Support build on openSUSE 10.2.

 - Support build on Fedora 7 and 2.6.21 kernel.

 - The strace(8), strerr(8) utilities and log(4) driver have had some
   corrections.  The STREAMS trace logger is now an excellent way for
   trace logging of fielded production drivers.  A number of OpenSS7
   drivers have already been converted to use this facility.

 - Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).

 - Support build on Ubuntu 7.04.

 - Significant rework of the Stream head and both enabling and
   backenabling utilities.  Handling of enabling flags QWANTR and QWANTW
   were not being performed quite properly.  Also, service procedures
   for the read side stream head queue was added to defer wakeups when
   possible.  The result is very significant performance improvements
   (like it wasn't fast enough already).

   STREAMS-based pipes in this package now perform 2 to 5 times (yes
   %200 to %500) faster than the old legacy 4.1BSD/SVR4 Linux pipes
   currently in the kernel: perhaps we should shout the "Fast" too.

   The impact of these performance changes is that Linux Fast-STREAMS
   now runs faster and looser on SMP systems: if your drivers have race
   conditions they will likely be exacerbated by this version.

 - Corrected a few bugs.  See BUGS in the release for more information.

 - Significant rework of STREAMS syncrhonization.  OSF/1-Mentat style
   syncrhonization levels, Solaris style perimeters, and SVR 4.2 style
   load refusal are fully supported.  Some idiosynchracies of AIX,
   HP-UX, MacOT and VxWorks is also supported.

 - Updated to gettext 0.16.1.

 - Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 and 2.6.20-1.2933.fc6
   kernel.

 - Supports build on Fedora Core 6.

 - Support for recent distributions and tool chains.

This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.
