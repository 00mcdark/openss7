streams-0.7a.5 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

Linux Fast-STREAMS is a complete reimplementation of SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS
for Linux, intended as a high-performance production replacement for the
failing and deprecated LiS.

This is the second fully functioning OpenSS7 Project public release of
Linux Fast-STREAMS, the high-performance reimplementation of SVR 4.2 MP
STREAMS for Linux.  This release is a beta release and has been
extensively tested and is mostly stable.  The purpose of the release is
to provide the community with the ability to try the code and
documentation.  Later releases will include any fixes or missing
functionality.

This release has been performance tested (see the results at
<http://www.openss7.org/streams_perf.html>) and conformance tested (see
the results at <http://www.openss7.org/streams_pics.html>) and tested in
comparison with LiS.   Linux Fast-STREAMS far exceeds LiS in every
dimension.  Linux Fast-STREAMS is upt to seven (7) times faster, one
eighth (1/8) the size, and conforms far better to POSIX/SUSv3 standards.
Linux Fast-STREAMS is already more stable that LiS on 64-bit, SMP
kernels, and SMP platforms, and does not lock up on UP kernel where LiS
does.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).  It
includes:

 - Changes to wait queues.  Split single wait queue into four
   independent wait queues.  Reworked wait queues for both old style
   (2.4) and new style (2.6) semantics.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.  Build and run tested on FC4 i686 and x86_64 kernels
   based on 2.6.15.

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
   N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

 This is a public beta test release of the package: it deprecates
 previous releases.  Please upgrade before reporting bugs on previous
 releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the streams package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/streams_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/streams-0.7a.5/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/streams-0.7a.5/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the STREAMS.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/STREAMS_manual.html>).

streams-0.9.2.1 was release under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

The OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS package is a High-Performance STREAMS
framework for Linux that is compatible with SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS and a
host of other commercial UNIX(R) STREAMS implementations, with complete
debugging and production release capabilities.  It is as a
high-performance, production replacement for the buggy and now
deprecated Linux STREAMS (LiS).

The Linux Fast-STREAMS package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and
development environment for the development and execution of STREAMS
modules and drivers under Linux Fast-STREAMS.  It is completely
documented with over four hundred (435) manual pages, and three (3)
major print set manuals.

This release is applicable to Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernels and was targeted
at ix86, x86_64, ppc and ppc64 architectures, but should build and
install for other architectures as well.  The package configures,
compiles, installs and builds rpms or debs for a wide range of Linux
rpm(1)- or dpkg(1)-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching, recompiling or tainting the kernel.  Its small
run-time footprint makes the release suitable for embedded targets.

This is the tenth OpenSS7 Project release of Linux Fast-STREAMS.  This
release is a stable, production grade release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and
is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).  It deprecates
previous releases.  Please upgrade before reporting bugs on previous
releases.

This release is primarily a maintenance release.  No significant defect
corrections or development have been applied.  This release is a stable
production grade release of Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is
deprecated by this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Testing of, and a few bug corrections to, the strlog() feature.
     Trace and error logging working well.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - The package now builds a replacement libLiS and libpLiS library so
     that user applications written to work with LiS-2.18.1 through
     LiS-2.18.4 do no need to be recompiled.  Added versioning of all
     library symbols in all three libraries.

   - Minor bug fixes to STREAMS library.  isastream(3) and fattach(3)
     must not contain an asynchronous thread cancellation point, but
     they could.  Added asynchronous thread cancellation protection to
     these functions to remove any thread cancellation points.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them
     against 64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck'
     target will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Updated `init' scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.
     `streams' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: `LiS' cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the streams package page at
