streams-0.7a.5 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

Linux Fast-STREAMS is a complete reimplementation of SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS
for Linux, intended as a high-performance production replacement for the
failing and deprecated LiS.

This is the second fully functioning OpenSS7 Project public release of
Linux Fast-STREAMS, the high-performance reimplementation of SVR 4.2 MP
STREAMS for Linux.  This release is a beta release and has been
extensively tested and is mostly stable.  The purpose of the release is
to provide the community with the ability to try the code and
documentation.  Later releases will include any fixes or missing
functionality.

This release has been performance tested (see the results at
<http://www.openss7.org/streams_perf.html>) and conformance tested (see
the results at <http://www.openss7.org/streams_pics.html>) and tested in
comparison with LiS.   Linux Fast-STREAMS far exceeds LiS in every
dimension.  Linux Fast-STREAMS is upt to seven (7) times faster, one
eighth (1/8) the size, and conforms far better to POSIX/SUSv3 standards.
Linux Fast-STREAMS is already more stable that LiS on 64-bit, SMP
kernels, and SMP platforms, and does not lock up on UP kernel where LiS
does.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).  It
includes:

 - Changes to wait queues.  Split single wait queue into four
   independent wait queues.  Reworked wait queues for both old style
   (2.4) and new style (2.6) semantics.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.  Build and run tested on FC4 i686 and x86_64 kernels
   based on 2.6.15.

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
   N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

 This is a public beta test release of the package: it deprecates
 previous releases.  Please upgrade before reporting bugs on previous
 releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the streams package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/streams_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/streams-0.7a.5/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/streams-0.7a.5/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the STREAMS.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/STREAMS_manual.html>).
