Package strss7-0.9a.5 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package includes a wide array of kernel modules,
SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs,
daemons, and development environment for the development and execution
of Signalling System Number 7 (SS7), Signalling Transport (SIGTRAN),
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Voice over IP (VoIP)
protocol stack components and applications for the Linux Fast-STREAMS
environment.

However, the current package has had ISDN components moved to the
`strisdn' package, SIGTRAN components moved to the `sigtran' package,
and VoIP components moved to the `strvoip' package.  Only SS7 components
remain in the `strss7' package.

The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package contains a wide array of SS7, SIGTRAN,
ISDN and VoIP drivers and components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  This is
the public release package which has most of the components removed.
Subscribers and sponsors of the OpenSS7 Project have access to the full
array of components.

This is the fifth release of the OpenSS7 SS7 Stack strss7 package that
contains SS7 (Signalling System No. 7), SIGTRAN (SIGnalling TRANsport),
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and VoIP (Void over Internet
Protocol) signalling stack components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The
package contains the necessary header files, manual pages and other
documentation for SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP components in a separate
autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support recent compilers, kernels and
distributions, and to upgrade the X400P-SS7 driver with support for the
Varion V401P (Tormenta III) cards.  Also, this is the first release that
has ISDN, SIGTRAN and VoIP components moved to separate packages (but
will still build all components).

   - The X400P-SS7 driver has been upgraded to support the Varion V401P
     (Tormenta III) card.  This driver passes all validation test suites
     and is production grade.  The driver still supports the older
     cards.  Also, an autoconf style validation test suite was added and
     the `test-x400p' test case executable upgraded.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

_This is a public beta release of the package: it deprecates previous
releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before reporting bugs.
Please see README-alpha in the release, or `Maturity', in the manual._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strss7 package page (http://www.openss7.org/strss7_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strss7-0.9a.5/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strss7-0.9a.5/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `strss7.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/strss7_manual.html).

Package strss7-0.9a.6 was released under GPLv2 2007-03-15.

The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package includes a wide array of kernel modules,
SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs,
daemons, and development environment for the development and execution
of Signalling System Number 7 (SS7), Signalling Transport (SIGTRAN),
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Voice over IP (VoIP)
protocol stack components and applications for the Linux Fast-STREAMS
environment.

However, the current package has had ISDN components moved to the
strisdn package, SIGTRAN components moved to the sigtran package, and
VoIP components moved to the strvoip package.  Only SS7 components
remain in the strss7 package.

The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package contains a wide array of SS7 drivers and
components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  This is the public release package
which has most of the components removed.  Subscribers and sponsors of
the OpenSS7 Project have access to the full array of components.

This is the sixth release of the OpenSS7 SS7 Stack strss7 package that
contains SS7 (Signalling System No.  7) signalling stack components for
Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The package contains the necessary header files,
manual pages and other documentation for SS7 components in a separate
autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support recent compilers, kernels and
distributions.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

 - Corrected support for the DS2152/21352/21552/2154/21352/21555 chips
   present in older V400P cards.  (See BUGS in the release for more
   information.)

 - Support for the DS2156 chip present in recent V401PE cards.  (See
   BUGS in the release for more information.)

 - Corrections for timer bugs in the X400P-SS7 driver.  (See BUGS in the
   release for more information.)

 - Improvements to the common build environment with better support for
   standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

 - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

 - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kernels.

 - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as
   unpacked by separate tarball.

This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strss7 package page (http://www.openss7.org/strss7_pkg.html).
