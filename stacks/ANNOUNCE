strss7-0.9a.4 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

The STREAMS SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP package contains a wide array of SS7,
SIGTRAN, ISDN and VoIP drivers and components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.
This is the public release package which has most of the components
removed.  Subscriber and sponsors of the OpenSS7 Project have access to
the full array of components.

This is the fourth release of the OpenSS7 SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP strss7
package that contains SS7 (Signalling System No. 7), SIGTRAN (SIGnalling
TRANsport), ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and VoIP (Voice
over Internet Protocol) signalling stack components for Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  The package contains the necessary header files, manual
pages and other documentation for SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP components in a
separate autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

 - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support
   32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary
   compatibility should not have been disrupted.  At the same time as
   the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of the IO
   controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
   N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

 This is a public alpha release of the package.
 
 Please see README-alpha in the release, or
 <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strss7-0.9a.4/README-alpha>.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strss7 package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strss7_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary

strss7-0.9a.5 was released under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package includes a wide array of kernel modules,
SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs,
daemons, and development environment for the development and execution
of Signalling System Number 7 (SS7), Signalling Transport (SIGTRAN),
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Voice over IP (VoIP)
protocol stack components and applications for the Linux Fast-STREAMS
environment.

However, the current package has had ISDN components moved to the
`strisdn' package, SIGTRAN components moved to the `sigtran' package,
and VoIP components moved to the `strvoip' package.  Only SS7 components
remain in the `strss7' package.

The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package contains a wide array of SS7, SIGTRAN,
ISDN and VoIP drivers and components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  This is
the public release package which has most of the components removed.
Subscribers and sponsors of the OpenSS7 Project have access to the full
array of components.

This is the fifth release of the OpenSS7 SS7 Stack strss7 package that
contains SS7 (Signalling System No. 7), SIGTRAN (SIGnalling TRANsport),
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and VoIP (Void over Internet
Protocol) signalling stack components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The
package contains the necessary header files, manual pages and other
documentation for SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP components in a separate
autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support recent compilers, kernels and
distributions, and to upgrade the X400P-SS7 driver with support for the
Varion V401P (Tormenta III) cards.  Also, this is the first release that
has ISDN, SIGTRAN and VoIP components moved to separate packages (but
will still build all components).

   - The X400P-SS7 driver has been upgraded to support the Varion V401P
     (Tormenta III) card.  This driver passes all validation test suites
     and is production grade.  The driver still supports the older
     cards.  Also, an `autoconf' style validation test suite was added
     and the `test-x400p' test case executable upgraded.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new --with-optimize option
     to configure to accomplish this.

   - Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   - Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

 This is a public alpha release of the package.
