OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9a.6 of the OpenSS7 SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP <em>strss7</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package includes a wide array of kernel modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers,
modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the
development and execution of Signalling System Number 7 (SS7), Signalling Transport (SIGTRAN),
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Voice over IP (VoIP) protocol stack components and
applications for the Linux Fast-STREAMS environment.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
However, the current package has had ISDN components moved to the <tt>strisdn</tt> package, SIGTRAN
components moved to the <tt>sigtran</tt> package, and VoIP components moved to the <tt>strvoip</tt>
package.  Only SS7 components remain in the <tt>strss7</tt> package.

for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
