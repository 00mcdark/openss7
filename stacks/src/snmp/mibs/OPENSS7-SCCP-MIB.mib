	"This is a list of network references signalling point codes

	 SS7 newtork (point code numbering space) to which the point 
	 code belongs as well as the point code within the network.  The 
	 list is composed of a integral multiple of 4 octets.  Of each 4 
	 octet sequence, the first octet is a network identifier which 
	 identifies the larger national or international SS7 network; 
	 the second octet is the 'network' portion of the signalling 
	 point code as defined in Q.704; the third, the 'cluster'; and, 
	 the fourth and last in each set, the 'member'.  Multiple 
	 network referenced point codes are listed in sequential groups 
	 of 4 octets, where the first 4 octets represent the first point 
	 code and the next four octets represent the next point code, 
	 and so on.  This list is display with a colon separating the 
	 network number and the normal numbers and dashes notation for 
	 the signalling point code, with grouping separated by commas: 
	 e.g. 1:5-1-1,1:5-1-2,1:5-1-3.  Note that an ITU-T signalling 
	 point code is unpacked by network, cluster and member into 
	 separate octets.  Also not that hwen the first octet of each 4 
	 octet grouping is zero (0) it does not specify a larger 
	 national or International network and thus the network point 
	 code applies only to a locally defined network."
