         MTP GDMOs."

SlsList ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "1d,"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This is a way of specifying a list of SLS values.  Because SLS 
         values can be 4, 5 or 8 bits, depending on the protocol 
         variant, issue year,  and options, one octet is used to 
         represent one SLS value.  If 4 bit SLSs apply, each octet is 
         set to a value constrained to the range (0..15) and the size of 
         the string is constrained to SIZE(0..16); 5-bits, (0..31), 
         SIZE(0..32); and 8-bits (0..255), SIZE(0..256).  No SLS value 
         can be repeated in the list.  What we really want is a SET OF 
         Sls here, but SNMP won't have it."

    DESCRIPTION

SpType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual covention describes the type of signalling point.  
         One of the of the major reasons for understanding this 
         information is so that the MTP Restart procedures can be 
         properly performed against an adjacent signalling point.  When 
         sep(0), it indicates that the signalling point is a signalling 
         end point that is not equipped with the transfer function; when 
         step (1), it indicates that the signalling point is both a 
         signalling end point (it has user parts) and a signalling 
         transfer point (it has the transfer function); or, stp(2), the 
         signalling point is has the transfer function but does not have 
         user parts."

NetworkPointCode ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "1d:1d-"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
	"This is a network referenced signalling point code that 
	 uniquely identifies both the national or international SS7 
	 network (point code numbering space) to which the point code 
	 belongs as well as the point code within the network.  The 
	 first octet is a network identifier that identifies the larger 
	 national or international SS7 network; the second octet is the 
	 'network' portion of the signalling point code as defined in 
	 Q.704; the third, the 'cluster'; and, the fourth and last, the 
	 'member'.  This is displayed with a colon separating the 
	 network number and the normal numbers and dashes notation for 
	 the signalling point code: e.g. 1:5-1-1.  Note that an ITU-T 
	 signalling point code is unpacked by network, cluster and 
	 member into separate octets.  Also note that when the first 
	 octet is zero (0) it does not specify a global larger network 
	 and thus the network point code applies only to a locally 
	 defined network."
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING (SIZE(4))

MtpLinkFailureReason ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This is the detailed reason for a link failure.  It has the 
         following enumeration: unspecified(0), the reason for failure 
         is unknown or none of the other failure reasons apply;

MtpUserPartStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention can be used for reporting the 
         availability of MTP user parts as well as providing a mechanism 
         for controlling the availability of user parts.  unknown(0) 
         means that the availabilty of the user part is unknown; 
         inaccessible(1) means that the user part is present but 
         currently inaccessible; unequipped(2) means that the user part 
         is not present."
    SYNTAX      INTEGER { unknown(0), inaccessible(1), unequipeed(2) }

MtpUserPart ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention provides an enumerated user part value 
         that corresponds to the MTP SI value for the user part.  SI 
         values snmm(0), sntm(1) and snsm(2) are reserved for MTP 
         management messages; other values may be assigned to user

Ss7ProtocolVariant ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convetion provides the SS7 protocol variant as an 
         object identifier.  The object identifiers used as a value for 
         this convention must be defined with an OBJECT-IDENTITY macro 
         definition.  The DESCRIPTION of the definition should identify 
         that the the object identifier is intended for use with this 
         textual convention.  The OPENSS7-SS7-MIB defines a number of 
         object for identifying ITU-T, ETSI, ANSI, JTTC and PNOC that 
         may be used; however, any object identity that is known to the 
         agent may be used, including private protocol definitions 
         within enterprise MIBS."
