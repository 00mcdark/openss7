    DESCRIPTION
	"This is a MIB providing management information is accordance 
	 with ITU-T Rec. Q.751.1, ITU-T Rec.  Q.2751.1, ANSI T1.116.1.
	 
	 Notes:
	 
	  1. ITU-T Rec. Q.751.1 (1997) and ANSI T1.116.1 (2000) derive 
	     and contain managed objects against ITU-T Rec. M.3100 
	     managed objects.  This is largely a matter of alarms and 
	     performance measures.  This MIB assumes that the 
	     capabilities provided by ITU-T Rec. M.3100 are provided by 
	     an intermediate manager.  That is, alarm aggregation and 
	     summary, and performance measure analysis.  Therefore, 
	     there is no managedSwitchingElement MOC represented in this 
	     MIB.  The managedElementId to which alarms and measures 
	     correspond are implied by the SNMP host and community 
	     string.
	 
	  2. ITU-T Rec. Q.751.1 (1997) and ANSI T.116.1 (2000) do not 
	     provide a management model that accomodates having multiple 
	     protocol stack variants running on the same managed 
	     switching element under multiple network appearances, such 
	     as the international gateway SSP or STP illustrated in 
	     ITU-T Rec. Q.705 and ANSI T1.111.5.  This MIB adds a 
	     network appearance managed object class to accomodate that.
	 
	  3. ITU-T Rec. Q.2751.1 provides add-on support for MTP3b SAAL.  
	     The corresponding managed objects have been included in 
	     this MIB.
	 
	  4. ITU-T Rec. Q.751.1 Annex E and ITU-T Rec. ANSI T1.116.1 
	     Appendix D provide performance measurements in accordance 
	     with ITU-T Rec. Q.752 and ANSI T1.116.2.  However, the 
	     model of the performance measures are not ammeniable to 
	     SNMP and have been regrouped and simplified.
	 
	  5. ITU-T Rec. Q.752 and ANSI T1.116.2 only require a 5-minute 
	     collection interval for near-real-time performance measures 
	     and a 30-minute collection interval for longer term 
	     performance measures.  Nevertheless, it states that the 
	     objective is for 15-minute intervals for longer term 
	     performance measures.  Since these specifications are quite 
	     old and most systems are easily capable of 15-minute 
	     collection intervals, all 5-minute and 30-minute measures 
	     have been converted to 5-minute or 15-minute measures.
	 
	  6. The gateway screening provided in ITU-T Rec. Q.705 and ANSI 
	     T1.111.5 Clause 8 is a very simplified approach.  Three 
	     advances in the industry have occurred since then: enhanced 
	     gateway screening, border gateway screening, and full 
	     mediation.  Also, at the time that SS7 was developed, 
	     platforms were not very capable in this regard: current 
	     implemetnations should be able to perform a full access 
	     control list rule set on all message attributes.  This MIB 
	     has been updated to accomodate.
	 
	  7. Q.751.1, Q.2751.1 and ANSI T1.116.1 do not provide for RFC 
	     4165 M2PA (SIGTRAN) signalling links.  This MIB provides 
	     additional MOC definitions for signalling links that rely 
	     on M2PA to provide the underlying signalling link.  An 
	     attempt was made to do this consistent with the approach of 
	     Q.2751.1.
	 
	  8. Q.751.1 and T1.116.1 do not provide for Q.703 Annex A or 
	     ANSI T1.111.3 Appendix A operation (so-called high-speed 
	     signalling links at full T1 and E1 rates).  This MIB was 
	     enhanced to provide for Q.703 Annex A signalling links.
	 
	  9. Q.751.1 does not provide for management of many of the 
	     optional features found in Q.704 and ANSI T1.111.4.  Also, 
	     ANSI T1.116.1 does not provide management of timers 
	     specific to ANSI!  Additional attributes were added to 
	     managed object classes to accomodate this.

    DESCRIPTION
	"Provides a treatment result for rules in the gateway screening 
	 tables.  Objects with a SYNTAX clause containing this textual 
	 convention are single-valued and may have one of the following 
	 values:
	 
	  - normal(0), the message will be processed as normal.
	 
	  - discard(1), the message will be discarded with no further 
	    action.
	 
	  - prohibit(2), the message will be treated as a message to a 
	    prohibited destination: that is, the message will illicit a 
	    transfer-prohibited response for the destination point code 
	    in the message and then the message is discarded.
	 
	  - unequipped(3), when the message has an SI value that 
	    corresponds to an MTP user part, the message will be treated 
	    as a message to an unequipped user: that is, the message 
	    will illicit a user-part-unavailable message for an 
	    unequipped user and then the message is discarded.
	 
	  - inaccessible(4), when the message has an SI value that 
	    corresponds to an MTP user part, the message will be treated 
	    as a message to an inaccessible user: that is, the message 
	    will illicit a user-part-unavailable message for an 
	    inaccessible user and then the message is discarded.
	 
	  - congest(5), the message will be treated as a message to a 
	    congested destination: that is, the message will illicit a 
	    transfer-controlled response for the destination point code 
	    and at the priority of the message and then the message is 
	    discarded.

	 Note that application of values other than normal(0) or 
	 discard(1) will not conform to ITU-T Recommendation Q.705 
	 Clause 8.

	 When a signalling link failure occurs, an ss7OnOccEvent

	 which indicates the reason for the failure, as follows:
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to receipt of an 
	    abnormal FIB or BSN, the abnormalFIBRorBSNR object identity 
	    will be placed in the specific problem.  In this case the 
	    notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure 
	    - All reasons) and 1.3 (SL failure - Abnormal FIBR/BSNR) on 
	      occurrence notifiction.
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to excessive delay of 
	    acknowledgement, or T7 timeout, the excessiveAckDelay object 
	    identity will be placed in the specific problem.  In this 
	    case the notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL 
	    failure - All reasons) and 1.4 (SL failure - Excessive delay 
	    of ack) on occurence notification.
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to excessive error rate, 
	    or the error count surpassing the threshold in the SUERM or 
	    EIM, the excessiveErrorRate object identity will be placed 
	    in the specific problem.  In this case the notification 
	    corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure - All 
	    reasons) and 1.5 (SL failure - Excessive error rate) on 
	    ocurence notification.
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to excessive duration of 
	    congestion (i.e, Timer T6 expiry), the excessiveCongDuration 
	    object identity will be placed in the specific problem.  In 
	    this case the notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 
	    1.2 (SL failure - All reasons) and 1.6 (SL failure - 
	      Excessive duration of congestion) on occurrence 
	      notification.
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to a reason other than 
	    the above, or the reason cannot be determined, no object 
	    identity is placed in the specific problems.  In this case, 
	    the notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL 
	    failure - All reasons) on occurence notification.
	 
	  - When the signalling link is restored (versus intialized) 
	    this proabable cause with the perceived severity of 
	    cleared(5) will be issued complete with the objectPointer 
	    identifying the restored link.  In this case the 
	    notification corresponds to Table 1/Q.752 1.12 (SL 
	    restoration).
	 
	 For signalling link failures, the perceivedSeverity included in 
	 the message is warning(1), minor(2), major(3) or critical(4).  
	 The failure of a signalling link is considered a minor alarm 
	 event.  If the loss of the signalling link results in the 
	 failure of a link set, or other failures such as route set 
	 failures, a separate major(3) alarm will be generated for the 
	 correlated failure.  Additional information that must be placed 
	 in the alarm assertion is the objectPointer of the signalling 
	 link in question."

    DESCRIPTION
	"A signalling point is a node in the signalling network.  It is 
	 part of a managed switching element (exchange).  The MTP 
	 permits three types of node:
	 
	 SEP: the signalling end point, this type of SP contains MTP and 
	 ISUP (and or other MTP Users), but cannot act as an 
	 intermediate MTP transfer node in the SS No.7 network.  (It can 
	 act as an SCCP Relay Node.)
	 
	 STP: the MTP signalling transfer point, this type of SP acts as 
	 an intermediate node between SEPs to transfer messages through 
	 the SS No.7-network, it only contains MTP.  (In case of an STP, 
	 OMAP, and hence also TC and SCCP may be present.)
	 
	 STEP: MTP signalling transfer and end point, the type combines 
	 the previous mentioned types, thus acting both as a SEP and as 
	 a STP.
	 
	 A mtpSignPoint can have the MTP status:
	 
	 allowed, this means that the mtpSignPoint is accessible and is 
	 functioning normally (operational state = enabled, availability 
	 status = '')
	 
	 congested, this means that the mtpSignPoint is accessible but 
	 is heavily loaded (operational state = enabled, availability 
	 status = {degraded})
	 
	 prohibited, this means that the mtpSignPoint not accessible 
	 (operational state = disabled).
	 
	 During MTP restart, the proceduralStatus is {initializing} 
	 until the restart is finished."

	"This attribute defines the initial timer value of timer T34 
	 (ANSI) link oscillation suspension timer (Procedure B) defined 
	 in ANSI T1.111.4 (2000) 12.2.2.  The value range is from 5 to

	 This timer value and procedure is in effect whenever the 
	 signalling link is set to use link oscillation procedure B.  
	 For link oscillation procedure A, see mtpSignPointMtpT32A.  For 
	 link oscillation using ITU-T procedures see mtpSignPointMtpT17.
	 
	 ANSI T1.111.4 (1996 and 2000) 12.2.2 ...  In order to [sic] 
	 prevent links from oscillating rapidly between the in-service 
	 and out-of-service states, a link oscillation filtering 
	 procedure shall be provided.  This procedure is applicable in 
	 all cases where automatic restoration and removal of signalling 
	 links to and from service is used.  The procedure is not 
	 invoked if restoration to or removal from service is initiated 
	 manually.
	 
	 Link oscillation filtering is a local procedure.  One of the 
	 following procedures, A or B, is used.
	 
	 (B) When activation or restoration of a signalling link has 
	 been completed, it is put on probation for a period controlled 
	 by timer T33 which starts running when the link enters the 
	 in-service state and is stopped either on time-out or on link 
	 failure.
	 
	 If a link fails during the probation, i.e. before expiration of 
	 timer T33, it is put on suspension.  While suspended the link 
	 remains in the out-of-service state at level 2, restoration 
	 procedures to bring the link back into alignment are not 
	 invoked and realignment attempts initiated by the remote end 
	 are ignored.
	 
	 The suspension time period is controlled by timer T34 which 
	 starts running when the link enters the out-of-service state.  
	 Link restoration is resumed, on expiry of timer T34.
	 
	 The values chosen in a given network node for the probation and 
	 suspension time periods are dependent on the type and function 
	 of the node in the network and may be modified by management

    DESCRIPTION
	"A Signalling Route Set is a complete set of routes that can be 
	 used to carry traffic toward a specific destination signalling 
	 point.  The signRouteSetNePart Managed Object class defines the 
	 management capabilities of the resources which represent a 
	 specific destination SP and its accessibility as seen from the 
	 own SP.  This SP may be the originating SP of the MTP messages 
	 or an STP.  A particular signRouteSetNePart may be related to 
	 one or more Signalling Route Sets on network level.
	 
	 The administrativeState attribute describes whether it is 
	 administratively permitted to route SS No. 7 MSUs towards the 
	 respective destination point.  Before the administrative state 
	 of a signRouteSetNePart can be set to 'unlocked', there must be 
	 at least one signRouteNePart contained within the 
	 signRouteSetNePart.
	 
	 The operationalState attribute describes whether the respective 
	 destination signalling point is accessible - ('enabled') or not 
	 ('disabled').  If the operational states of all signRouteNePart 
	 instances contained in the signRouteSetNePart are 'disabled', 
	 then the operational state of the signRouteSetNePart is 
	 'disabled', in any other case it is 'enabled'.
	 
	 The usageState attribute is used to reflect route set 
	 congestion.  The value is 'busy' in case of route set 
	 congestion.
	 
	 If the 'ITU-T Rec. X.721 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10165-2: 
	 1992':communicationsAlarm notification is present, it indicates 
	 at least the following probable causes:
	 
	 Probable Cause = 411(RouteSetUnavailable), which represents 
	 measurements Q.752/4.11 (PerceivedSeverity=Maj/Min/War) and 
	 Q.751/4.12 (PerceivedSeverity=Cleared).
	 
	 If the ss7OnOccEventPackage is present, event notifications 
	 with the following probable cause can apply:
	 
	 Probable Cause = 002 (remoteUserPartUnavailable), with the 
	 involved user part as parameter.  Possible values for 
	 SpecificProblems are: 007 'unknown', 008 'unequipped' and 009 
	 'inaccessibleRemoteUser'.
	 
	 An activation or deactivation of a signRouteSetNePart must lead 
	 to the activation respectively deactivation of all contained 
	 signRouteNeParts."

mtpRtTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF MtpRtEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
	"A signalling route (A,C,B)i is defined as an ordered sequence 
	 of the near end signalling point A (i.e. the network element), 
	 an adjacent SP C and the destination SP B.  The adjacent SP C 
	 may be identical with the destination B, or it may or may not 
	 be directly interconnected to the destination SP.  The adjacent 
	 SP C must be directly connected to the near end SP by at least 
	 one linkset which is intended to convey MSUs sent from A to B 
	 (hence the use of the term 'adjacent').
	 
	 Two signalling routes (A,C,B)i and (A,C,B)j are distinct if the 
	 adjacent SP is different.
	 
	 The signRouteNePart Managed Object class defines the management 
	 capabilities of the resources which define a specific route 
	 segment (Link Set to be traversed) and its priority within the 
	 routeset as seen from the own SP.  A particular signRouteNePart 
	 is related to one or more Signalling Routes on the network 
	 level.
	 
	 The priority in which the network Signalling Routes are used, 
	 is defined by means of assigning priorities to all involved 
	 route segments.  If from a particular SP two or more route 
	 segments are used with the same priority, loadsharing between 
	 Signalling Routes may occur.
	 
	 A Combined Link Set is a set of Link Sets used with the same 
	 priority by message routing.
	 
	 The signLinkSetTp used for routing is allocated at creation 
	 time and cannot be changed during the existence of a particular 
	 signRouteNePart.
	 
	 The administrativeState attribute describes whether it is 
	 administratively permitted to route messages towards the 
	 respective destination point via the referenced signLinkSetTp.
	 
	 The operationalState attribute is 'enabled' if both the 
	 referenced signLinkSetTp is in the operational state 'enabled' 
	 and no TFP message concerning the respective destination has 
	 been received from the adjPC of the respective signLinkSetTp.
	 
	 The optional usageState attribute is used to cover restriction 
	 of a route.  Its value is set to 'busy', if the route is 
	 restricted ('transfer restricted' is a national option).
	 
	 The availabilityStatus attribute gives additional information 
	 about the availability of the signRouteNePart instance.  It is 
	 furthermore needed to map some of the MTP functional states 
	 (prohibited: availabilityStatus = {dependency}, restricted: 
	 availabilityStatus={degraded}) and is used for the case that 
	 the route is locked not by the OS, but e.g. by a local 
	 administrator (administrativeState=unlocked and 
	 availabilityStatus={off line})."

    SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF MtpLsEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
	"This managed object class represents the SS No. 7 signalling 
	 link set termination point.  Link sets are defined in 
	 Recommendation Q.704.  The states are directly related to the 
	 set of link termination point's states, except for the optional 
	 administrativeState.
	 
	 General principles on state information:
	 
	 The states of the managed object linkset are only readable, 
	 except for the optional administrativeState.
	 
	 Activation and deactivation of a linkset may be done via 
	 operations on the links (e.g. by using scoping functions) or 
	 the optional administrativeState can be used for this.
	 
	 Based on these principles the states of a linkset are defined 
	 as follows:
	 
	 operational state (read-only for the OS).  The operational 
	 state is enabled whenever one link of the linkset is enabled, 
	 i.e.  neither FAILED nor DEACTIVATED nor LOCAL BLOCKED nor 
	 REMOTE BLOCKED.
	 
	 Usage state (read-only for the OS).  The usage state reflects 
	 the usage of the belonging links.  It is ACTIVE if at least one 
	 of the belonging links is ACTIVE and no link is BUSY.  It 
	 contains BUSY if one of the belonging links is BUSY.  It is 
	 IDLE if all links are UNAVAILABLE.
	 
	 Availability status (read-only for the OS).  The availability 
	 status indicates unavailability or reduced availability of the 
	 belonging links.  It contains DEPENDENCY if all the belonging 
	 links are unavailable for user traffic.  It contains DEGRADED 
	 if at least one belonging link is not available for user 
	 traffic.  For the different reasons of unavailability (failed, 
	 deactivated, local blocked, remote blocked, local inhibited and 
	 remote inhibited) see 3.2.1/Q.704.
	 
	 If the 'ITU-T Rec. X.721 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10165-2 : 
	 1992':communicationsAlarm notification is used, the following 
	 probable causes can apply:

	 measurements Q.752/4.3 (PerceivedSeverity=Maj/Min/War) and 
	 Q.752/4.4 (PerceivedSeverity=Cleared).
	 
	 State change notifications are emitted for all state and status

	 enabled: the link termination point is operationally able to 
	 transport user part traffic or test traffic.
	 
	 disabled: the link termination point is operationally unable to 
	 transport user part traffic or test traffic.  The operational 
	 state is disabled whenever the link termination point status

	 'active': the link termination point is not congested.  
	 Currently the link termination point carries user part traffic.
	 
	 busy: the link termination point is congested due to user part 
	 traffic.  The usage state is idle whenever the link termination 
	 point status is not empty i.e.  the usage state immediately 
	 reflects the availability of the signLinkTp for user traffic.

	 In general this value determines the amount of time that it

	 association which has no data to transmit or retransmit.  M2PA, 
	 however, is used by MTP Level 3 which generates a test message

	 ANSI T1.111.7 (2000) to have a range from 4 to 12 seconds.  
	 Therefore, for M2PA, unless the SCTP heartbeat interval is set 
	 below Q.707-T2, it will only have effect on multihomed 
	 associations for checking the status of non-primary or non-CMT 
	 destinations.
	 
	 Reducing this value will reduce the amount of time taken to 
	 detect primary and non-primary, non-CMT path, interface and 
	 destination failures, but may only affect primary destinations 
	 if reduced below the coresponding Q.707-T2 value.

-- Most of the notifications defined here are for reporting first and

-- communications alarms.

-- Notification objects (scalars) for use in notifications.

-- The TMN (Q.751.1) way of providing on-occurrence events from Q.752 
-- notifications is to provide a special ss7OnOccEvent notification 
-- which performs double duty as a communicationsAlarm (that is, it 
-- contains the same information as a communications alarm).  That 
-- approach is duplicated here to limit the number of unique 
-- notifications necessary to represent all of the events to one, which 
-- also provides alarms.

	"This managed object class represents the SS No. 7 signalling 
	 link set termination point.  Link sets are defined in 
	 Recommendation Q.704.  The states are directly related to the 
	 set of link termination point's states, except for the optional 
	 administrativeState.
	 
	 General principles on state information:
	 
	 The states of the managed object linkset are only readable, 
	 except for the optional administrativeState.
	 
	 Activation and deactivation of a linkset may be done via 
	 operations on the links (e.g. by using scoping functions) or 
	 the optional administrativeState can be used for this.
	 
	 Based on these principles the states of a linkset are defined 
	 as follows:
	 
	 operational state (read-only for the OS).  The operational 
	 state is enabled whenever one link of the linkset is enabled, 
	 i.e.  neither FAILED nor DEACTIVATED nor LOCAL BLOCKED nor 
	 REMOTE BLOCKED.
	 
	 Usage state (read-only for the OS).  The usage state reflects 
	 the usage of the belonging links.  It is ACTIVE if at least one 
	 of the belonging links is ACTIVE and no link is BUSY.  It 
	 contains BUSY if one of the belonging links is BUSY.  It is 
	 IDLE if all links are UNAVAILABLE.
	 
	 Availability status (read-only for the OS).  The availability 
	 status indicates unavailability or reduced availability of the 
	 belonging links.  It contains DEPENDENCY if all the belonging 
	 links are unavailable for user traffic.  It contains DEGRADED 
	 if at least one belonging link is not available for user 
	 traffic.  For the different reasons of unavailability (failed, 
	 deactivated, local blocked, remote blocked, local inhibited and 
	 remote inhibited) see 3.2.1/Q.704.
	 
	 If the 'ITU-T Rec. X.721 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10165-2 : 
	 1992':communicationsAlarm notification is used, the following 
	 probable causes can apply:
	 
	 Probable Cause=403 (LinkSetFailure), which represents 
	 measurements Q.752/4.3 (PerceivedSeverity=Maj/Min/War) and 
	 Q.752/4.4 (PerceivedSeverity=Cleared).
	 
	 State change notifications are emitted for all state and status 
	 changes."

	 The following state and status attributes are supported:
	 
	 administrative state:
	 
	 locked: it is administratively not permitted to transport 
	 traffic on the link termination point.
	 
	 unlocked: it is administratively permitted to transport user 
	 part traffic or test traffic on the link termination point.
	 
	 operational state:
	 
	 enabled: the link termination point is operationally able to 
	 transport user part traffic or test traffic.
	 
	 disabled: the link termination point is operationally unable to 
	 transport user part traffic or test traffic.  The operational 
	 state is disabled whenever the link termination point status 
	 contains Failed, Deactivated, Local Blocked, Remote Blocked, or 
	 the procedural status is Initializing.
	 
	 usage state:
	 
	 idle: the link termination point carries no user part traffic 
	 (test traffic may be present).
	 
	 'active': the link termination point is not congested.  
	 Currently the link termination point carries user part traffic.
	 
	 busy: the link termination point is congested due to user part 
	 traffic.  The usage state is idle whenever the link termination 
	 point status is not empty i.e.  the usage state immediately 
	 reflects the availability of the signLinkTp for user traffic.
	 
	 For national MTP options applying several congestion levels an 
	 additional attribute indicating these levels may be added.
	 
	 procedural status:
	 
	 The procedural status initializing is valid during initial

	 The procedural status not initalized applies when the link 
	 termination point is not aligned and the initial alignment

	 Link termination point status.  This is a set-valued attribute.  
	 The following statusses can exist alone or in combinations with

	 SP C must be directly connected to the near end SP by at least 
	 one linkset which is intended to convey MSUs sent from A to B 
	 (hence the use of the term 'adjacent').
	 
	 Two signalling routes (A,C,B)i and (A,C,B)j are distinct if the 
	 adjacent SP is different.
	 
	 The signRouteNePart Managed Object class defines the management 
	 capabilities of the resources which define a specific route 
	 segment (Link Set to be traversed) and its priority within the 
	 routeset as seen from the own SP.  A particular signRouteNePart 
	 is related to one or more Signalling Routes on the network 
	 level.
	 
	 The priority in which the network Signalling Routes are used, 
	 is defined by means of assigning priorities to all involved 
	 route segments.  If from a particular SP two or more route 
	 segments are used with the same priority, loadsharing between 
	 Signalling Routes may occur.
	 
	 A Combined Link Set is a set of Link Sets used with the same 
	 priority by message routing.
	 
	 The signLinkSetTp used for routing is allocated at creation 
	 time and cannot be changed during the existence of a particular 
	 signRouteNePart.
	 
	 The administrativeState attribute describes whether it is 
	 administratively permitted to route messages towards the 
	 respective destination point via the referenced signLinkSetTp.
	 
	 The operationalState attribute is 'enabled' if both the 
	 referenced signLinkSetTp is in the operational state 'enabled' 
	 and no TFP message concerning the respective destination has 
	 been received from the adjPC of the respective signLinkSetTp.
	 
	 The optional usageState attribute is used to cover restriction 
	 of a route.  Its value is set to 'busy', if the route is 
	 restricted ('transfer restricted' is a national option).
	 
	 The availabilityStatus attribute gives additional information

	 furthermore needed to map some of the MTP functional states 
	 (prohibited: availabilityStatus = {dependency}, restricted:

	 respective destination point.  Before the administrative state 
	 of a signRouteSetNePart can be set to 'unlocked', there must be 
	 at least one signRouteNePart contained within the 
	 signRouteSetNePart.
	 
	 The operationalState attribute describes whether the respective 
	 destination signalling point is accessible - ('enabled') or not 
	 ('disabled').  If the operational states of all signRouteNePart 
	 instances contained in the signRouteSetNePart are 'disabled', 
	 then the operational state of the signRouteSetNePart is 
	 'disabled', in any other case it is 'enabled'.
	 
	 The usageState attribute is used to reflect route set 
	 congestion.  The value is 'busy' in case of route set 
	 congestion.
	 
	 If the 'ITU-T Rec. X.721 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10165-2:

	 Probable Cause = 411(RouteSetUnavailable), which represents 
	 measurements Q.752/4.11 (PerceivedSeverity=Maj/Min/War) and 
	 Q.751/4.12 (PerceivedSeverity=Cleared).
	 
	 If the ss7OnOccEventPackage is present, event notifications 
	 with the following probable cause can apply:
	 
	 Probable Cause = 002 (remoteUserPartUnavailable), with the 
	 involved user part as parameter.  Possible values for 
	 SpecificProblems are: 007 'unknown', 008 'unequipped' and 009 
	 'inaccessibleRemoteUser'.
	 
	 An activation or deactivation of a signRouteSetNePart must lead 
	 to the activation respectively deactivation of all contained 
	 signRouteNeParts."
