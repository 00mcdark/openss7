    DESCRIPTION
	"The purpose of this MIB is to provide SNMP support for the MTP 
	 operational measurements provided in ITU-T Q.752 and ANSI 
	 T1.116.  There exists a draft GDMO specification for ANSI 
	 T1.116.1 from which this MIB is based.  Strangely enough, no 
	 GDMO is standardized for SS7 operational measurements.

	 The objective of this MIB is to support both the reporting of 
	 statistics obtained from Operational Measurements as well as 
	 providing a mechanism to activate and report the results of OM 
	 studies."

	 The number of MSUs discarded due to signalling link congestion.  
	 The significance and method of measuring this item depends upon

	 three congestion handling methods are:

	 a) single congestion level without priority; or
	 b) national option of multiple levels without message 
	    priorities; or
	 c) the national option of multiple congestion levels with 
	    message priorities.

	 For cases a) and b), messages are discarded by the MTP only 
	 under extreme overload.  Thus the count indicates, if greater 
	 than zero, an extreme congestion.  It indicates the 
	 effectiveness of flow control procedures.  For case c), 
	 messages with priority less thatn the discard level are 
	 discarded in the MTP.  For this case, the MSUs discarded due to 
	 SL congestion (thresholds 1, 2 and 3 separately) are counted 
	 based on the greatest congestion discard threshold in effect on 
	 the link.  For example, if the congestion on a link has 
	 exceeded congestion discard threshold 2, and therefore MSUs 
	 with priority 0 and 1 are being discarded, a MSU discarded with 
	 priority 0 is counted in the threshould 2 count.

	 The number of MSUs discarded due to signalling link congestion.  
	 The significance and method of measuring this item depends upon

	 three congestion handling methods are:

	 a) single congestion level without priority; or
	 b) national option of multiple levels without message 
	    priorities; or
	 c) the national option of multiple congestion levels with 
	    message priorities.

	 For cases a) and b), messages are discarded by the MTP only 
	 under extreme overload.  Thus the count indicates, if greater 
	 than zero, an extreme congestion.  It indicates the 
	 effectiveness of flow control procedures.  For case c), 
	 messages with priority less thatn the discard level are 
	 discarded in the MTP.  For this case, the MSUs discarded due to 
	 SL congestion (thresholds 1, 2 and 3 separately) are counted 
	 based on the greatest congestion discard threshold in effect on 
	 the link.  For example, if the congestion on a link has 
	 exceeded congestion discard threshold 2, and therefore MSUs 
	 with priority 0 and 1 are being discarded, a MSU discarded with 
	 priority 0 is counted in the threshould 2 count.

    DESCRIPTION

	 The number of MSUs discarded due to signalling link congestion.  
	 The significance and method of measuring this item depends upon

	 three congestion handling methods are:

	 a) single congestion level without priority; or
	 b) national option of multiple levels without message 
	    priorities; or
	 c) the national option of multiple congestion levels with 
	    message priorities.

	 For cases a) and b), messages are discarded by the MTP only 
	 under extreme overload.  Thus the count indicates, if greater 
	 than zero, an extreme congestion.  It indicates the 
	 effectiveness of flow control procedures.  For case c), 
	 messages with priority less thatn the discard level are 
	 discarded in the MTP.  For this case, the MSUs discarded due to 
	 SL congestion (thresholds 1, 2 and 3 separately) are counted 
	 based on the greatest congestion discard threshold in effect on 
	 the link.  For example, if the congestion on a link has 
	 exceeded congestion discard threshold 2, and therefore MSUs 
	 with priority 0 and 1 are being discarded, a MSU discarded with 
	 priority 0 is counted in the threshould 2 count.
