    DESCRIPTION
	"The purpose of this MIB is to proivde SNMP support for the SCCP 
	 operational measurements provided in ITU-T Q.752 and ANSI 
	 T1.116.  There exists a draft GDMO specification for ANSI 
	 T1.116.1 from which this MIB is based.  Strangely enough, no 
	 GDMO is standardized for SS7 operational measurements.

	 The objective of this MIB is to support both the reporting of 
	 statistics obtained from Operational Measurements as well as 
	 providing a mechanism to activate and report the results of OM 
	 studies."

    DESCRIPTION
	"Routing failure measurements (items 7.1 through 7.7 and 7.9) 
	 refer to all possible failures (both local and remote) detected 
	 by SCCP Routing Control, and count all SCCP messages that 
	 encounter transport problems, regardless of whether or not an 
	 (X)Unitdata Service message or N-NOTICE primitive is returned 
	 to the originator.  Receipt of a (X)Unitdata Service message is 
	 not included in this count.  All of these measurements are 
	 marked as 'first and interval'.  They enable SCCP routing 
	 failures to be identified.  The measurements are also marked as 
	 '15 minutes' for network dimensioning and reliability studies.

	 The reassembly error measurements (items 7.10 through 7.12) are 
	 prescribed for the SCCP connectionless reassembly service.  
	 Item 7.12 (no reassembly space) indicates a resource limitation 
	 when the first segment of a sequence is received.

	 Item 7.13 (hop counter violation) indicates a routing failure, 
	 possible an SCCP circular route.  All hop counter violations 
	 are reported with this item, including those from Connection 
	 Request (CR) messages.

	 (ANSI) Events are reported per calling party address (if this 
	 is not present in any offending CR message, an 'unknown' value 
	 is indicated), called part address, and MTP label OPC 
	 combinarion.

	 (ITU-T) The report associated with the first event of Items 
	 7.10 and 7.11 should contain at least the calling party address 
	 and segmentation local reference as diagnostic information.  
	 The report associated with the first event of Items 7.13 should 
	 contain as diagnostic information at least the called party 
	 address, and the OPC of the MTP routing label.  If present, the 
	 calling party address should also be included.  The report 
	 associated with the first event of 7.14 should contain as 
	 diagnostic information the subsystem number and called party 
	 address.  The reports associated with the first event of Items 
	 7.15, 7.16, 7.17 and 7.18 should contain as diagnostic 
	 information at least the MTP Service Access Point (SAP) 
	 identity (implementation dependent), the connection references 
	 (local and remote) and the DPC.  Items 7.17 and 7.18 should 
	 also contain the cause.

    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
	"SCCP management messages are included in the totals of items 
	 9.3 through 9.7; they have SSN = 1 and protocol class = 0.

	 SCCP utilization measurements, items 9.3 and 9.4 refer to all 
	 messages processed by SCCP Routing Control, whether or not the 
	 message is processed or delivered successfully.  In Item 9.3 it 
	 is assumed that a message transiting an SCCP relay point is 
	 counted only once.  Item 9.4 is for messages received for local 
	 subsystems. (ITU-T) This includes, for example, RLC messages 
	 received in a relay node for a connection section, CR or 
	 (L)(X)UDT messages received for an unequipped subsystem, etc.  
	 Both items include any internal messages between users in the 
	 same SCCP node.

	 Measurement 9.5 measures the utilization of the translation 
	 function within SCCP Routing Control and is a count of all 
	 messages ([ITU-T] including locally generated (L)(X)UDTS 
	 messages) for which global title translation is attempted.  The 
	 measurement is only applicable at nodes with translation 
	 capabilities.

	 These measurements are measured over 5 minute intervals for 
	 performance analysis and over 15 minute intervals for network 
	 administration and planning.

	 The SCCP Quality of Serivce is estimated by comparing the 
	 number of unsuccessful UDT transfer (Items 9 bis.2 and 9 bis.4) 
	 to the total number of UDT transfer (9 bis.1 and 9 bis.3), the 
	 number of unsuccessful connection establishments (9 bis.6 and 9 
	 bis.8) to the total number of establishment attempts (9 bis.5 
	 and 9 bis.7), the numer of resets and syntax errors detected on 
	 existing signalling connections (9 bis.9 to 9 bis.12) to the 
	 total number of successful connection establishments, and the 
	 number of unsuccessful XUDT transfers (Items 9 bis.14 and 9 
	 bis.16) to the total number of XUDT transfers (9 bis.13 and 9 
	 bis.15), (ITU-T) and the number of successful LUDT transfer (9 
	 bis.17 and 9 bis.19).  (ANSI) The LUDT transfer counts are for 
	 further study.  All of these measurements are taken over 
	 5-minute periods for near real-time monitoring or 15-minute 
	 periods.

	 (ITU-T) It should be noted tat the number of (L)(X)UDTS 
	 messages measured against the number of successful (L)(X)UDT 
	 messages does not directly give the SCCP QoS, since the return 
	 on error option is not always set in (L)(X)UDT messages.  
	 Errors in transmission of segments of long messages might also 
	 affect the ratio, since it is an implementation decision at a 
	 segmenting node to request the return optoin in the first 
	 segment or in all.

	 (ITU-T) THe quantity of CREF messages can give only an 
	 indication of SCCP QoS, since the SCCP user is the most likely 
	 generator of the CREF, rather than the SCCP.  Timeout of 
	 establishment timers, reception of ERR or RLSD messages also 
	 have a bearing on the SCCP QoS.

	 All measurements in this table are total counts accumulated 
	 from the last agent reboot.

	 These measurements are measured over 5 minute intervals for 
	 performance analysis and over 15 minute intervals for network 
	 administration and planning.

	 Note: These operations measurements must be enabled permanently 
	 for 15 minute collection.

	 Measurements 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12, 9.13 and 9.14 are 
	 utilization measurements for the data messages, (ANSI) sent and 
	 received using the, (ITU-T) that are originated by or delivered 
	 to a local subsystem through, SCCP connection oriented 
	 services.  They are counted per SSN.

	 These measurements are measured over 5 minute intervals for

	 administration and planning.

	 Note: When provided, it is recommended by ANSI that these
