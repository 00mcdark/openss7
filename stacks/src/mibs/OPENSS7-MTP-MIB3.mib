-- Default values:

-- The purpose of these default scalars is two-fold: 1. to 
-- provide a localized set of default values to be applied when 
-- creatinging underspecified entries in the m2paProtocolProfile 
-- table; 2. to provide values where no protocol profile is 
-- specified.  These are default-default values in the sense 
-- that the act as default values for management operations, 
-- however, once set by a management station or by internal 
-- system operations, they persist across both agent and system 
-- reboots.

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This scalar defines, for M2PA, by default whether the 
         Nagle algorithm should be applied to SCTP associations.  
         The Nagle algorithm increases the size of the packets

         transmission of some data during congestion episodes.  
         When set to true(1), the Nagle algorithm is suppressed; 
         otherwise, set to false(2), the Nagle algorithm is in 
         effect.
         
         The default default is true(1): send packets without 
         delay.  The default default value is only application 
         when never set by any management station.  When set,

         payload size for outgoing packets.  Values greater than 
         the association MTU are ignored and have no effect.  
         The value determines the maximum size (in octets) above 
         which SCCP will fragment larger DATA chunis into 
         smaller DATA chunks, and beneath which SCTP will bundle 
         DATA chunks into a single packate or combine smaller 
         DATA chunks into larger DATA chunks.  Normally this 
         value is the association MTU value must the size of the 
         current IP and SCTP headers, minus the size of one DATA 
         chunk header.  When set to a lower value, the lower 
         value will be used.
         
         The default default allows the prevailing MTU to be

    SYNTAX      TimeInterval
    UNITS       "centiseconds"
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This scalar defines, for M2PA, the default time 
         interval (in milliseconds) between successive HEARTBEAT 
         messages used to probe destination transport addresses 
         for RTT calculation and activity.  Valid values are 
         zero (0) - do not heartbeat, or a value of 1 
         millisecond or greater.
         
         In general this value determines the amount of time 
         that it takes for an SCTP association to detect a 
         failure on a association which has no data to transmit 
         or retransmit.  M2PA, however, is used by MTP Level 3 
         which generates a test message every T2, where T2 is 
         defined in ITU-T Rec. Q.707 (1993) or ANSI T1.111.7 
         (2000) to have a range from 4 to 12 seconds.  
         Therefore, for M2PA, unless the SCTP heartbeat interval 
         is set below Q.707-T2, it will only have effect on 
         multihomed associations for checking the status of 
         non-primary or non-CMT destinations.
         
         Reducing this value will reduce the amount of time 
         taken to detect primary and non-primary, non-CMT path, 
         interface and destination failures, but may only affect 
         primary destinations if reduced below the coresponding 
         Q.707-T2 value.
         
         The default default value is that recommended by RFC 
         4960 (6000 centiseconds, or 60 seconds).  The default 
         default value is only application when never set by any 
         management station.  When set, the scalar value must 
         persist across system reboots."

         Disabling the heart beat mechanism reduces the

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This column defines the time interval (in milliseconds) 
         in conjunction with m2paSctpCookieInc beyond which a 
         COOKIE-ECHO received with a cookie sent in an INIT-ACK 
         will no longer be accepted.  For SCTP, this also limits 
         the maximum time interval for which the HMAC secret key 
         for the cookie will be valid.  Valid values are zero or 
         greater.  Values of zero will  be converted to a system 
         clock tick.  The default value is the value recommended 
         by RFC 2960 (60,000 milliseconds, or 60 seconds).
         
         Reducing this value will increase the probability that 
         passive connection attempts will fail due to expired 
         cookies.  Increasing the value will reduce the overall 
         security of the system by permitting attackers an 
         increased interval within which to crack HMACs and 
         guess verification tags.  This value may be adjusted in 
         conjunction with m2paSctpCookieInc to meet most 
         objectives for successful passive connection attempts 
         with the best security afforded by smaller values of 
         m2paSctpCookieLife.
         
         Unfortunately, the m2paSctpCookieLife and 
         m2paSctpCookieInc must be adjusted to accomodate the 
         slowest peer on the slowest connection.  The default 
         setting is adequate for Internet applications.

        "A signalling point is a node in the signalling network. 
         It is part of a managed switching element (exchange).

         SEP: the signalling end point, this type of SP contains 
         MTP and ISUP (and or other MTP Users), but cannot act 
         as an intermediate MTP transfer node in the SS No.7 
         network. (It can act as an SCCP Relay Node.)
         
         STP: the MTP signalling transfer point, this type of SP 
         acts as an intermediate node between SEPs to transfer 
         messages through the SS No.7-network, it only contains 
         MTP. (In case of an STP, OMAP, and hence also TC and 
         SCCP may be present.)
         
         STEP: MTP signalling transfer and end point, the type 
         combines the previous mentioned types, thus acting both 
         as a SEP and as a STP.
         
         A mtpSignPoint can have the MTP status:
         
         allowed, this means that the mtpSignPoint is accessible 
         and is functioning normally (operational state = 
         enabled, availability status = '')
         
         congested, this means that the mtpSignPoint is 
         accessible but is heavily loaded (operational state = 
         enabled, availability status = {degraded})
         
         prohibited, this means that the mtpSignPoint not 
         accessible (operational state = disabled).
         
         During MTP restart, the proceduralStatus is 
         {initializing} until the restart is finished."

         from 5 to 120 seconds.
         
         This timer value and procedure is in effect whenever 
         the signalling link is set to use link oscillation 
         procedure A.  For link oscillation procedure B, see 
         mtpSignPointMtpT33A and mtpSignPointMtpT34A.  For link

         [sic] prevent links from oscillating rapidly between 
         the in-service and out-of-service states, a link

         This procedure is applicable in all cases where 
         automatic restoration and removal of signalling links 
         to and from service is used.  The procedure is not 
         invoked if restoration to or removal from service is 
         initiated manually.
         
         Link oscillation filtering is a local procedure.  One 
         of the following procedures, A or B, is used.
         
         (A) When restoration begins, the oscillation timer T32 
         is started.  If the link fails within T32, the link is 
         placed in the 'suspension' state until T32 expires.
         
         When a link exits in the 'suspension' state, link 
         restoration is to be started and T32 is restarted.
         
         When a link is in 'suspension,' the link remains in the 
         out-of-service state at level 2, restoration procedures 
         to bring the link back into alignment are not invoked 
         and realignment attempts initiated by the remote end 
         are ignored.
         
         The oscillation timer T32 value chosen in a given 
         signalling point may be modified by management action.  
         The expiration of the timer does not change the link 
         status."

         8. If signalling point Y receives a remote inhibit test 
            message from signalling point X and the concerned 
            signalling link is not marked locally inhibited, the 
            uninhibiting procedure is invoked at signalling 
            point Y, beginning with the transmission of an 
            uninhibit signalling link message to signalling 
            point X.  As a result of this procedure, the remote 
            inhibit indicator is canceled at signalling point X.

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This managed object class represents the SS No. 7 
         signalling link set termination point. Link sets are 
         defined in Recommendation Q.704. The states are 
         directly related to the set of link termination point's 
         states, except for the optional administrativeState.
         
         General principles on state information:
         
         The states of the managed object linkset are only 
         readable, except for the optional administrativeState.
         
         Activation and deactivation of a linkset may be done 
         via operations on the links (e.g. by using scoping 
         functions) or the optional administrativeState can be 
         used for this.
         
         Based on these principles the states of a linkset are 
         defined as follows:
         
         operational state (read-only for the OS). The 
         operational state is enabled whenever one link of the 
         linkset is enabled, i.e. neither FAILED nor DEACTIVATED 
         nor LOCAL BLOCKED nor REMOTE BLOCKED.
         
         Usage state (read-only for the OS). The usage state 
         reflects the usage of the belonging links. It is ACTIVE 
         if at least one of the belonging links is ACTIVE and no 
         link is BUSY. It contains BUSY if one of the belonging 
         links is BUSY. It is IDLE if all links are UNAVAILABLE.
         
         Availability status (read-only for the OS). The 
         availability status indicates unavailability or reduced 
         availability of the belonging links. It contains 
         DEPENDENCY if all the belonging links are unavailable 
         for user traffic. It contains DEGRADED if at least one 
         belonging link is not available for user traffic. For 
         the different reasons of unavailability (failed, 
         deactivated, local blocked, remote blocked, local 
         inhibited and remote inhibited) see 3.2.1/Q.704.
         
         If the 'ITU-T Rec. X.721 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10165-2 : 
         1992':communicationsAlarm notification is used, the

         and Q.752/4.4 (PerceivedSeverity=Cleared).

         and status changes."

        "This managed object represents the termination of the 
         signalling link within the signalling point as defined 
         in Recommendation Q.703. The signLinkTp object class 
         represents that part of a signalling link which is 
         located in one NE.
         
         The following state and status attributes are 
         supported:
         
         administrative state:
         
         locked: it is administratively not permitted to 
         transport traffic on the link termination point.
         
         unlocked: it is administratively permitted to transport 
         user part traffic or test traffic on the link 
         termination point.
         
         operational state:
         
         enabled: the link termination point is operationally 
         able to transport user part traffic or test traffic.
         
         disabled: the link termination point is operationally 
         unable to transport user part traffic or test traffic. 
         The operational state is disabled whenever the link 
         termination point status contains Failed, Deactivated, 
         Local Blocked, Remote Blocked, or the procedural status 
         is Initializing.
         
         usage state:
         
         idle: the link termination point carries no user part 
         traffic (test traffic may be present).
         
         'active': the link termination point is not congested. 
         Currently the link termination point carries user part 
         traffic.
         
         busy: the link termination point is congested due to 
         user part traffic. The usage state is idle whenever the 
         link termination point status is not empty i.e.  the 
         usage state immediately reflects the availability of 
         the signLinkTp for user traffic.
         
         For national MTP options applying several congestion 
         levels an additional attribute indicating these levels 
         may be added.
         
         procedural status:
         
         The procedural status initializing is valid during 
         initial alignment procedure.
         
         The procedural status not initalized applies when the 
         link termination point is not aligned and the initial 
         alignment procedure has not been started.
         
         Link termination point status. This is a set-valued 
         attribute. The following statusses can exist alone or 
         in combinations with each other. The exact definition 
         for each of the following SS7-functional states is to 
         be gained from Q.704 local blocked remote blocked local 
         inhibited remote inhibited failed deactivated.
         
         If the 'ITU-T Rec. X.721 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10165-2 : 
         1992':communicationsAlarm notification is used, the

         Probable Cause = 210 (remoteProcOutage) which 
         represents measurements Q.752/2.10

         vii)  the spTimersProfilePackage is present in the

         Q.704/1996 10.6 (Inhibit test procedure)  When a 
         signalling link becomes management inhibited, periodic 
         tests are started to guard the inhibition status at 
         each end of the link.
         
         10.6.2  A remote inhibit test is performed when timer 
         T23 expires at signalling point Y and the concerned 
         link is marked remotely inhibited.  In this case a 
         remote inhibit test message is sent to signalling point 
         X at the other end of the link, and timer T23 is 
         restarted."

         (A) When restoration begins, the oscillation timer T32 
         is started.  If the link fails within T32, the link is

         When a link exits in the 'suspension' state, link 
         restoration is to be started and T32 is restarted.
         
         When a link is in 'suspension,' the link remains in the 
         out-of-service state at level 2, restoration procedures

         acknowledgement message is not received on the link 
         being tested within T1 (see 5.5) after the signalling 
         link test message has been sent, the test is considered 
         to have failed and is repeated once.  In the case when 
         also the repeat test fails, the following actions have 
         to be taken:
         
         - SLT applied on activation/restoration, the link is 
           put out of service, restoration is attempted and a 
           management system must be informed.
         
         - SLT applied periodically, for further study.
         
         IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:- The action when the periodic test 
         fails is for further study.  Taking the link out of 
         service can be an especially bad idea during times of 
         congestion. This is because the buffers may be filled 
         with management messages already and the signalling 
         link test might fail due to timeout. We merely report 
         the information to management and leave the link in 
         service. If the test failed because of an inserted 
         loop-back while the link is in service, the link will 
         fail rapidly due to other causes. So we do nothing more 
         than report to management."

    DESCRIPTION 
        "A signalling route (A,C,B)i is defined as an ordered 
         sequence of the near end signalling point A (i.e. the 
         network element), an adjacent SP C and the destination 
         SP B. The adjacent SP C may be identical with the 
         destination B, or it may or may not be directly 
         interconnected to the destination SP. The adjacent SP C 
         must be directly connected to the near end SP by at 
         least one linkset which is intended to convey MSUs sent 
         from A to B (hence the use of the term 'adjacent').
         
         Two signalling routes (A,C,B)i and (A,C,B)j are 
         distinct if the adjacent SP is different.
         
         The signRouteNePart Managed Object class defines the 
         management capabilities of the resources which define a 
         specific route segment (Link Set to be traversed) and 
         its priority within the routeset as seen from the own 
         SP. A particular signRouteNePart is related to one or 
         more Signalling Routes on the network level.
         
         The priority in which the network Signalling Routes are 
         used, is defined by means of assigning priorities to 
         all involved route segments. If from a particular SP 
         two or more route segments are used with the same 
         priority, loadsharing between Signalling Routes may 
         occur.
         
         A Combined Link Set is a set of Link Sets used with the 
         same priority by message routing.
         
         The signLinkSetTp used for routing is allocated at 
         creation time and cannot be changed during the 
         existence of a particular signRouteNePart.
         
         The administrativeState attribute describes whether it 
         is administratively permitted to route messages towards 
         the respective destination point via the referenced 
         signLinkSetTp.
         
         The operationalState attribute is 'enabled' if both the 
         referenced signLinkSetTp is in the operational state 
         'enabled' and no TFP message concerning the respective 
         destination has been received from the adjPC of the 
         respective signLinkSetTp.
         
         The optional usageState attribute is used to cover 
         restriction of a route. Its value is set to 'busy', if 
         the route is restricted ('transfer restricted' is a 
         national option).
         
         The availabilityStatus attribute gives additional 
         information about the availability of the 
         signRouteNePart instance. It is furthermore needed to 
         map some of the MTP functional states (prohibited: 
         availabilityStatus = {dependency}, restricted: 
         availabilityStatus={degraded}) and is used for the case 
         that the route is locked not by the OS, but e.g. by a 
         local administrator (administrativeState=unlocked and 
         availabilityStatus={off line})."

         the MTP messages or an STP. A particular 
         signRouteSetNePart may be related to one or more 
         Signalling Route Sets on network level.
         
         The administrativeState attribute describes whether it

         signRouteNePart contained within the 
         signRouteSetNePart.
         
         The operationalState attribute describes whether the 
         respective destination signalling point is accessible - 
         ('enabled') or not ('disabled'). If the operational 
         states of all signRouteNePart instances contained in 
         the signRouteSetNePart are 'disabled', then the 
         operational state of the signRouteSetNePart is 
         'disabled', in any other case it is 'enabled'.
         
         The usageState attribute is used to reflect route set 
         congestion. The value is 'busy' in case of route set 
         congestion.

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This managed object class represents the SS No. 7 
         signalling link set termination point. Link sets are 
         defined in Recommendation Q.704. The states are 
         directly related to the set of link termination point's 
         states, except for the optional administrativeState.
         
         General principles on state information:
         
         The states of the managed object linkset are only 
         readable, except for the optional administrativeState.
         
         Activation and deactivation of a linkset may be done 
         via operations on the links (e.g. by using scoping 
         functions) or the optional administrativeState can be 
         used for this.
         
         Based on these principles the states of a linkset are 
         defined as follows:
         
         operational state (read-only for the OS). The 
         operational state is enabled whenever one link of the 
         linkset is enabled, i.e. neither FAILED nor DEACTIVATED 
         nor LOCAL BLOCKED nor REMOTE BLOCKED.
         
         Usage state (read-only for the OS). The usage state 
         reflects the usage of the belonging links. It is ACTIVE 
         if at least one of the belonging links is ACTIVE and no 
         link is BUSY. It contains BUSY if one of the belonging 
         links is BUSY. It is IDLE if all links are UNAVAILABLE.
         
         Availability status (read-only for the OS). The 
         availability status indicates unavailability or reduced 
         availability of the belonging links. It contains 
         DEPENDENCY if all the belonging links are unavailable 
         for user traffic. It contains DEGRADED if at least one 
         belonging link is not available for user traffic. For 
         the different reasons of unavailability (failed, 
         deactivated, local blocked, remote blocked, local 
         inhibited and remote inhibited) see 3.2.1/Q.704.
         
         If the 'ITU-T Rec. X.721 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10165-2 : 
         1992':communicationsAlarm notification is used, the 
         following probable causes can apply:
         
         Probable Cause=403 (LinkSetFailure), which represents 
         measurements Q.752/4.3 (PerceivedSeverity=Maj/Min/War) 
         and Q.752/4.4 (PerceivedSeverity=Cleared).

         and status changes."

         enabled: the link termination point is operationally 
         able to transport user part traffic or test traffic.
         
         disabled: the link termination point is operationally 
         unable to transport user part traffic or test traffic. 
         The operational state is disabled whenever the link 
         termination point status contains Failed, Deactivated, 
         Local Blocked, Remote Blocked, or the procedural status 
         is Initializing.
         
         usage state:
         
         idle: the link termination point carries no user part 
         traffic (test traffic may be present).
         
         'active': the link termination point is not congested. 
         Currently the link termination point carries user part 
         traffic.
         
         busy: the link termination point is congested due to 
         user part traffic. The usage state is idle whenever the 
         link termination point status is not empty i.e.  the 
         usage state immediately reflects the availability of 
         the signLinkTp for user traffic.
         
         For national MTP options applying several congestion 
         levels an additional attribute indicating these levels 
         may be added.
         
         procedural status:
         
         The procedural status initializing is valid during 
         initial alignment procedure.
         
         The procedural status not initalized applies when the 
         link termination point is not aligned and the initial 
         alignment procedure has not been started.
         
         Link termination point status. This is a set-valued 
         attribute. The following statusses can exist alone or 
         in combinations with each other. The exact definition 
         for each of the following SS7-functional states is to 
         be gained from Q.704 local blocked remote blocked local 
         inhibited remote inhibited failed deactivated.

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "A signalling route (A,C,B)i is defined as an ordered 
         sequence of the near end signalling point A (i.e. the 
         network element), an adjacent SP C and the destination 
         SP B. The adjacent SP C may be identical with the 
         destination B, or it may or may not be directly 
         interconnected to the destination SP. The adjacent SP C 
         must be directly connected to the near end SP by at 
         least one linkset which is intended to convey MSUs sent 
         from A to B (hence the use of the term 'adjacent').
         
         Two signalling routes (A,C,B)i and (A,C,B)j are 
         distinct if the adjacent SP is different.
         
         The signRouteNePart Managed Object class defines the 
         management capabilities of the resources which define a 
         specific route segment (Link Set to be traversed) and 
         its priority within the routeset as seen from the own 
         SP. A particular signRouteNePart is related to one or 
         more Signalling Routes on the network level.
         
         The priority in which the network Signalling Routes are 
         used, is defined by means of assigning priorities to 
         all involved route segments. If from a particular SP 
         two or more route segments are used with the same 
         priority, loadsharing between Signalling Routes may 
         occur.
         
         A Combined Link Set is a set of Link Sets used with the 
         same priority by message routing.
         
         The signLinkSetTp used for routing is allocated at 
         creation time and cannot be changed during the 
         existence of a particular signRouteNePart.
         
         The administrativeState attribute describes whether it 
         is administratively permitted to route messages towards 
         the respective destination point via the referenced 
         signLinkSetTp.
         
         The operationalState attribute is 'enabled' if both the 
         referenced signLinkSetTp is in the operational state 
         'enabled' and no TFP message concerning the respective 
         destination has been received from the adjPC of the 
         respective signLinkSetTp.
         
         The optional usageState attribute is used to cover 
         restriction of a route. Its value is set to 'busy', if 
         the route is restricted ('transfer restricted' is a 
         national option).
         
         The availabilityStatus attribute gives additional 
         information about the availability of the 
         signRouteNePart instance. It is furthermore needed to 
         map some of the MTP functional states (prohibited: 
         availabilityStatus = {dependency}, restricted: 
         availabilityStatus={degraded}) and is used for the case 
         that the route is locked not by the OS, but e.g. by a 
         local administrator (administrativeState=unlocked and 
         availabilityStatus={off line})."

    DESCRIPTION 
        "A Signalling Route Set is a complete set of routes that 
         can be used to carry traffic toward a specific 
         destination signalling point. The signRouteSetNePart 
         Managed Object class defines the management 
         capabilities of the resources which represent a 
         specific destination SP and its accessibility as seen 
         from the own SP. This SP may be the originating SP of 
         the MTP messages or an STP. A particular 
         signRouteSetNePart may be related to one or more 
         Signalling Route Sets on network level.
         
         The administrativeState attribute describes whether it 
         is administratively permitted to route SS No. 7 MSUs 
         towards the respective destination point.  Before the 
         administrative state of a signRouteSetNePart can be set 
         to 'unlocked', there must be at least one 
         signRouteNePart contained within the 
         signRouteSetNePart.
         
         The operationalState attribute describes whether the 
         respective destination signalling point is accessible - 
         ('enabled') or not ('disabled'). If the operational 
         states of all signRouteNePart instances contained in 
         the signRouteSetNePart are 'disabled', then the 
         operational state of the signRouteSetNePart is 
         'disabled', in any other case it is 'enabled'.
         
         The usageState attribute is used to reflect route set 
         congestion. The value is 'busy' in case of route set 
         congestion.
