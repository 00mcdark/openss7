    DESCRIPTION
	"This is a network referenced signalling point code that

	 'network' portion of the signalling point code as defined in 
	 Q.704; the third, the 'cluster'; and, the fourth and last, the 
	 'member'.  This is displayed with a colon separating the 
	 network number and the normal numbers and dashes notation for 
	 the signalling point code: e.g. 1:5-1-1.  Note that an ITU-T 
	 signalling point code is unpacked by network, cluster and 
	 member into separate octets.  Also note that when the first 
	 octet is zero (0) it does not specify a global larger network 
	 and thus the network point code applies only to a locally 
	 defined network."

-- ====================================================================
-- Most of the notifications defined here are for reporting first and

-- performance monitoring.  Some of these notifications overlap with 
-- communications alarms.

-- Notification objects (scalars) for use in notifications.

-- The TMN (Q.751.1) way of providing on-occurrence events from Q.752 
-- notifications is to provide a special ss7OnOccEvent notification 
-- which performs double duty as a communicationsAlarm (that is, it 
-- contains the same information as a communications alarm).  That 
-- approach is duplicated here to limit the number of unique 
-- notifications necessary to represent all of the events to one, which 
-- also provides alarms.

	 ANSI T1.111.4/20000 9.2 ... When the first signalling link goes

	    signalling point begins taking into account any 
	    transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, transfer-allowed, 
	    traffic restart allowed, and traffic restart waiting 
	    messages received.  The restarting point starts timers T22 
	    and T26 either when the first signalling link goes into the 
	    in service state at level 2 or when the first signalling 
	    link becomes available at level 3.  When a traffic restart 
	    waiting message is received before user traffic is restarted 
	    on the link(s) to the point that sent the traffic restart 
	    waiting message, timer T25 is started and user traffic is 
	    not restarted on that link set until after a traffic restart 
	    allowed message is received or timer T25 expires (see 9.3).
	 
	    When the first signalling link of a signalling link set is 
	    available, MTP message traffic terminating at the far end of 
	    the signalling link set is immediately restarted (see also 
	    9.5), and a traffic restart waiting message is sent to the 
	    point at the end of the link set.
	 
	    Whenever timer T26 expires, the restarting signalling point 
	    restarts timer T26 and broadcasts a traffic restart waiting 
	    message to those adjacent signalling points connected by an 
	    available link.
	 
	    T22 is stopped when sufficient links are available to carry 
	    the expected signalling traffic: stopping T22 is a 
	    management decision that may take into account factors such 
	    as the known long term unavailability of certain signalling 
	    links because of equipment failures.
	 
	    When T22 is stopped or expires, the signalling point starts 
	    a timer T23, during which it expects to receive additional 
	    transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, transfer-allowed 
	    (see Section 13), traffic restart waiting, and traffic 
	    restart allowed messages.  When traffic restart allowed 
	    message have been received for all available links or the 
	    management function determines that sufficient traffic 
	    restart allowed messages have been received that the 
	    expected traffic can be handled, T23 is stopped.
	 
	 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:- T22 is used to place an upper limit on 
	    the availability of sufficient signalling links to handle 
	    the expected load.  A good rule of thumb would be that when 
	    at least half of the signalling links in each signalling 
	    link set are available, that there are sufficient links 
	    available to handle traffic; however, this does not include 
	    the knowledge of long term failures.  Note that T22 is set 
	    to about 10 minutes, and it would be really bad if there was 
	    a signalling link set will long term link failures that kept 
	    it below the rule of thumb causing the restart to take 
	    longer than 10 minutes.  Therefore a better rule of thumb 
	    might be that half the signalling links are either active or 
	    management blocked or in link oscillation lockout.  With 
	    reference to ITU, this is still Restart Phase 1 and the next 
	    phase is also Restart Phase 1."

	"Provides the signalling point table which defines all of the

	 A signalling point is a node in the signalling network.  It is 
	 part of a managed switching element (exchange).  The MTP 
	 permits three types of node:
	 
	  - SEP: the signalling end point, this type of SP contains MTP 
	    and ISUP (and or other MTP Users), but cannot act as an 
	    intermediate MTP transfer node in the SS No.7 network. (It 
	    can act as an SCCP Relay Node.)
	 
	  - STP: the MTP signalling transfer point, this type of SP acts 
	    as an intermediate node between SEPs to transfer messages 
	    through the SS No.7-network, it only contains MTP. (In case 
	    of an STP, OMAP, and hence also TC and SCCP may be present.)
	 
	  - STEP: MTP signalling transfer and end point, the type 
	    combines the previous mentioned types, thus acting both as a 
	    SEP and as a STP.
	 
	 A mtpSignPoint can have the MTP status:
	 
	  - allowed, this means that the mtpSignPoint is accessible and 
	    is functioning normally (operational state = enabled, 
	    availability status = '')
	 
	  - congested, this means that the mtpSignPoint is accessible 
	    but is heavily loaded (operational state = enabled, 
	    availability status = {degraded})
	 
	  - prohibited, this means that the mtpSignPoint not accessible 
	    (operational state = disabled).
	 
	 During MTP restart, the proceduralStatus is {initializing} 
	 until the restart is finished."

	   necessary TFP and TFR message to Y; then X sends a traffic

	 corresponding TFA or TFR message is sent to the signalling 
	 point Y whose MTP is restarting.
	 
	 If a signalling point becomes prohibited or restricted to 
	 signalling X after a TRA message has been sent by X to Y, X 
	 sends a corresponding TFP or TFR message to Y.

	    allowed, and traffic restart waiting messages received.  The 
	    restarting point starts timers T22 and T26 either when the

	 ANSI T1.111.4/2000 9.3 A signalling point X considers that the 
	    MTP of an inaccessible adjacent signalling point Y is 
	    restarting when: (1) The first link in a direct link set is 
	    in the in service state at level 2, or (2) A route other 
	    than a direct link set becomes available, e.g.  through

	    When the first link in a direct link set toward the

	     1. If a TRW message is received from Y while T28 is running 
		or before it is started, X starts T25.  X stops T28 if 
		it is running.

		restart allowed message or, if X has the transfer 
		function, a traffic restart waiting message followed by

		allowed message.
	 
	     4. If a destination becomes prohibited, restricted, or 
		available at X, after X has sent a traffic restart

		gives MTP-RESUME primitives to users concerning Y and 
		any destinations made accessible via Y.  If X has the 
		transfer function it also broadcasts transfer-allowed or

	     6. If T28 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set to Y

    DESCRIPTION
	"This managed object class represents the SS No. 7 signalling 
	 link set termination point. Link sets are defined in 
	 Recommendation Q.704. The states are directly related to the 
	 set of link termination point's states, except for the optional 
	 administrativeState.
	 
	 General principles on state information:
	 
	  1. The states of the managed object linkset are only readable, 
	     except for the optional administrativeState.
	 
	  2. Activation and deactivation of a linkset may be done via 
	     operations on the links (e.g. by using scoping functions) 
	     or the optional administrativeState can be used for this.
	 
	 Based on these principles the states of a linkset are defined 
	 as follows:
	 
	  - operational state (read-only for the OS). The operational 
	    state is enabled whenever one link of the linkset is 
	    enabled, i.e.  neither FAILED nor DEACTIVATED nor LOCAL 
	    BLOCKED nor REMOTE BLOCKED.
	 
	  - Usage state (read-only for the OS). The usage state reflects 
	    the usage of the belonging links. It is ACTIVE if at least 
	    one of the belonging links is ACTIVE and no link is BUSY. It 
	    contains BUSY if one of the belonging links is BUSY. It is 
	    IDLE if all links are UNAVAILABLE.
	 
	  - Availability status (read-only for the OS). The availability 
	    status indicates unavailability or reduced availability of 
	    the belonging links. It contains DEPENDENCY if all the 
	    belonging links are unavailable for user traffic. It 
	    contains DEGRADED if at least one belonging link is not 
	    available for user traffic.  For the different reasons of 
	    unavailability (failed, deactivated, local blocked, remote 
	    blocked, local inhibited and remote inhibited) see 
	    3.2.1/Q.704.

	    Q.752/4.4 (PerceivedSeverity=Cleared).
	 
	 State change notifications are emitted for all state and status

    DESCRIPTION
	"This object provides both the status of the signalling link and 
	 the mechanism for peforming inhibit and uninhibit actions on 
	 the signalling link.
	 
	 This is a set-valued attribute.  The following status can exist 
	 alone or in combinations with each other.  The exact definition 
	 for each of the following SS7-functional states is to be gained 
	 from Q.704: localBlocked(0), remoteBlocked(1), 
	 localInhibited(2), remoteInhibited(3), failed(4), 
	 deactivated(5).
	 
	 The localInhibit action of Q.751.1 can be performed by 
	 requesting a SET operation from a management station with a 
	 mtpSlLinkStatus value containing the localInihibted(2) bit set.  
	 Performing the localInhibit action inhibits the signalling 
	 link.  If the inhibition procedure completes successfully, a 
	 GET operation on the mtpSlLinkStatus will reveal a 
	 localInihibit(2) bit that is set.  The action is not performed 
	 when the signalling link is already locally inhibited.
	 
	 The localUninhibit action of Q.751.1 can be performed by 
	 performing a SET operation from a management station with a 
	 mtpSlLinkStatus value containing the localInhibited(2) bit 
	 cleared.  Performgin the localUninhibit action uninhibits the 
	 signalling link.  If the uninhibition procedure completes 
	 successfully, a GET operation on the mtpSlLinkStatus will 
	 reveal a localInhibit(2) bit that is clear.  The action is not 
	 performed when the signalling link is already locally 
	 inhibited."

	 is the value recommended by RFC 2960 (60,000 milliseconds, or 
	 60 seconds).
	 
	 Reducing this value will increase the probability that passive 
	 connection attempts will fail due to expired cookies.  
	 Increasing the value will reduce the overall security of the 
	 system by permitting attackers an increased interval within 
	 which to crack HMACs and guess verification tags.  This value

	"This scalar defines, for M2PA, the default time interval (in

	 probe destination transport addresses for RTT calculation and 
	 activity.  Valid values are zero (0) - do not heartbeat, or a 
	 value of 1 millisecond or greater.
	 
	 In general this value determines the amount of time that it 
	 takes for an SCTP association to detect a failure on a 
	 association which has no data to transmit or retransmit.  M2PA, 
	 however, is used by MTP Level 3 which generates a test message 
	 every T2, where T2 is defined in ITU-T Rec. Q.707 (1993) or 
	 ANSI T1.111.7 (2000) to have a range from 4 to 12 seconds.  
	 Therefore, for M2PA, unless the SCTP heartbeat interval is set 
	 below Q.707-T2, it will only have effect on multihomed 
	 associations for checking the status of non-primary or non-CMT 
	 destinations.
	 
	 Reducing this value will reduce the amount of time taken to 
	 detect primary and non-primary, non-CMT path, interface and 
	 destination failures, but may only affect primary destinations 
	 if reduced below the coresponding Q.707-T2 value.
	 
	 The default default value is that recommended by RFC 4960

	 station.  When set, the scalar value must persist across system

	 maximum time interval for which the HMAC secret key for the 
	 cookie will be valid.  Valid values are zero or greater.  
	 Values of zero will  be converted to a system clock tick.
	 
	 Reducing this value will increase the probability that passive 
	 connection attempts will fail due to expired cookies.  
	 Increasing the value will reduce the overall security of the 
	 system by permitting attackers an increased interval within 
	 which to crack HMACs and guess verification tags.  This value

	 When a signalling link failure occurs, an ss7OnOccEvent 
	 notification is generated with this object as the probableCause 
	 and the failed signalling link as the objectInstance.  The 
	 specificProblems object identifier is included in the message 
	 which indicates the reason for the failure, as follows:
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to receipt of an 
	    abnormal FIB or BSN, the abnormalFIBRorBSNR object identity 
	    will be placed in the specific problem.  In this case the 
	    notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure 
	    - All reasons) and 1.3 (SL failure - Abnormal FIBR/BSNR) on 
	    occurrence notifiction.
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to excessive delay of 
	    acknowledgement, or T7 timeout, the excessiveAckDelay object 
	    identity will be placed in the specific problem.  In this 
	    case the notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL 
	    failure - All reasons) and 1.4 (SL failure - Excessive delay 
	    of ack) on occurence notification.
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to excessive error rate, 
	    or the error count surpassing the threshold in the SUERM or 
	    EIM, the excessiveErrorRate object identity will be placed 
	    in the specific problem.  In this case the notification 
	    corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure - All 
	    reasons) and 1.5 (SL failure - Excessive error rate) on 
	    ocurence notification.
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to excessive duration of 
	    congestion (i.e, Timer T6 expiry), the excessiveCongDuration 
	    object identity will be placed in the specific problem.  In 
	    this case the notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 
	    1.2 (SL failure - All reasons) and 1.6 (SL failure - 
	    Excessive duration of congestion) on occurrence 
	    notification.
	 
	  - When the signalling link failed due to a reason other than 
	    the above, or the reason cannot be determined, no object 
	    identity is placed in the specific problems.  In this case,
