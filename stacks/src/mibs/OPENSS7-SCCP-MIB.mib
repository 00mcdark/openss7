	DESCRIPTION
		"This is a list of network references signalling point 
		 codes which uniquely identifies both the national or 
		 international SS7 newtork (point code numbering space) 
		 to which the point code belongs as well as the point 
		 code within the network.  The list is composed of a 
		 integral multiple of 4 octets.  Of each 4 octet 
		 sequence, the first octet is a network identifier which 
		 identifies the larger national or international SS7 
		 network; the second octet is the 'network' portion of 
		 the signalling point code as defined in Q.704; the 
		 third, the 'cluster'; and, the fourth and last in each 
		 set, the 'member'.  Multiple network referenced point 
		 codes are listed in sequential groups of 4 octets, 
		 where the first 4 octets represent the first point code 
		 and the next four octets represent the next point code, 
		 and so on.  This list is display with a colon 
		 separating the network number and the normal numbers 
		 and dashes notation for the signalling point code, with 
		 grouping separated by commas: e.g.  
		 1:5-1-1,1:5-1-2,1:5-1-3.  Note that an ITU-T signalling 
		 point code is unpacked by network, cluster and member 
		 into separate octets.  Also not that hwen the first 
		 octet of each 4 octet grouping is zero (0) it does not 
		 specify a larger national or International network and 
		 thus the network point code applies only to a locally 
		 defined network."

-- The TMN (Q.751.2) way of providing on-occurence events from Q.752 
-- notifications is to provide a special ss7OnOccurenceEvent 
-- notification which performs double duty as a communicationsAlarm 
-- (that is, it contains the same information as a communications 
-- alarm).  That approach is duplicated here to limit the number of 
-- unique notifications necessary to represent all of the events to one, 
-- which also provides alarms.
