    DESCRIPTION 
        "MIB Module for SS7 MTP management.
         
         This MIB is based heavily on TMN (ITU-T Rec. X.721 
         (1992)) and the SS7 GDMOs (ITU-T Rec. Q.751.1 and ANSI 
         T1.116.1).  It also includes statistics, alarms, 
         notifications and operational measurements from ITU-T 
         Q.752 (1997) and ANSI T1.116.2/2000.
         
         The MIB uses the following containment principles:
         
         - A newtork contains zero or more signalling points
         
         - All objects other than a network and a signalling 
           point are contained at some level within a signalling 
           point.
         
         - A routeset is contained directly within a signalling 
           point.  A route set can be to a remote signalling 
           point to can be to an adjacent signalling point.  
           Adjacent signalling points can be one of the types 
           provided by the SpType textual convention.
         
         - A routeset can contain zero or more route lists.  A 
           route list contains one ore more routes.   A route is 
           a path to a remote or adjacent signalling point code 
           via a direct link set to (possibly another) 
           signalling point code.  Routes in a route list have 
           the same routing priority within the routeset and are 
           candidates for load sharing.
         
         - A combined link set is a set of direct link sets to 
           adjacent signalling points that are related as 
           described in Q.704.   For example, the direct link 
           sets to two STPs in an associated pair form a 
           combined link set.  Links that make up a combined 
           link set are candidates for load sharing.
         
         - A link set is a collection of signalling links whose 
           remote termination points terminate on the same 
           signalling point code.
         
         - A signalling link is a collection of a signalling 
           data link providing the facility and a signalling 
           terminal providing the access to the signalling data 
           link media.
         
         - A signalling terminal is associated with a piece of 
           physical equipment or software.
         
         - A signalling data link is associated with a piece of 
           physical equipment or software."

         standards that are most widely adopted are ITU-T based 
         or ANSI based.  The primary distiguishing factor is the 
         point code format of 3-8-3 vs. 8-8-8.  Other 
         non-European countries use 8-8-8 such as Canada, 
         Australia, China, Japan.  Japan, however, implies a 
         bunch of other variances such as MTP message priority 
         differences and so the jttc.  The UK PNOC also implies 
         some wild ISUP variances.
         
         The purpose of identifying one of these standards 
         bodies is to arrive at a popular set of defaults for 
         protocol options.

           cannot check the link for congestion when 
           transferring the buffer.  If we a transferring a very 
           large changeover buffer (up to 2 seconds worth of 
           messages at 1 Erlang) we could congest the new link 
           leading to a cascading failure.  Section 5.7.2 above, 
           does not say to transfer the buffer on T2 expiry.  
           Instead it says to start 'new traffic' on the 
           alternative signalling link(s).  Taking this 
           literally, we will flush the buffer and start new 
           traffic only."

           diversion specified in 6.4 is performed.  This is 
           made also when the concerned signalling points are 
           accessible, but there is no signalling route to it 
           using the same outgoing signalling link(s) (or one of 
           the same signalling links) from which traffic will be 
           diverted.
         
         6.4.1  The timer-controlled diversion procedure is used 
           at the end of the MTP restart procedure (see clause 
           9) when an adjacent signalling point becomes 
           available, as well as for the reasons given in 6.2.5. 
           ...
         
         6.4.2  When changeback is initiated after the MTP 
           restart procedure, the adjacent signalling point of 
           the point whose MTP is restarting stops traffic to be 
           directed from the alternative signalling link(s) for 
           a time T3, after which it starts traffic on the 
           signalling link(s) made available.  The time delay 
           minimizes the probability of out-of-sequence delivery 
           to the destination point(s)."

         Q.704/1996 10.6 (Inihibit test procedure)  When a 
         signalling link becomes mangaement inhibited, periodic 
         tests are started to guard the inhibition status at 
         each end of the link.
         
         10.6.1  A local inhibit test is performed when timer 
         T22 expires at signalling point X and the concerned 
         link is marked locally inhibited.  In this case, a 
         local inhibit test message is sent to the signalling 
         point Y at the other end of the link, and timer T22 is 
         restarted.
         
         Reception of a local inhibit test message causes:
         
         1. no action, if the concerned link is marked remotely 
            inhibited at the receiving signalling point Y; or

            receiving signalling point Y, if the concerned link 
            is not marked remotely inhibited at Y.  This 
            procedure causes the locally inhibited status of the 
            link at X to be cancelled.
         
         If a timer T22 expires and the concerned link is not 
         locally inhibited, no further action is taken."

         the information to management and leave the link in 
         service. If the test failed because of an inserted 
         loop-back while the link is in service, the link will 
         fail rapidly due to other causes. So we do nothing more

-- NOTE: Q.751.1 only associates timeouts for T6, T8 and T10 
-- with a link set.  This does not make must sense to me as T6 
-- is a controlled rerouting timer that should be provisioned on 
-- a route basis, T8 is a trasnfer prohibited inhibition timer 
-- which should be provisioned on a route-set (or route) basis.  
-- T10 is a route-set test message repeat timer that should be 
-- provisioned on a route-set basis.  In the same vein, Q.751.1 
-- does not allocate T7, T19 and T21 on a link set basis.  T7 
-- should clearly be on a link set basis as it has to do with 
-- the automatic allocation of signalling data links and 
-- terminals between signalling points for a link set.  T19 and 
-- T21 can clearly be provisioned on a link set basis as they 
-- have to do with restart procedures for the direct link set.  
-- The ANSI equivalent timers T25, T28, T29 and T30 should be 
-- provisioned according to the same reasoning.

-- Q.751.1 uses profile objects for timers.  I prefer to use 
-- inheritance as it provides more opportunity for rational 
-- underspecification when establishing objects.  For example, 
-- if standard timer values are used, it is never necessary to 
-- specify a timer when establishing any object.

-- The following are default link timers to be inherited by 
-- links created under this link set.

         9.3.1  A signalling point X considers that MTP of an 
         inaccessible adjacent signalling point Y is restarting 
         when: the first link in a direct link set is in the 'in 
         service' state at level 2; or another route becomes 
         available due either to reception of a corresponding 
         TFA, TFR or TRA message, or by the corresponding link 
         set becoming available (see 3.6.2.2).
         
         9.3.2  When the first link in a direct link set toward 
         signalling point Y, whose MTP is restarting, is in the 
         'in service' state at level 2, signalling point X 
         starts a timer T21 and takes account of any TFP, TFA 
         and TFR messages received from signalling point Y.  In 
         addition, X takes the following actions: if X has the 
         transfer function, when the direct link set is 
         available at level 3, X sends any necessary TFP and TFR 
         message to Y; then X sends a traffic restart allowed 
         message to signalling point Y.
         
         If a signalling point, previously declared to be 
         inaccessible, becomes available again before T21 is 
         stopped or expires, a corresponding TFA or TFR message 
         is sent to the signalling point Y whose MTP is 
         restarting.
         
         If a signalling point becomes prohibited or restricted 
         to signalling X after a TRA message has been sent by X 
         to Y, X sends a corresponding TFP or TFR message to Y.
         
         When a traffic restart allowed message has been 
         received by X from signalling point Y, and a TRA 
         message has been sent by X to Y, X stops timer T21.
         
         ...
         
         When T21 is stopped or expires, signalling point X 
         sends a MTP-RESUME primitive concerning Y, and all 
         signalling points made available via Y, to all local 
         MTP Users.  If X has the transfer function, it 
         broadcasts to adjacent available signalling points 
         transfer-allowed and/or transfer restricted messages 
         concerning Y and all signalling points made accessible 
         by Y.
         
         9.6.2  After the MTP of an adjacent node X has 
         restarted, and if T21 has been started (see 9.3.2), all 
         routes using X are considered to be available unless 
         corresponding TFP or TFR message have been received 
         whilst T21 was running.

         or (2) A route other than a direct link set becomes 
         available, e.g.  through receipt of a transfer allowed 
         or traffic restart allowed message or the availability 
         of the corresponding link set.
         
         When the first link in a direct link set toward the 
         restarting signalling point Y goes into the in services 
         state at level 2, signalling point X begins taking into 
         account any traffic restart waiting, traffic restart 
         allowed, transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, and 
         transfer-allowed messages from Y.  Signalling point X 
         starts timer T28 either when the first link goes into 
         the in service state at level 2 or when the first 
         signalling link becomes available at level 3.  IN 
         addition it takes the following actions:
         
         1. If a TRW message is received from Y while T28 is 
            running or before it is started, X starts T25.  X 
            stops T28 if it is running.
         
         2. If a TRW message is received from Y while T25 is 
            running, X restarts T25.
         
         3. When the first link in a link set to Y becomes 
            available, signalling point X sends to Y a traffic 
            restart allowed message or, if X has the transfer 
            function, a traffic restart waiting message followed 
            by transfer-prohibited (note that all transfer 
            prohibited messages according to 13.2.2 (1) must be 
            sent) and transfer-restricted messages and a traffic 
            restart allowed message.
         
         4. If a destination becomes prohibited, restricted, or 
            available at X, after X has sent a traffic restart 
            allowed message to Y, X notifies Y of the status 
            change by the normal procedures in Section 13.
         
         5. When a traffic restart allowed message has been sent 
            to Y and a traffic restart allowed message has been 
            received from Y, X stops T25 or T28, whichever is 
            running, and restarts traffic on the link set to Y.  
            X gives MTP-RESUME primitives to users concerning Y 
            and any destinations made accessible via Y.  If X 
            has the transfer function it also broadcasts 
            transfer-allowed or transfer-restricted messages 
            concerning the same destinations.
         
         6. If T28 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
            to Y as in (5), unless a traffic restart allowed 
            message has not been sent to Y.  In that case, X 
            starts T25 and completes the sending of transfer 
            prohibited and transfer-restricted messages, 
            followed by a traffic restart allowed message.  
            Then, unless a traffic restart waiting message has 
            been received from Y without a subsequent traffic 
            restart allowed message, X stops 25 and restarts 
            traffic on the link set to Y.
         
         7. If T25 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
            toward Y.  In the abnormal case when X has not 
            completed sending transfer-prohibited and 
            transfer-restricted messages to Y, X completes 
            sending the transfer-prohibited messages required by 
            13.2.2 (1) and sends a traffic restart allowed 
            message before restarting user traffic.
         
         8. If no traffic restart allowed message has been 
            received from Y when traffic is restarted to Y, 
            timer T9 (see 9.4) is started.
         
         When signalling point Y becomes accessible via a route 
         other than a direct link set between X and Y, X sends a 
         MTP-RESUME primitive concerning Y to all local MTP 
         users.  In addition, if signalling point X has the 
         transfer function, X sends to Y any required 
         transfer-prohibited and transfer-restricted message by 
         the available route and broadcasts transfer-allowed or 
         transfer-restricted messages concerning Y."

         ANSI T1.111.4/2000 9.3 (Actions in Signalling Point X 
         Adjacent to a Restarting Signalling Point Y.)  A 
         signalling point X considers that the MTP of an 
         inaccessible adjacent signalling point Y is restarting 
         when:
         
         1. The first link in a direct link set is in the in 
            service state at level 2, or
         
         2. A route other than a direct link set becomes 
            available, e.g., through receipt of a transfer 
            allowed or traffic restart allowed message or the 
            availability of the corresponding link set.
         
         When the first link in a direct link set toward the 
         restarting signalling point Y goes into the in service 
         state at level 2, signalling point X begins taking into 
         account any traffic restart waiting, traffic restart 
         allowed, transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, and 
         transfer-allowed messages from Y.  Signalling point X 
         starts timer T28 either when the first link goes into 
         the in services state at level 2 or when the first 
         signalling link becomes available at level 3.  In 
         addition, it takes the following actions:
         
         1. If a TRW message is received from Y while T28 is 
            running or before it is started, X starts T25.  X 
            stops T28 if it is running.
         
         2. If a TRW message is received from Y while T25 is 
            running, X restarts T25.
         
         3. When the first link in a link set to Y becomes 
            available, signalling point X sends to Y a traffic 
            restart allowed message or, if X has the transfer 
            function, a traffic restart waiting message followed 
            by transfer-prohibited (note that all 
            transfer-prohibited messages according to 13.2.2 (1) 
            must be sent) and transfer restricted messages and a 
            traffic restart allowed message.
         
         4. If a destination becomes prohibited, restricted, or 
            available at X, after X has sent a traffic restart 
            allowed message to Y, X notifies Y of the status 
            change by the normal procedures in Section 13.
         
         5. When a traffic restart allowed message has been sent 
            to Y and a traffic restart allowed message has been 
            received from Y, X stops T25 or T28, whichever is 
            running, and restarts traffic on the link set to Y.  
            X gives MTP-RESUME primitives to users concerning Y 
            and any destinations made accessible via Y.  If X 
            has the transfer function it also broadcasts 
            transfer-allowed or transfer-restricted messages 
            concerning the same destinations.
         
         6. If T28 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
            to Y as in (5), unless a traffic allowed message has 
            not been sent to Y.  In that case, X starts T25 and 
            completes the sending of transfer-prohibited and 
            transfer-restricted messages, followed by a traffic 
            restart allowed message.  Then, unless a traffic 
            restart waiting message has been received from Y 
            without a subsequent traffic restart allowed 
            message, X stops T25 and restarts traffic on the 
            link set to Y.
         
         7. If T25 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
            toward Y.  In the abnormal case when X has not 
            completed sending transfer-prohibited and 
            transfer-restricted messages to Y, X completes 
            sending the transfer-prohibited messages required by 
            13.2.2 (1) and sends a traffic restart allowed 
            message before restarting user traffic.
         
         8. If no traffic restart allowed message has been 
            received from Y when traffic is restarted to Y, 
            timer T29 (see 9.4) is started.
         
         When signalling point Y becomes accessible via a route 
         other than a direct link set between X and Y, X sends 
         an MTP-RESUME primitive concerning Y to all local MTP 
         users.  In addition, if signalling point X has the 
         transfer function, X sends to Y any required 
         transfer-prohibited and transfer-restricted messages by 
         the available route and broadcasts transfer-allowed or 
         transfer-restricted messages concerning Y."

         9.3.1  A signalling point X considers that MTP of an 
         inaccessible adjacent signalling point Y is restarting 
         when: the first link in a direct link set is in the 'in 
         service' state at level 2; or another route becomes 
         available due either to reception of a corresponding 
         TFA, TFR or TRA message, or by the corresponding link 
         set becoming available (see 3.6.2.2).
         
         9.3.2  When the first link in a direct link set toward 
         signalling point Y, whose MTP is restarting, is in the 
         'in service' state at level 2, signalling point X 
         starts a timer T21 and takes account of any TFP, TFA 
         and TFR messages received from signalling point Y.  In 
         addition, X takes the following actions: if X has the 
         transfer function, when the direct link set is 
         available at level 3, X sends any necessary TFP and TFR 
         message to Y; then X sends a traffic restart allowed 
         message to signalling point Y.
         
         If a signalling point, previously declared to be 
         inaccessible, becomes available again before T21 is 
         stopped or expires, a corresponding TFA or TFR message 
         is sent to the signalling point Y whose MTP is 
         restarting.
         
         If a signalling point becomes prohibited or restricted 
         to signalling X after a TRA message has been sent by X 
         to Y, X sends a corresponding TFP or TFR message to Y.
         
         When a traffic restart allowed message has been 
         received by X from signalling point Y, and a TRA 
         message has been sent by X to Y, X stops timer T21.
         
         ...
         
         When T21 is stopped or expires, signalling point X 
         sends a MTP-RESUME primitive concerning Y, and all 
         signalling points made available via Y, to all local 
         MTP Users.  If X has the transfer function, it 
         broadcasts to adjacent available signalling points 
         transfer-allowed and/or transfer restricted messages 
         concerning Y and all signalling points made accessible 
         by Y.
         
         9.6.2  After the MTP of an adjacent node X has 
         restarted, and if T21 has been started (see 9.3.2), all 
         routes using X are considered to be available unless 
         corresponding TFP or TFR message have been received 
         whilst T21 was running.

         ANSI T1.111.4/2000 9.1 When the first signalling link 
         goes into the in service state at level 2, the 
         restarting signalling point begins taking into account 
         any transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, 
         transfer-allowed, traffic restart allowed, and traffic 
         restart waiting messages received.  The restarting 
         point starts timers T22 and T26 either when the first 
         signalling link goes in the in service state at level 2 
         or when the first signalling link becomes available at 
         level 3.  When a traffic restart waiting message is 
         receive before user traffic is restarted on the link(s) 
         to the point that sent the traffic restart waiting 
         message, timer T25 is started and user traffic is not 
         restarted on that link set until a traffic restart 
         allowed message is received or timer T25 expires (see 
         9.3).
         
         ANSI T1.111.4/2000 9.3 A signalling point X considers 
         that the MTP of an inaccessible adjacent signalling 
         point Y is restarting when: (1) The first link in a 
         direct link set is in the in service state at level 2, 
         or (2) A route other than a direct link set becomes 
         available, e.g.  through receipt of a transfer allowed 
         or traffic restart allowed message or the availability 
         of the corresponding link set.
         
         When the first link in a direct link set toward the 
         restarting signalling point Y goes into the in services 
         state at level 2, signalling point X begins taking into 
         account any traffic restart waiting, traffic restart 
         allowed, transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, and 
         transfer-allowed messages from Y.  Signalling point X 
         starts timer T28 either when the first link goes into 
         the in service state at level 2 or when the first 
         signalling link becomes available at level 3.  IN 
         addition it takes the following actions:
         
         1. If a TRW message is received from Y while T28 is 
            running or before it is started, X starts T25.  X 
            stops T28 if it is running.
         
         2. If a TRW message is received from Y while T25 is 
            running, X restarts T25.
         
         3. When the first link in a link set to Y becomes 
            available, signalling point X sends to Y a traffic 
            restart allowed message or, if X has the transfer 
            function, a traffic restart waiting message followed 
            by transfer-prohibited (note that all transfer 
            prohibited messages according to 13.2.2 (1) must be 
            sent) and transfer-restricted messages and a traffic 
            restart allowed message.
         
         4. If a destination becomes prohibited, restricted, or 
            available at X, after X has sent a traffic restart 
            allowed message to Y, X notifies Y of the status 
            change by the normal procedures in Section 13.
         
         5. When a traffic restart allowed message has been sent 
            to Y and a traffic restart allowed message has been 
            received from Y, X stops T25 or T28, whichever is 
            running, and restarts traffic on the link set to Y.  
            X gives MTP-RESUME primitives to users concerning Y 
            and any destinations made accessible via Y.  If X 
            has the transfer function it also broadcasts 
            transfer-allowed or transfer-restricted messages 
            concerning the same destinations.
         
         6. If T28 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
            to Y as in (5), unless a traffic restart allowed 
            message has not been sent to Y.  In that case, X 
            starts T25 and completes the sending of transfer 
            prohibited and transfer-restricted messages, 
            followed by a traffic restart allowed message.  
            Then, unless a traffic restart waiting message has 
            been received from Y without a subsequent traffic 
            restart allowed message, X stops 25 and restarts 
            traffic on the link set to Y.
         
         7. If T25 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
            toward Y.  In the abnormal case when X has not 
            completed sending transfer-prohibited and 
            transfer-restricted messages to Y, X completes 
            sending the transfer-prohibited messages required by 
            13.2.2 (1) and sends a traffic restart allowed 
            message before restarting user traffic.
         
         8. If no traffic restart allowed message has been 
            received from Y when traffic is restarted to Y, 
            timer T9 (see 9.4) is started.
         
         When signalling point Y becomes accessible via a route 
         other than a direct link set between X and Y, X sends a 
         MTP-RESUME primitive concerning Y to all local MTP 
         users.  In addition, if signalling point X has the 
         transfer function, X sends to Y any required 
         transfer-prohibited and transfer-restricted message by 
         the available route and broadcasts transfer-allowed or 
         transfer-restricted messages concerning Y."

        "This object specifies the duration of the ANSI traffic

         started when the first link in a direct link set

         This timer value and associated procedure is only in

         ANSI T1.111.4/2000 9.3 (Actions in Signalling Point X 
         Adjacent to a Restarting Signalling Point Y.)  A 
         signalling point X considers that the MTP of an 
         inaccessible adjacent signalling point Y is restarting 
         when:
         
         1. The first link in a direct link set is in the in 
            service state at level 2, or
         
         2. A route other than a direct link set becomes 
            available, e.g., through receipt of a transfer 
            allowed or traffic restart allowed message or the 
            availability of the corresponding link set.
         
         When the first link in a direct link set toward the 
         restarting signalling point Y goes into the in service 
         state at level 2, signalling point X begins taking into 
         account any traffic restart waiting, traffic restart 
         allowed, transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, and 
         transfer-allowed messages from Y.  Signalling point X 
         starts timer T28 either when the first link goes into 
         the in services state at level 2 or when the first 
         signalling link becomes available at level 3.  In 
         addition, it takes the following actions:
         
         1. If a TRW message is received from Y while T28 is 
            running or before it is started, X starts T25.  X 
            stops T28 if it is running.
         
         2. If a TRW message is received from Y while T25 is 
            running, X restarts T25.
         
         3. When the first link in a link set to Y becomes 
            available, signalling point X sends to Y a traffic 
            restart allowed message or, if X has the transfer 
            function, a traffic restart waiting message followed 
            by transfer-prohibited (note that all 
            transfer-prohibited messages according to 13.2.2 (1) 
            must be sent) and transfer restricted messages and a 
            traffic restart allowed message.
         
         4. If a destination becomes prohibited, restricted, or 
            available at X, after X has sent a traffic restart 
            allowed message to Y, X notifies Y of the status 
            change by the normal procedures in Section 13.
         
         5. When a traffic restart allowed message has been sent 
            to Y and a traffic restart allowed message has been 
            received from Y, X stops T25 or T28, whichever is 
            running, and restarts traffic on the link set to Y.  
            X gives MTP-RESUME primitives to users concerning Y 
            and any destinations made accessible via Y.  If X 
            has the transfer function it also broadcasts 
            transfer-allowed or transfer-restricted messages 
            concerning the same destinations.
         
         6. If T28 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
            to Y as in (5), unless a traffic allowed message has 
            not been sent to Y.  In that case, X starts T25 and 
            completes the sending of transfer-prohibited and 
            transfer-restricted messages, followed by a traffic 
            restart allowed message.  Then, unless a traffic 
            restart waiting message has been received from Y 
            without a subsequent traffic restart allowed 
            message, X stops T25 and restarts traffic on the 
            link set to Y.
         
         7. If T25 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
            toward Y.  In the abnormal case when X has not 
            completed sending transfer-prohibited and 
            transfer-restricted messages to Y, X completes 
            sending the transfer-prohibited messages required by 
            13.2.2 (1) and sends a traffic restart allowed 
            message before restarting user traffic.
         
         8. If no traffic restart allowed message has been 
            received from Y when traffic is restarted to Y, 
            timer T29 (see 9.4) is started.
         
         When signalling point Y becomes accessible via a route 
         other than a direct link set between X and Y, X sends 
         an MTP-RESUME primitive concerning Y to all local MTP 
         users.  In addition, if signalling point X has the 
         transfer function, X sends to Y any required 
         transfer-prohibited and transfer-restricted messages by 
         the available route and broadcasts transfer-allowed or 
         transfer-restricted messages concerning Y."

         When timer T11 expires or the lower priority route

         first), signalling transfer point Y notifies accessible

         points that receive a transfer-prohibited message 
         according to 13.2.2 (1) and except destination X if it 
         is an adjacent point.  Timer T18 is started after the 
         broadcast is complete.  If the failure is still present 
         and T18 expires, a transfer-restricted message is sent 
         once per incoming link or link set by signalling 
         transfer point Y in response to a message for 
         destination X.
         
         As a network option, the rate that transfer-restricted 
         messages are broadcast may be regulated to minimize the 
         burst of traffic that can occur due to controlled 
         rerouting in adjacent nodes.  This regulation is not

           sent before normal User traffic is carried.  This 
           might be done during or after phase 2.

           end of MTP restart is sent to all local MTP Users 
           showing each signalling point's accessibility or 
           inaccessibility.  The means of doing the latter is

         This timer value and associated procedure is only 
         applicable to ANSI based signalling protocol variants.
         
         ANSI T1.111.4/20000 9.2 ... When the first signalling 
         link goes into the in service state at level 2, the 
         restarting signalling point begins taking into account 
         any transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, 
         transfer-allowed, traffic restart allowed, and traffic 
         restart waiting messages received.  The restarting 
         point starts timers T22 and T26 either when the first 
         signalling link goes into the in service state at level 
         2 or when the first signalling link becomes available 
         at level 3.  When a traffic restart waiting message is 
         received before user traffic is restarted on the 
         link(s) to the point that sent the traffic restart 
         waiting message, timer T25 is started and user traffic 
         is not restarted on that link set until after a traffic 
         restart allowed message is received or timer T25 
         expires (see 9.3).
         
         When the first signalling link of a signalling link set 
         is available, MTP message traffic terminating at the 
         far end of the signalling link set is immediately 
         restarted (see also 9.5), and a traffic restart waiting 
         message is sent to the point at the end of the link 
         set.
         
         Whenever timer T26 expires, the restarting signalling 
         point restarts timer T26 and broadcasts a traffic 
         restart waiting message to those adjacent signalling 
         points connected by an available link.
         
         T22 is stopped when sufficient links are available to 
         carry the expected signalling traffic: stopping T22 is 
         a management decision that may take into account 
         factors such as the known long term unavailability of 
         certain signalling links because of equipment failures.
         
         When T22 is stopped or expires, the signalling point 
         starts a timer T23, during which it expects to receive 
         additional transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, 
         transfer-allowed (see Section 13), traffic restart 
         waiting, and traffic restart allowed messages.  When 
         traffic restart allowed message have been received for 
         all available links or the management function 
         determines that sufficient traffic restart allowed 
         messages have been received that the expected traffic 
         can be handled, T23 is stopped.
         
         IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:- T22 is used to place an upper 
         limit on the availability of sufficient signalling 
         links to handle the expected load.  A good rule of 
         thumb would be that when at least half of the 
         signalling links in each signalling link set are 
         available, that there are sufficient links available to 
         handle traffic; however, this does not include the 
         knowledge of long term failures.  Note that T22 is set 
         to about 10 minutes, and it would be really bad if 
         there was a signalling link set will long term link 
         failures that kept it below the rule of thumb causing 
         the restart to take longer than 10 minutes.  Therefore 
         a better rule of thumb might be that half the 
         signalling links are either active or management 
         blocked or in link oscillation lockout.  With reference 
         to ITU, this is still Restart Phase 1 and the next 
         phase is also Restart Phase 1."

         ANSI T1.111.4/2000 9.2 ... When T23 is stopped or 
         expires, the signalling point starts a timer T24, 
         during which it broadcasts transfer-prohibited and 
         transfer-restricted messages (see Section 13), taking 
         into account signalling links which are not available 
         and at least those transfer prohibited, 
         transfer-restricted and transfer-allowed message that 
         were received before T23 expired or was stopped.  
         Before user traffic is restarted, preventative 
         transfer-prohibited messages according to 13.2.2 (1) 
         must be sent.  Whether these preventative 
         transfer-prohibited messages are sent for all routes or 
         only for alternate routes is a network option.  When 
         the broadcast of transfer-prohibited and 
         transfer-restricted messages is completed, timer T24 is 
         stopped.
         
         IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:- In ANSI T22 and T23 are similar 
         to ITU-T T18.  After expiry of T23 or T18, the 
         broadcast of transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted 
         and transfer-allowed messages begins.  ANSI starts T24 
         in the same way that ITU-T (use to) starts T19.  ANSI 
         T26 is the overall timer that is roughly equivalent to 
         ITU T20 (T26 rebroadcasts TRW during the entire restart 
         period)."

-- notifications that cannot be represented by a 
-- communicationsAlarm.  It is the view of the OpenSS7 Project

         When a signalling link failure occurs, an 
         ss7OnOccurenceEvent notification is generated with this 
         object as the ProbableCause and the failed signalling 
         link as the objectInstance.  The specificProblems 
         object identifier is included in the message which 
         indicates the reason for the failure, as follows:
         
         - When the signalling link failed due to receipt of an 
           abnormal FIB or BSN, the abnormalFIBRorBSNR object 
           identity will be placed in the specific problem.  In 
           this case the notification corresponds to a Table 
           1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure - All reasons) and 1.3 (SL 
           failure - Abnormal FIBR/BSNR) on occurrence 
           notifiction.
         
         - When the signalling link failed due to excessive 
           delay of acknowledgement, or T7 timeout, the 
           excessiveAckDelay object identity will be placed in 
           the specific problem.  In this case the notification 
           corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure - All 
           reasons) and 1.4 (SL failure - Excessive delay of 
           ack) on occurence notification.
         
         - When the signalling link failed due to excessive 
           error rate, or the error count surpassing the 
           threshold in the SUERM or EIM, the excessiveErrorRate 
           object identity will be placed in the specific 
           problem.  In this case the notification corresponds 
           to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure - All reasons) and 
           1.5 (SL failure - Excessive error rate) on ocurence 
             notification.
         
         - When the signalling link failed due to excessive 
           duration of congestion (i.e, Timer T6 expiry), the 
           excessiveCongDuration object identity will be placed 
           in the specific problem.  In this case the 
           notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL 
           failure - All reasons) and 1.6 (SL failure - 
           Excessive duration of congestion) on occurrence 
           notification.
         
         - When the signalling link failed due to a reason other 
           than the above, or the reason cannot be determined, 
           no object identity is placed in the specific 
           problems.  In this case, the notification corresponds 
           to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure - All reasons) on 
           occurence notification.
         
         - When the signalling link is restored (versus 
           intialized) this proabable cause with the perceived 
           severity of cleared(5) will be issued complete with 
           the objectPointer identifying the restored link.  In 
           this case the notification corresponds to Table 
           1/Q.752 1.12 (SL restoration).
         
         For signalling link failures, the perceivedSeverity 
         included in the message is warning(1), minor(2), 
         major(3) or critical(4).  The failure of a signalling 
         link is considered a minor alarm event.  If the loss of 
         the signalling link results in the failure of a link 
         set, or other failures such as route set failures, a 
         separate major(3) alarm will be generated for the 
         correlated failure.  Additional information that must 
         be placed in the alarm assertion is the objectPointer 
         of the signalling link in question."

--  Notification objects (scalars) for use in notifications.

-- The TMN (Q.751.1) way of providing on-occurrence events from

-- as a communicationsAlarm (that is, it contains the same 
-- information as a communications alarm).  That approach is 
-- duplicated here to limit the number of unique notifications 
-- necessary to represent all of the events to one, which also

    DESCRIPTION 
        "The nuber of signalling link congestion indications, 
         first and delta.
         
         The signalling link congestion refers to link status 
         congested at level 3.  A link is marked at level 3 as 
         congested when a congestion threshold is reacehd at the 
         transmit side (see 3.6/T1.111.4 on Signalling Newtork 
         Congestion cluase 11 on Signalling Traffic Flow 
         Control).  Measurements should be kept for thresholds 
         1, 2, and 3 separately if that national option is 
         selected.  NOTE - The reporting of this item on 
         occurrent should be considered carefully, since there 
         might be many events in a short interval.  This might 
         occur for example if the congestion onset and abatement 
         thresholds were close together, or if the 
         transmission/retransmission buffer size were 
         significantly greater than the reception buffer at the 
         other end of the link, and congestion occurred."
