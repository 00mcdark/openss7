	DESCRIPTION
		"MIB Module for SS7 MTP management.

		 This MIB is based heavily on TMN (ITU-T Rec. X.721 (1992)) and the SS7 GDMOs 
		 (ITU-T Rec. Q.751.1 and ANSI T1.116.1).  It also includes statistics, alarms, 
		 notifications and operational measurements from ITU-T Q.752 (1997) and ANSI 
		 T1.116.2/2000.

		 The MIB uses the following containment principles:

		 -   A newtork contains zero or more signalling points

		 -   All objects other than a network and a signalling point are contained at 
		     some level within a signalling point.

		 -   A routeset is contained directly within a signalling point.  A route set 
		     can be to a remote signalling point to can be to an adjacent signalling 
		     point.  Adjacent signalling points can be one of the types provided by the 
		     SpType textual convention.

		 -   A routeset can contain zero or more route lists.  A route list contains one 
		     ore more routes.   A route is a path to a remote or adjacent signalling 
		     point code via a direct link set to (possibly another) signalling point 
		     code.  Routes in a route list have the same routing priority within the 
		     routeset and are candidates for load sharing.

		 -   A combined link set is a set of direct link sets to adjacent signalling 
		     points that are related as described in Q.704.   For example, the direct 
		     link sets to two STPs in an associated pair form a combined link set.  
		     Links that make up a combined link set are candidates for load sharing.

		 -   A link set is a collection of signalling links whose remote termination 
		     points terminate on the same signalling point code.

		 -   A signalling link is a collection of a signalling data link providing the 
		     facility and a signalling terminal providing the access to the signalling 
		     data link media.

		 -   A signalglin terminal is associated with a piece of physical equipement or 
		     software.

		 -   A signalling data link is associated with a piece of physical equipment or 
		     software.

-- The TMN (Q.751.1) way of providing on-occurrence events from Q.752 notifications is to provide a 
-- special ss7OnOccurenceEvent notification which performs double duty as a communicationsAlarm 
-- (that is, it contains the same information as a communications alarm).  That approach is 
-- duplicated here to limit the number of unique notifications necessary to represent all of the 
-- events to one, which also provides alarms.

--  NOTE: ANSI T1.116.1/2000 takes a somewhat different approach to notifications than does 
--  ITU-T Q.751.1: Whereas ITU-T defines an ss7OnOccurrenceEvent notification that has the same 
--  parameteres as a communicationsAlarm notification with some additional parameters for on 
--  occurence events not covered by communicationsAlarm, ANSI uses the communicationsAlarm for 
--  all events that can be accomodated by the alarm and uses ss7OnOccurenceEvent only for those 
--  notifications that cannot be represented by a communicationsAlarm.  It is the view of the 
--  OpenSS7 Project that the ANSI approach is somewhat superior in that all communicationsAlarms 
--  are better integrated into a single mechanism.

q752Item1p02 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { mtpSpecificExtensions 102 }

slFailure OBJECT-IDENTITY
	STATUS		current
	DESCRIPTION
		"This object identity is used with ProbableCause.  Probable Cause = 102 
		 (slFailure) which represents measurement Q.752/1.2 measurement Q.752/1.6 
		 (SpecificProblems = 003 abnormalFIBRorBSNR, 004 excessiveAckDelay, 005 
		 excessiveErrorRate, 006 excessiveCong Duration) and Q.752/1.12 (Perceived 
		 Severity = Cleared).

		 When a signalling link failure occurs, an ss7OnOccurenceEvent notification is 
		 generated with this object as the ProbableCause and the failed signalling link 
		 as the objectInstance.  The specificProblem object identifier is included in 
		 the message which indicates the reason for the failure, as follows:

		 -  When the signalling link failed due to receipt of an abnormal FIB or BSN, 
		    the abnormalFIBRorBSNR object identity will be placed in the specific 
		    problem.  In this case the notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 
		    (SL failure - All reasons) and 1.3 (SL failure - Abnormal FIBR/BSNR) on 
		    occurrence notifiction.

		 -  When the signalling link failed due to excessive delay of acknowledgement, 
		    or T7 timeout, the excessiveAckDelay object identity will be placed in the 
		    specific problem.  In this case the notification corresponds to a Table 
		    1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure - All reasons) and 1.4 (SL failure - Excessive delay 
		    of ack) on occurence notification.

		 -  When the signalling link failed due to excessive error rate, or the error 
		    count surpassing the threshold in the SUERM or EIM, the excessiveErrorRate 
		    object identity will be placed in the specific problem.  In this case the 
		    notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure - All reasons) 
		    and 1.5 (SL failure - Excessive error rate) on ocurence notification.
		 
		 -  When the signalling link failed due to excessive duration of congestion 
		    (i.e, Timer T6 expiry), the excessiveCongDuration object identity will be 
		    placed in the specific problem.  In this case the notification corresponds 
		    to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 (SL failure - All reasons) and 1.6 (SL failure - 
		    Excessive duration of congestion) on occurrence notification.

		 -  When the signalling link failed due to a reason other than the above, or the 
		    reason cannot be determined, no object identity is placed in the specific 
		    problems.  In this case, the notification corresponds to a Table 1/Q.752 1.2 
		    (SL failure - All reasons) on occurence notification.

		 -  When the signalling link is restored (versus intialized) this proabable 
		    cause with the perceived severity of cleared(5) will be issued complete with 
		    the objectPointer identifying the restored link.  In this case the 
		    notification corresponds to Table 1/Q.752 1.12 (SL restoration).

		 For signalling link failures, the perceivedSeverity included in the message is 
		 warning(1), minor(2), major(3) or critical(4).  The failure of a signalling 
		 link is considered a minor alarm event.  If the loss of the signalling link 
		 results in the failure of a link set, or other failures such as route set 
		 failures, a separate major(3) alarm will be generated for the correlated 
		 failure.  Additional information that must be placed in the alarm assertion is 
		 the objectPointer of the signalling link in question."

		 automatic changeover of a signalling link and local automatic changeback of a 
		 signalilng link in accordance with Table 1/Q.752 1.10 (Local automatic 
		 changeover) and 1.11 (Local automatic changeback).

		 -  When used to indicate local automatic changeover, perceivedSeverity will 
		    have values warning(1), minor(2), major(3) or critical(4).  In this case the 
		    notification corresponds to Table 1/Q.752 1.10 or Table 1/T1.116.1 1.10 
		    (Local automatic changeover).

		 -  When used to indicate local automatic changeback, perceivedSeverity will 
		    contain cleared(5).  In this case the notification corresponds to Table 
		    1/Q.752 1.11 or Table 1/T1.116.1 1.11 (Local automatic changeback).

		 For automatic link changeovers, the perceivedSeverity included in the message 
		 is warning(1), minor(2), major(3) or critical(4).  The automatic changeover of 
		 a signalling link is considered a minor alarm event as it derives directly from 
		 from a signalling link failure, also considered a minor event.  The fact that 
		 an automatic changeover has occurred just means that the signalling links was 
		 carrying traffic when it failed, or that a remote processour outage was of a 
		 long duration.

-- NOTE: Q.751.1 only associates timeouts for T6, T8 and T10 with a link set.  This does not make must

-- is a trasnfer prohibited inhibition timer which should be provisioned on a route-set (or route)
-- basis.  T10 is a route-set test message repeat timer that should be provisioned on a route-set
-- basis.  In the same vein, Q.751.1 does not allocate T7, T19 and T21 on a link set basis.  T7 should
-- clearly be on a link set basis as it has to do with the automatic allocation of signalling data
-- links and terminals between signalling points for a link set.  T19 and T21 can clearly be
-- provisioned on a link set basis as they have to do with restart procedures for the direct link set.
-- The ANSI equivalent timers T25, T28, T29 and T30 should be provisioned according to the same
-- reasoning.

-- Q.751.1 uses profile objects for timers.  I prefer to use inheritance as it provides more
-- opportunity for rational underspecification when establishing objects.  For example, if standard
-- timer values are used, it is never necessary to specify a timer when establishing any object.

		 together into least significant bits only the masked bits, comparing the modulo of
		 the masked bits with the number of link sets in the combined link set, and then
		 matching against the index numbers of the link sets.  So, for example, if there are 4
		 SLS bits (ITU-T case) and there are two links sets in the combined link set at index
		 positions 0 and 1, and the mask is '0100'B, then SLS values '0000'B, '0001'B,
		 '0010'B, '0011'B, '1000'B, '1001'B, '1010'B and '1011'B will be sent normally to the

	STATUS		current
	DESCRIPTION
		"Receive overruns are counted on the receiver between the line and the 
		 signalling data link terminating device.  This occurs whenever bits were able 
		 to be retrieved from the line, but the driver was too slow in accepting the 
		 previously received bit from the line, and the signalling data link receivers 
		 were forced to drop bits.  This should not occur in normal operation and this 
		 number should be low or zero and not increase after the first initialization of 
		 the signalling data link.  If this number is increasing, it indicates that 
		 there are significant latencies in some device driver which is performing too 
		 many functions with interrupts suppressed.  (Or the CPU is just too slow.)"

	DESCRIPTION
		"Receive buffer overflows occur between the signalling data link and the 
		 signalling terminal.  When the signalling data link driver goes to deliver data 
		 to the signalling terminal and a buffer to contain the data is not immediately 
		 available, a receive buffer overflow condition ensues.  Becuase of buffer 
		 recycling, this number should be low or zero and should not increase after the 
		 first initialization of the signalling data link.  If this number is 
		 increasing, it indicates that there are significant buffer or memory pressure 
		 issued or that there are significant latencies in some device driver which is 
		 performing too many functions with interrupts diabled.  (Or the CPU is just too 
		 slow.)"
