    DESCRIPTION
	"The purpose of this MIB is to proivde SNMP support for the TCAP 
	 operational measurements provided in ITU-T Q.752 and ANSI 
	 T1.116.  There exists a draft GDMO specification for ANSI 
	 T1.116.1 from which this MIB is based.  Strangely enough, no 
	 GDMO is standardized for SS7 operational measurements.

	 The objective of this MIB is to support both the reporting of 
	 statistics obtained from Operational Measurements as well as 
	 providing a mechanism to activate and report the results of OM 
	 studies."

-- 5 TC monitoring and measurements
-- 5.1 General
--
-- Table 13 describes the TC utilization measurements.
-- Table 14 describes the TC error performance and stability 
-- measurements.
--
-- 5.2 Table 13
-- TC utilization measurements are listed in Table 13.
--
-- 5.2.1 Item 13.7 is a count of all new transactions in the interval, 
-- including those closed immediately by an ABORT after the opening 
-- BEGIN.
--
-- Item 13.8 is a measurement of the mean number of open transactions in 
-- the interval.  An open transaction is one to which a transaction 
-- identity has been allocated, and this identity is not yet frozen.
--
-- Measurement 13.10 (the cummulative mean duration of transactions) is 
-- the mean duration for all transactions that began between the start 
-- of measurements and the end of the measurement interval.  It includes 
-- the time from opening the transaction to the end of the interval, for 
-- those transactions that did not close during the interval.  Here, the 
-- trasnaction duration ia defined as the time from allocation of the 
-- transaction identity to freezing it.
--
-- See clause 5.2.2 for more information.
--
-- 5.2.2  An example of collection of measurements
-- A model to describe the collection of Items 13.8 and 13.10, used to 
-- explain possible measurement techniques by which is not intended to 
-- specify implementation, is as follows:
--
-- Suppose a system collects measurements in a number 's' of 
-- 'measurement centres'.  A measurement centre can be defeind as a 
-- point in the system that launches, or observes directly the launching 
-- of, a TC transaction, and it also either finishes the transaction, or 
-- observes directly its passing.  This point is assumed also to be able 
-- to count the number of free, frozen and thawing transaction 
-- identities with which it is concerned.  Thus in a multiprocessor 
-- system, there might be one (or more) measurement centre(s) per 
-- processor per Application Entity definition, which is responsible for 
-- launching all the transactions (instances) of that Application 
-- Entity.  For mesaurements collected by all the centers to refer to 
-- the same interval, it is assumed that each centre has a clock which 
-- 'ticks' at a rate sufficiently high to be able to measure with the 
-- required precision.  The clocks are also assumed to be syncrhonized 
-- to within one clock tick (if they are not, further calculations would 
-- be needed to determin the overall precision).  If necessary, each 
-- centre would have an 'active' set of measurements, and another set 
-- taken in the previous measurement interval, which might be awaiting 
-- collection.
--
-- Measurement 13.8 is the mean number of open transactions, estimated 
-- over a measurement interval, observations are taken at each new 
-- transaction during the interval.
-- 
-- The measurements can be over the whole Application Entity, or at 
-- teach centre, and then accumulated for the whole Application Entity.
--
-- Define a cummulative total 'Ac' of open transactions (this is set to 
-- 0 at the start of each measurement interval), and define 'a' as the 
-- number of open transactions at any time.  'a' is set to 0 at system 
-- initialisation, it is incremented at each transaction arrival, and 
-- decremented when each transaction leaves.  Define 'n' as the number 
-- of new transactions arriving during the measurement interval (which 
-- is set to '0' at the start of each interval).
--
-- When a transaction arrives, set:
--
--	Ac = Ac + a; a = a + 1; n = n + 1;
--
-- When a transction finishes, set:
--
--	a = a - 1;
--
-- When the reporting event occurs at the end of the measurement 
-- interval, report 'Ac', 'n' and 'a'.  Then initialize 'Ac' and 'n' to 
-- 0.
--
-- The mean number of open transactions during the interval for this 
-- measurement center is 'Ac/n', for several centers use the expression 
-- SUM(Ac)/SUM(n).
--
-- Item 13.10, the cummulative mean duration of transactions, requires 
-- that those transactions that were open at the start of measurements 
-- (but not those open at the start of the interval), be excluded from 
-- the measurements.  (It would be possible to include those open at the 
-- start of measurements, if some estimate of their age could be made, 
-- but for simplicity this is not considered here.)  To do this, the 
-- transaction record itself needs an indicator equal to an overall 
-- (measurement center) value set when measurements start, and unset 
-- when measurements finish, to exclude transactions that started before 
-- measurements did.
--
-- For this measurement, the following variables are kept at each 
-- measurement centre:
--
--  - A running cummulative transaction length time 'Tc'.  This is set to 
--    0 at the start of measurements, but is kept running during the 
--    successive measurement intervals.
--
--  - A cummulative transaction arrival counter 'Rc'.  This is 
--    initialized at the start of measurements, and is kept running 
--    during the successive measurement intervals.
--
--  - A counter 'time' which is set to 0 at the start of measurements, 
--    and is incremented by 1 for each clock tick.
--
-- The measurement is performed as follows:
--
--  1. when a transaction arrives, set 'Tc = Tc - time; Rc = Rc + 1;'
--
--  2. when a transaction finishes, if it started at or after the start 
--     of measurements, set 'Tc = Tc + time;'
--
--  3. at the end of the measurement interval, report 'Tc', 'Rc' and use 
--     'a' from item 13.8 (but with 'a' initialized at the start of 
--     measurements).  The mean duration of transactions measured in 
--     this interval is (Tc + a.time)/Rc for the centre, with 
--     appropriate extensions for the overall mean.
--
-- A possible alternative measurement could be the mean duration of new 
-- transaction occuring in the interval (providing those transaction 
-- open at the start of the interval, and long transactions, where 
-- catered-for separately).  If this were required, then some form of 
-- 'phase' indication would be required to be kept in each transaction 
-- record, sot that the finished of a 'new' transaction could be 
-- distinguished from the finish of a transaction that was open at teh 
-- start of the interval.  Then 'Tc', 'Rc', 'time' and 'a' would be kept 
-- relative to the interval, with them all set to 0 at its start.
--
-- 5.3  Table 14
-- TC error performance and stability measurements are listed in Table 
-- 14.  Measurements with detailed reasons can be found in Annex A, 
-- these are more appropriate during development of a service, rather 
-- than for operational use.
--
-- 5.3.1  Measurements 14.4 e) (resource limitation) can indicate a 
-- local TC resource problem, and requires the maintenance staff to be 
-- notified.
--
-- Measurement 14.4 d) (unrecognized transaction identity) might 
-- indicate problems of an operational nature.  Possible examples are:
--
-- - because of SCCP routing problems, the local TC has received a 
--   message for a transcation that never existed;
--
-- - messages arriving for transactions that have timed-out and been 
--   closed by the application.
--
-- To allow the source of the error to be traced, the originating 
-- address of the received message should be logged to for later 
-- retrieval.
--
-- At the first report, sufficient information should be provided to 
-- establish the fault's location.
--
-- 6.5  Transaction Capabilities (TCs)
-- 6.5.1 TC fault management measurements
-- Problem isolation during development may be assisted by measurements 
-- that indicate the reason for protocol error being reported.
--
-- Measurements (those of which are not of resource limitation are in 
-- Annex A)
--
-- - protocol error detected in transaction portion (Items 14.1 a) to e) 
--   and 14.4 a) to e));
-- - protocol error detected in component portion (Iterms 14.2 a) to h) 
--   and 14.5 a) to h));
-- - TC user generated problems (Items 14.3 a) to k) and 14.6 a) to k));
--
-- During operation, resource limtation measurements 14.1 e), 14.3 d), 
-- 14.4 e) and 14.6 d) are pertinent.  Also, items 14.7 through 14.11 
-- are counts for protocol errors, and provide a summary for these items 
-- in Annex A.
--
-- The purpose of these measurements is to monitor abnormal events of an 
-- operational nature, or peaks in errors that affect the quality of 
-- service offered to the TC users.  They also provide the means to 
-- collect additional information that allows the source of the errors 
-- to be traced.  To this end, a log of notifications which is 
-- retrievable on command (e.g. from an Operations System) could be 
-- kept.
--
-- Measurements 14.3 d) and 14.6 d) (resource limitations) indicate TC 
-- user resource problems when processing an invoked operation.  They 
-- are included in the TC measurements as they might be applciable to a 
-- number of different TC users.
--
-- 6.5.2  TC performance
-- The loading of TC resources may be indicated through the volume of 
-- messages and components handled.  They dynamic loading of TC 
-- resources can be observed by counting the number of new transactions 
-- during an interval, the mean number of open transactions during an 
-- interval indicates the static loading of TC.  The cummulative mean 
-- duration of transactions can be used for dimensioning TC an TC user 
-- resources, and to indicate operational problems.
--
-- Measurements
-- - total number of TC messages sent by the node (by message type) 
--   (item 13.1);
-- - total number of TC message received by the node (by message type) 
--   (item 13.2);
-- - total number of components sent by the node (item 13.3);
-- - total number of components received by the node (item 13.4);
-- - number of new transactions during an interval (item 13.6);
-- - mean number of open transactions during an interval (item 13.7);
-- - cummulative mean duration of transactions (item 13.9);
-- - maximum number of open transcation during an interval (item 13.10).
--
-- Also, an Operations System can use a measurement to activate this set 
-- of measurements:
-- - a report when the number of open transactions is greater than a 
--   pre-defined threshold (iterm 13.11).
--
-- Items 13.10 and 13.11 are equivalent to the X.738 minMaxScanner and 
-- Q.822 gaugeThreshold respectively, but they utilize an internal 
-- counter per Application Entity that is not itself reported, and hence 
-- is not given as a measurement (this is the current number of open 
-- transaction identities for which a 'snapshot' of open transactions at 
-- the measurement time is not necessarily representative of the 
-- performance of Application Entity's transactions throughout the 
-- measurement interval).  For an example of a possible method of 
-- implementing these measurements, see 5.2.1.
