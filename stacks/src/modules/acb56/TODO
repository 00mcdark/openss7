Things to do...

o   The old ACB56 SDL driver is no long applicable.  We have moved the SDL
    interface down to the channel level.  An SDL ACB56 driver should put the
    MPCC chip into a raw mode an pass bytes to the bit-punp soft-HDLC used in
    the X400P-SS7 driver or implemented in the SDT module.

o   A new ACB56 SDT level driver is under development.  The SL module could be
    pushed over this driver to implement a Signalling Link.

o   A new ACB56 SL level driver could be written.
