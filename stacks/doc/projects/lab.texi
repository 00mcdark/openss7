@node Executive Overview
@unnumbered Executive Overview

This document provides a High Level Design and development proposal for a SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security
Network configuration for experimentation with signalling system security.  The initial and primary
purpose of this equipment is to perform high-volume load testing and security analysis in the
laboratory environment.  As such, the data sets that are used to populate the LAB can be constrained
to a degree permitting high-performance from a small footprint, open source software and commodity
hardware solution.

@subsubheading The OpenSS7 Project

The @uref{http://www.openss7.org/, OpenSS7 Project} is an open source software project that has
developed many protocol components within the SS7, SIGTRAN, ISDN and VoIP protocol stacks.
Intellectual property rights for the OpenSS7 Project are held by @uref{http://www.openss7.com/,
OpenSS7 Corporation}.  All OpenSS7 Project software is eventually licensed under the GNU Public
License Version 2.  OpenSS7 Corporation also provide commercial licensing of OpenSS7 Project
software under terms less restrictive than the GPL.

@subsubheading SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network

OpenSS7 can provide SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network capabilities in a high-performance, low-cost,
small-footprint platform leveraging the GNU/Linux operating system distributions and tools, and
utilizing low-cost commodity hardware.

@subsubheading Open Source Software

The OpenSS7 Project leverages the widespread use of GNU/Linux operation systems, distributions, and
FSF tools such as @samp{autoconf} and @dfn{RPM}.  For example, this document was formatted for PDF,
HTML, info and plain text using the GNU @dfn{texinfo} system, @samp{autoconf}, and the @TeX{}
formatting system.

The open source model avoids proprietary lock-in and permits in-house or outsourced development.
All source code is available for use and modification by the end customer.  All build tools,
documentation and associated resources are generally available.  The availability of the source code
and complete documentation eases problem resolution and can offer upgrades and fixes even in advance
of client problem reports.  

@subsubheading Commodity Hardware

By best utilizing commodity PC or standardized CompactPCI hardware, OpenSS7 makes available the
highest performance platforms available on the market at back-to-school prices.  When carrier-grade
is not essential, 3GHz Pentium class servers in hardened rack mount chassis can be used at a
fraction of the cost, and yet outperform, other solutions.  Where carrier-grade is necessary,
embedded Linux on standardized CompactPCI NEBS compliant chassis make for a higher cost, but more
reliable alternative.

@subsubheading Rapid Development

The OpenSS7 Project has already developed protocol components completing the SS7 and SIGTRAN
signalling stacks including MTP Level 2 and Level 3, ISUP, SCCP, TCAP; and SCTP, M2PA, M2UA, M3UA,
SUA and TUA.  Development of an SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network to meet laboratory experimentation
needs only the integration of load generating and failed call detection.

@subsubheading An Evolving Solution

The OpenSS7 Project is evolving to support more protocol stacks including ISDN and VoIP.  Support
for an ever expanding capability is demonstrated by the additional options available.

@subsubheading Conclusions

In summary, a high-performance platform for testing the security of SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP platforms in
the laboratory is an excellent application of the OpenSS7 SS7, SIGTRAN and VoIP stacks and can be
provided at a affordable price on short time-lines, while offering an evolution path for future test
or deployment applications.

@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
@cindex Introduction

This document provides a High-Level Design and Project Proposal for an OpenSS7 platform to provide a
high-performance, instrumented SS7 and SIGTRAN capabilities.  The primary driver for this
High-Performance SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network is to provide a system that will load ISUP call
completions and detect missed or failed calls for the purposes of experimentation concerning the
security of commercial SS7, SIGTRAN and VoIP stacks.  The document provides a High-Level Design and
Proposal for a instrumented laboratory system to provide this capability.

The proposal utilizes, where possible, existing OpenSS7 SS7, SIGTRAN and VoIP stack components and
provides a development plan for components that are specific to the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security
Network requirements.

This document discusses the resulting software configuration that will be put in place on the
production system, the platform configuration for the production system, and a lab network
configuration for evaluation.  Also discussed is an overview of the project management logistics for
successful completion over the course of this development project.

It is intended that this document be a ``living'' document, that is updated over the course of this
development project.

@section SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network
@cindex SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network

This project provides an High Performance SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP security testing platform that accepts
and responds to high volume ISUP call completions.

@section Project Drivers
@cindex Project drivers

The lead purpose of the High-Performance SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network is to provide a
high-performance PSTN sub-network to provide the ISUP call setup function for high-volume load
testing of PSTN implementations in client laboratories.  The for use of experimentation with the
platform will be investigation of the security of a commercial SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP implementation.

@section Scope
@cindex Scope

Because of its laboratory installation, initially the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network is
constructed using commodity computing platforms and PCI based hardware cards.  This will initially
result in a non-carrier grade system for low cost in the test lab environment.  For production
SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP platforms, carrier grade options are available but more costly.

It is questionable whether a carrier-grade platform (reliability and availability) is necessary in
the laboratory environment.  Carrier-grade hardware, such as PCMIG 2.15 CompactPCI cards with
duplicated facilities, fail-over and self-healing neither increases nor decreases the security of the
resulting system.  Of more importance than availability is the capacity of the system to handle ISUP
call generation and completion during test runs.

@node System Requirements
@chapter System Requirements
@cindex System Requirements

This section discusses SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network system requirements generated by the need
for testing of security frameworks present within the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

It should be noted that UNT has not written even a high-level requirements document for the
instrumentation required for experimentation.  The requirements in the sections that follow derive
from discussions with Dr. Ram Dantu of UNT and consideration of the paper @cite{SS7 over IP:
Signaling Interworking Vulnerabilities}.

@node Experimentation Objectives
@section Experimentation Objectives
@cindex Experimentation Objectives

@figref{1} illustrates one network node configuration discussed in the paper @cite{SS7 over IP:
Signaling Interworking Vulnerabilities} from the SS7 network perspective.

@figure{lab000,1,Network Architecture}

@figref{1} shows two demarcation points for interconnection.  A Point-of-Presence (POP) occurs at
the facilities between interconnected SSPs.  The precise POP demarcation point is largely arbitrary
as far as security is concerned.  A Signalling Point of Interface (SPOI) occurs either across the
B/D-Links interconnecting STP associated pairs (indicated by dotted line (B)), or across the
A/E-Links interconnecting the SSP to the SS7 network (indicated by dotted line (A)).

The SSP on the right of @figref{1} can be further decomposed according to the SIGTRAN and TIPHON
architectures as illustrated in @figref{2} and @figref{3}.

@figure{lab005,2,SSP Decomposition - Demarcation B}

As illustrated in @figref{2}, the SIGTRAN decomposition of the SSP at interconnection point (B)
utilizes a pair of Signalling Gateways (SGs) that act as an associated pair of Signalling Transfer
Points (STPs) to the SS7 network.  The Media Gateway Controller (MGC) provides SSP call control
functions and acts as an ASP toward the SGs within the SIGTRAN network.  SUA, M3UA, M2UA or M2PA
SIGTRAN protocols can be used.

@figure{lab006,3,SSP Decomposition - Demarcation A}

As illustrated in @figref{3}, the SIGTRAN decomposition of the SSP at interconnection point (A)
utilizes a single Signalling Gateway (SG) that acts as a signalling end point (SEP) to the SS7
network.  The Media Gateway Controller (MGC) provides SSP call control functions and acts as an ASP
toward the SG within the SIGTRAN network.  SUA, M3UA, M2UA (but not M2PA) SIGTRAN protocols can be
used.

Typically, the networks labelled as @dfn{VoIP Control Network} in @figref{2} and @figref{3} is a
secured private network.  Although the networks labelled as @dfn{VoIP Signalling Network} and
@cite{VoIP Bearer Network} might be directly connected to the public Internet, they likely are not
in real situations.  Normally an H.323 GK or SIP Proxy and firewalls would stand between the
@cite{VoIP Signalling Network} and a public Internet or even a private network attached ultimately
to a public Internet.  Normally a NAT, IP Proxy or Firewall would stand between the @dfn{VoIP Bearer
Network} and a public Internet or even a private network attached ultimately to a public Internet.

@node Experimental Approach
@section Experimental Approach
@cindex Experimental Approach

The experimental approach is to provide a network environment that behaves much the same as the
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) in regard to the processing of calls and the functional
platforms and logical nodes provided.  Commercial implementations of protocols and call processing
functions will be used where possible.  This captive network environment will be instrumented and
will carry a high volume of call traffic in the same manner as a typical deployment within the PSTN.
Experiments will be run in attempting to attack the system using the techniques documented in the
paper: @cite{SS7 over IP: Signaling Interworking Vulnerabilities}.

Note that the use of real MGs, IMTs (Inter-Machine Trunks) and RTP channels for high traffic volumes
is cost prohibitive.  Costs approaching that of the PSTN itself would result.  Call emulation
consisting of the signalling components without the actual bearer-channel facilities can provide
large-scale signalling traffic approaching that of a large network provider without the cost of the
physical trunks.  Also, the security of the MEGACO/H.248 or MGCP protocols is not the subject of
current investigations.

@node Experiment Requirements
@section Experiment Requirements
@cindex Experiment Requirements

In support of experimentation with signalling security, the following high-level requirements arise:

@enumerate
@item  The system should as closely as possible provide the configuration and capabilities found in
a large public network.
@item  The system must be able to sustain a high signalling load while performing experiments.
@item  Call traffic generators and acceptors need to be provided to simulate the call traffic load
of many subscribers in a large network.
@item  The system needs to be instrumented and call traffic monitors and audits provided for correct
completion and release of each call.  This is to assist in the determination of the results of a
given experiment.@footnote{That is, to determine, for example, how many call failures were caused by
a particular experiment, and the nature and extent of each failure.}
@end enumerate

The following efficiencies can be exploited:

@enumerate
@item
As the actual bearer channels are not the subject of current investigation@footnote{Current
investigation focusses on the signalling component and not the bearer component.}, an efficiency can
be gained by not physically providing the Inter-Machine Trunks (IMTs), Media Gateways (MGs) or RTP
channels necessary to provide the bearer capabilities for the generated traffic.

@item
Intra-switch traffic does not need to be generated; only inter-switch traffic.  Because intra-switch
traffic (some 80% of the call traffic experienced within the PSTN) does not expose itself as ISUP
SS7 signalling, it need not be simulated.  By not simulating intra-switch traffic, a PSTN
environment of five (5) times the scale or more can be accomplished with the same amount of
equipment.

@item
PSTN line-side interfaces and devices@footnote{An example of PSTN line-side device and interfaces
are ISDN basic rate or ISDN primary rate interfaces, and BRI ISDN sets and PRI NT1s are an example
of PSTN line-side devices.} do not need to be provided.  Traffic generation and acceptance can be
simulated with direct ISUP traffic generation and acceptance.

@item
ISUP protocol stacks provide a set of standard operational measurements that can be used to
instrument and monitor call completion and release.  Operations measurements include the number of
lost or abnormal calls, including the nature of the failure and diagnostic information.  This
information can be reused to instrument ISUP call processing within the test network in several
ways:

@enumerate
@item
Operational measurement statistics can be used to show the impact of an experiment on the ability of
the system to function normally.  Operational measurement statistics are an indicator of the health
of the system and are collected on an ongoing basis for all nodes.

@item
Operational measurement @dfn{studies}@footnote{An operational measurement study invokes the
collection of operational measurements not normally collected on a regular basis.} can be defined to
report the impact of specific experiments.

@item
Operational measurement alarms can be collected and used to indicate the level of maintenance and
security response by an operator to experiments.
@end enumerate

@end enumerate

@node Network Configuration
@chapter Network Configuration
@cindex Network Configuration

To satisfy the requirements for experimentation with the security of the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security
Network, the intention is for the laboratory system to provide a telecommunications sub-network and
environment that parallels the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).  The SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP
Security Network must provide a sub-network of the PSTN in which experiments can be performed.  To
accomplish this, the physical nodes in the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network provide emulation of
typical logical nodes in the PSTN.

@subsection Logical Network Nodes
@cindex Logical Network Nodes

To meet the requirements of PSTN experimentation, the logical nodes that need to be provided are as
follows:

@menu
* Service Switching Point (SSP)::
* Signalling Transfer Point (STP)::
* Signalling Gateway (SG)::
* Application Server Process (ASP)::
* Media Gateway Controller (MGC)::
* Media Gateway (MG)::
@end menu

@node Service Switching Point (SSP)
@subsubsection Service Switching Point (SSP)
@cindex Service Switching Point (SSP)

Service switching points (SSPs) are Switches (end-offices, tandem, toll) within the PSTN under the
SS7 signalling architecture.  These node initiate and terminate ISUP call connections.

SS7 signalling links (A/F-links) connect SSP to STP within the PSTN.  Service switching points within
the PSTN also terminate voice circuits for ISUP call connections.

Each physical node within the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network is capable of providing multiple logical

experimentation, it is not necessary to provide circuit connections for ISUP call bearer circuits.

@node Signalling Transfer Point (STP)
@subsubsection Signalling Transfer Point (STP)
@cindex Signalling Transfer Point (STP)

Signalling transfer poinrts (STPs) are signalling relay points within the PSTN under the SS7
signalling architecture.  These nodes neither initiate nor terminate ISUP call connections, but
transfer the signalling messages between SSPs that do.

SS7 signalling links (A/F-links) connect SSP to STP within the PSTN.  STPs are also connected to other
STPs using SS7 signalling links (B/C/D-links).  B/D-links are used to connect STPs together along the 
signalling transfer path.  C-links (or cross-links) are used to connected mated pairs of STPs
together to form redundant pairs of STPs.

Each physical node within the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network is capable of providing multiple
logical STPs, each with their own set of SS7 signalling links (B/C/D-links) connected into the SS7
signalling network.

@node Signalling Gateway (SG)
@subsubsection Signalling Gateway (SG)
@cindex Signalling Gateway (SG)

Signalling gateways (SGs) are interworking points to the PSTN under the SIGTRAN signalling
architecture.  These nodes neither initiate nor terminate ISUP call connections, but transfer and
inter-work signalling messages between the SS7 signalling network and the SIGTRAN IP network.

Signalling gateways (with the sole exception of M2PA) connect to the SS7 network using traditional
SS7 signalling links and connect to the IP network using typical network interfaces (e.g.
Ethernet).  Signalling gateways do not terminate ISUP call circuits within the SIGTRAN architecture.

Two types of signalling gateways are possible, distinguished by how the node appears logically
within the SS7 networks:

@enumerate
@item SG as SSP.
When a signalling gateway appears within the SS7 network as a service switching point (SSP), the
signalling gateway terminates A/F-links (SS7 signalling links) and presents the signalling point code
of a service switching point.
@item SG as STP.
When a signalling gateway appears within the SS7 network as a signalling transfer point (STP), the
signalling gateway terminates B/C/D-links (SS7 signalling links), are normally provisioned in mated pairs, and
present the signalling point code of a signalling transfer point (STP) and proxy virtual signalling
points (VSP) which are an emulated of A/F-link attached SSPs.
@end enumerate

Each physical node with the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network is capable of providing multiple
logical SGs of either type, each with their own set of SS7 signalling links (A/B/C/D/E/F-links) and
network interfaces or SCTP connections to the Internet Protocol network.

Operational measurements that are available for experiment result analysis are the complete set of
standard MTP statistics and events as indicated in
ITU-T Recommendation Q.752@footnote{Ibid.}.
There are no standard MIBs available for SIGTRAN protocols other than SCTP itself.

@node Application Server Process (ASP)
@subsubsection Application Server Process (ASP)
@cindex Application Server Process (ASP)

Application server processes (ASPs) are interworking points to the PSTN under the SIGTRAN signalling
architecture.  These nodes may initiate or terminate ISUP call connections.

Network interfaces (such as Ethernet) are used to connect ASPs to the SIGTRAN IP network, and ASPs
may terminate ISUP call bearer circuits.  ASPs do not have SS7 signalling links.

Each physical node within the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network is capable of providing multiple
logical ASPs, each with their own set of network interfaces or SCTP connections to the Internet
Protocol network, and each with their own set of ISUP call bearer circuits.

@node Media Gateway Controller (MGC)
@subsubsection Media Gateway Controller (MGC)
@cindex Media Gateway Controller (MGC)

Media gateway controllers (MGCs) are interworking points to the PSTN under the ETSI TIPHON
architecture.  These nodes neither initiate nor terminate ISUP call connections, but inter-work then
to SIP or H.323 calls external to the PSTN.

Media gateway controllers connect to the SS7 network using traditional SS7 signalling links
(normally A/F-links) and act like an tandem SSP (non-end-office) within the PSTN.  Media gateway
controls connect to the Internet Protocol network using network interfaces and form TCP or SCTP
connections within that network.  Media gateway controllers connect to Media Gateways (MGs) using
network interfaces and form TCP or SCTP connections within that network.  Media gateway controllers
neither terminate ISUP call bearer circuits nor RTP sessions.

Each physical node within the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network is capable of providing multiple
logical MGCs, each with their own set of SS7 signalling links and IP network interfaces or TCP/SCTP
connections.

Operational measurements that are available for experiment result analysis are the complete set of
standard MTP and ISUP statistics and events as indicated in
ITU-T Recommendation Q.752@footnote{Ibid.}.

@node Media Gateway (MG)
@subsubsection Media Gateway (MG)
@cindex Media Gateway (MG)

Media gateway controllers (MGs) are bearer channel inter-working points to the PSTN under the ETSI
TIPHON architecture.  These nodes neither initiate not terminate ISUP call connections, but
inter-work between the TDM-based ISUP call bearer circuits in the PSTN and ephemeral RTP sessions
within the IP network.

Although each physical SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network node is capable of providing multiple
logical MG functions, this function is not necessary to the investigation of signalling security.

@node Logical Node Configuration

To satisfy the requirements for experimentation, the proposed logical node configuration is chosen

@figref{4} shows the types of nodes within the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network, and an indication
of the @emph{number} of nodes within each type.  There are four types of nodes:

@table @emph
@item LEC service switching points (SSPs).

For the purposes of security testing, more than one logical LEC SSP will be provided.  The purpose
of providing multiple LEC SSPs is to be able to monitor any description of call traffic between LEC
SSP nodes.

In normal CO arrangements, LEC SSP call control is not connected to any publicly accessible IP
network (full air gap).  The only manner in which attackers (and thus realistic experiments) can
affect the operation of LEC SSPs is via the SS7 protocol.  Physical security of SSPs should be
considered separate from signalling system security.

Each LEC SSP is capable of providing varying degrees of screening on ISUP signalling on an trunk
group by trunk group basis.  Whether a call is routed or billed correctly depends upon LEC security
screening policy and policies with regards to software standards, translations, customer datafill,
MATELs and RCOs.  These aspects should be considered as separate from signalling system security.

@item LEC signalling transfer points (STPs).

For the purpose of security testing, one logical associated pair of LEC STPs will be provided.
Providing only one pair is consistent with the interconnect topology of relatively large LEC
networks.

In normal CO arrangements, LEC STPs are not connected to any publicly accessible IP network (full
air gap).  The only manner in which attackers (and thus realistic experiments) can affect the
operation of the LEC STP is via the SS7 protocol.  Physical security of STPs is, in practise, quite
high, and should be considered separate from signalling system security.

Each LEC STP is capable of providing Enhanced and Border Gateway Screening (EGWS/BGWS) applied on
any or all attached SS7 links.  In real networks, any STP associated pair to which an external
administration interconnects is so equipped and full screening is activated.

@item IC signalling transfer points (STPs).

For the purpose of security testing, one logical associated pair of IC STPs will be provided.
Providing only one pair is consistent with the interconnect topology of relatively large IC (e.g.
IXCs). 

In normal CO arrangements, interconnects employ similar security policies to that of the LEC, a
situation that is required for under FCC regulation.  It is not reasonable to assume that the IC
STPs are any more subject to IP network attack than the LEC STPs.  It can be assumed that they are
not attached (full air gap) to any publicly accessible IP network and that the only way that their
behaviour can be affected is via SS7 signalling links.

Each IC STP is capable of providing Enhanced and Border Gateway Screening (EGWS/BGWS) applied on any
or all attached SS7 links.  In real networks, any STP associated pair to which an external
administration interconnects is so equipped and full screening is activated.

@item IC service switching points (SSPs).

For the purpose of security testing, only one logical IC SSP need be provided.

The particular IC SSPs of concern to the current investigations are SSPs that are decomposed into
IETF SIGTRAN and ETSI TIPHON components as described under @ref{SIGTRAN Network Configuration} and

The media gateway controller (MGC) is responsible for terminating call control signalling within
both the SCN (Switched Circuit Network) and the IP Network and providing interworking between the

As listed in @tabref{T-1}, logical nodes A, B and C are LEC SSPs that are interconnected to each
other as well as to the IC SSP/MGC (node I).  Nodes D and E are LEC STPs that form the LEC SS7
backbone network.  Nodes F and G are optional IC STP/SGs.  Node H is an SSP/SG within the SIGTRAN
network behaving like an SSP.  Last, node I is an MGC/ASP acting as a gateway to the VoIP network.

The proposed logical node network configuration is illustrated in @figref{7}.

Note that in @figref{7}, only the signalling components are fully implemented.  The Inter-Machine

the Media Gateways (MGs) shown are not implemented, the VoIP Control Network between the MGC and the

@node Physical Network Configuration
@section Physical Network Configuration
@cindex Physical Network Configuration

Each physical node within the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network consists of a high-performance commodity
computing platform, specialized TDM interface cards for providing narrow-band and high-speed SS7
signalling links and narrow-band ISUP call bearer circuits, as well as network interfaces (Ethernet)
to the IP network.

Each physical node within the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network can acts as multiple logical nodes
within the SS7, SIGTRAN or VoIP architectures.  Logical nodes are assigned dedicated circuit
facilities from TDM interfaces as well as forming dedicated TCP or SCTP connections over the IP
network.

Configuration of the network operating environment consists of the mapping of logical nodes onto
physical nodes and the interconnection of the physical nodes.

@subsection Logical Node Mapping Alternatives
@cindex Logical Node Mapping Alternatives

There are several alternatives for mechanisms used for the mapping of logical nodes onto physical
compute platforms, referred to here as virtualization and non-virtualization approaches as follows:

@table @dfn
@item Virtualization

Under a virtualization approach, the machine virtualization provided by the Xen Hypervisor allow one
physical compute platform to run multiple operating system kernels.  Under this approach, each
logical node would run on a different instance of the Linux operating system running under the
hypervisor.

The advantage of this approach for the investigation of stack security is that if the operating
system can be caused to crash, it will only affect one logical node and not all logical nodes
operating on the physical platform.  This has advantages in maintaining independence between
logical nodes.  The disadvantage is configuration complexity.

@item Non-Virtualization

Under a non-virtualization approach, the machine runs a single Linux operating system.  Under this
approach, each logical node would run as a set of processes on one instance of the Linux operating
system running native on the machine.

The advantage of this approach is simplicity.  The disadvantage of this approach for the
investigation of stack security is that, if the operating system can be caused to crash, all logical
nodes will be affected.

@end table

Because the OpenSS7 stacks have been designed to provide partitioned logical nodes in a
non-virtualization environment, the non-virtualization approach will be take at least initially.  If
the need arises, the virtualization approach can be assumed at a later date.

@subsection Logical Nodes versus Physical Nodes
@cindex Logical Nodes versus Physical Nodes

Although the entire SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network could be implemented on so little as a single
compute platform, the objectives of experimentation with signalling system security is better met by
multiple physical compute platforms for the following reasons:

@table @dfn
@item Signalling Capacity

It is not possible for the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Securty Network to approach the signalling capacity of
even small PSTN LEC networks with a single compute platform.  Without large signalling capacity it
is difficult to extrapolate from experimental results to the impact on large scale call handling.
With a high-performance system providing the signalling capacity of a large LEC network,
experimental results are directly applicable to real-world networks.

@item Node Independence

Although logical nodes can be defined so that more than one logical node exists on a given physical
compute platform, doing so creates a dependence between the logical nodes that exists, even if the
virtualization approach is taken.@footnote{Virtualization does not completely partition the platform
into multiple virtual platforms: for example, hardware that can be reset directly, such as Ethernet
cards, will become unusable for all virtual machines and thus all logical nodes.}  It could be
argued that experimental results impacting a network run on a single physical compute platform would
have less of an impact on networks composed of independent platforms.

@item Node Isolation

By placing logical nodes that are normally isolated from a public IP network by an air gap with logical
nodes not so isolated from a public IP network, it might be tempting to show experimental results
where one node affects the other directly through programmatic interfaces on the same machine rather
than via the external interfaces normally associated with such a logical node on the network.

For example, a LEC STP that is separated from an IP network by an air gap running on the same
compute platform as, say, an MGC that is, perhaps, indirectly connected to a public IP network,
would permit an experiment to use programmatic interfaces to the STP on the same platform as the
MGC.  It could be argued that the results of such an experiment are not applicable to real-world
networks.

@item Security

Physical platforms that have a narrow defined purpose are easier to secure than those that have a
broad purpose.  If multiple logical nodes are implemented on the same physical compute platform, it
could be argued that the experiment results would not be applicable to a real-world
telecommunications platform that exists with a very narrow defined scope (such as an STP).

@end table

Nevertheless, small systems can be built using a single compute platform for purposes such
as the indendent development of experiments.

@node Traffic Generation
@chapter Traffic Generation
@cindex Traffic Generation

To meet the purposes of providing an SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network that parallels that found in
actual deployments within the PSTN, generation of network signalling traffic at levels comparable to
a LEC network is required.  To accomplish this, logical nodes terminating ISUP traffic will be
equipped with virtual traffic load generators (i.e. load boxes) in the same physical node.

Traffic loading points are illustrated in @figref{8}.

@figure{lab007,8,Traffic Generation Points}

There are four traffic load generation points within the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network: three
(3) load generation points, one each at each of the LEC SSPs (nodes A, B, C) in the network
configuration as illustrated in @figref{8}; and one (1) load generation point at the IC MGC (node
I).

The characteristics of the traffic load generators are as follows:

@itemize
@item
Each traffic load generator will generate ISUP call traffic for a specific number of subscriber
lines.  Suggested distribution of subscriber lines are 25% of the overall number of subscriber lines
for each of the SSP and MGC traffic generation points.  A target figure is to generate signalling
traffic for one million (1,000,000) overall subscriber lines.
@item
Each subscriber line will be modelled as a pure birth-death process providing between 4-8 CCS (Centi
Call Seconds) of average day peak hour load.  An average holding time of 3-5 minutes will be
used.@footnote{The lower CCS and holding times within the range are typical of residential (non-dial
access) lines; the higher values in the range, indicative of business lines.}
@item
Of this load, 80% will be considered intra-switch and will not be generated.  20% will be considered
inter-switch and will be generated.  Splitting of intra-switch and inter-switch traffic will be done
using determinate load splitting of poisson distributed traffic.
@item
Distibution of calls over the available subscriber lines will be performed considering a fixed and
equal probability of a call being generated between any given subscriber line and any other
subscriber line.
@item
Busy treatment patterns will be simulated.  Subscriber line busy treatment will be based on actual
subscriber line status.  60% of the subscriber lines will be considered as equipped with a
busy/no-answer treatment that results in call connection (i.e. voice mail, CFBNA).  Calls that would
otherwise encounter busy treatment (according to actual line status) will be considered to be
abadonned without reattempt if the terminating line is not equipped with a CFB service.  When
equipped with a CFB service the call will be considered to hold for only 30-60 seconds.
@item
No-answer treatment patterns will be simulated.  Subscriber line no-answer treatment will be
considered on a fixed and equal probability.  Lines considered as having no-answer but equipped with
a no-answer service (60% of the lines) will be considered to hold for only 30-60 seconds.
@item
All trunks busy treatment patterns will be actual.  Inter-office trunk groups will be engineered for
the experienced traffic rates at an Erlang C blocking probability of 0.999 for high-day busy hour.
This is consistent with toll grade trunks traffic engineering.  As the traffic is simulated for
average-day busy hour, trunk blocking probability is almost zero.  Therfore, for the purpose of
simplifying the simulation, all trunks busy treatment will be be applied.

and termination classes of service, class of service screening, trunk group screening, and call
treatment.  In addition to operational measurements, billing records are generated that contain call
detail records on a per-call basis for billable calls.  For the purpose of traffic engineering or
other traffic studies, it is possible to institute special studies that collect information
according to a study criteria.  It is also possible to collect call detail records and call traces
on a specified criteria.  Alarms can be generated on statistics high and low water marks as well as
a result of any number of events determined through translations on the switching element.  Alarms
notify local maintenance personnel with both audible and visual alarms on a LADS (local alarm
display system) and are logged locally and remotely.  Alarms also notify remote NOC (Network
Operations Control) and security systems and personnel.

The SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network logical nodes that provide the ISUP call control will also
provide the ability to perform special studies related to the load traffic for the purposes of
determining the effected of experiments on the system.

@node Compute Hardware
@subsection Compute Hardware
@cindex Compute Hardware

As an efficiency, commodity compute hardware can be used in the SS7/SIGTRAN/VoIP Security Network.

Carrier-grade compute platforms provide redundant processors in hot-swap serviceable, fault-tolerant
architectures with the highest level of availability achievable in the industry.  However,
carrier-grade compute platforms normally correct for transmission facility outages that are the
effect of physical or atmospheric changes.  Whether a system protects against these items are of no
moment in the investigation of signalling system security, and, thus, commodity compute platforms
can be used, lowering the overall system cost significantly.

Carrier-grade compute platforms are normally equipped to operate on 48 VDC power instead of
commercial 110 VAC or 220 VAC power.  With the sole exception of the Central Office environment,
providing a 48 VDC power source can be far more expensive than normal 110 VAC power.  Thus, the use
of commodity compute platforms further lowers the overall system cost.

Because of the need for specialized interface cards to provide interface to the SS7 signalling
network using narrow-band and high-speed SS7 links, the compute hardware cannot be reduced to a
commodity blade processor.  1U or 2U rack-mount systems are required to house the necessary
interface cards and provide sufficient access for the associated cabling.

A disadvantage of using commodity compute platforms powered by 110 VAC and using high-performance
Intel or AMD processors is rack space, noise, cooling, power consumption and preventative
maintenance.  Large scale platforms built with commodity 1U or 2U servers require a far greater
amount of rack space, a heavier cooling load; because they are forced air cooled, a generate a far
greater amount of noise (than the carrier-grade convection cooled systems), consume much more power
(primarily due to processors and the necessary cooling fans), and require a higher degree of
preventative maintenance (forced air cooling requires filter packs to be changed, and otherwise
resutls in packing the equipment over time with dust).
