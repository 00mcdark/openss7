@chapter @value{INTERFACE}

A document describing using XTI for SCCP has been generated to support the use of the OpenSS7 SCCPI
(SCCP Interface) using the methods of the X/Open Transport Interface described in XNS 5.2.  This
document describes a corrigendum to the X/Open TPI Revision 2.0.0 that describes this SCCP transport
provider that supports SCCP to XTI using the X/Open Transport Provider Interface.  No new primitive
or semantics have been added to the interface, merely a definition of the protocol-specific and
provider-specific aspects of SCCP Transport.

SCCP Transport is very close to the XTI XX25 transport specification.  The major difference is that
SCCP Network Layer Addresses and optoins are used instead of ISO Network Service Access Point
addresses and options.  Aside from that, SCCP Transport resembles X.213 (NS) ISO/OSI Network.

@section Addressing

@value{INTERFACE} uses SCCP formatted addresses instead of ISO Network Service Access Point addresses.

@subsection Address Format

The address format for an SCCP address is as follows:

@section Options

Options are formatted according to the @type{t_opthdr} structure decribed in the XTI.  An SCCP
transport provider compliant to this specification supports none, all, or any subset of the options
defined here.  An implementation may restrict the use of any of these options by offering them only
in a privileged or read-only mode.

TPI-SCCP provides options at the @pval{XTI_GENERIC}, @pval{T_SS7_MTP} and @pval{T_SS7_SCCP} option
levels as described in the subsections that follow.  Of the @pval{T_SS7_MTP} options, none of the
options are of end-to-end significance.  Of the @pval{T_SS7_SCCP} options, only @pval{T_SCCP_PCLASS}
and @pval{T_SCCP_CREDIT} are of end-to-end significance.

@node XTI Level Options
@subsection XTI Level Options

Options at this level are specific to the X/Open Transport Interface (XTI/TLI) and are common to all
transport providers.  For more information, see the XTI specification (@ref{XTI,,XTI}).

The options defined with the option level @pval{XTI_GENERIC} are as follows:

@subsubsection XTI_DEBUG

Sets debugging flags for the Stream.  This option is formatted as an array of @type{t_uscalar_t}.
Legal values are implementation defined.  For more information see @manref{xti(3)}.

@subsubsection XTI_LINGER

Sets whether, and the amount of time if, the Stream will linger waiting for unsent data to be
delivered.  This option is formatted as a @type{t_linger} structure defined as follows:

@format
@verbatim
struct t_linger {
        t_scalar_t l_onoff;             /* option on/off */
        t_scalar_t l_linger;            /* linger time */
};
@end verbatim
@end format

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .8
@item @member{l_onoff} @tab
Specifies whether to linger (@pval{T_YES}) or not (@pval{T_NO}).  Legal values are @pval{T_YES} and
@pval{T_NO}.
@item @member{l_linger} @tab
Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to linger.  Legal values are @pval{T_INFINITE},
@pval{T_UNSPEC} and all positive numbers including zero.
@end multitable

For more information, see @manref{xti(3)}.

@subsubsection XTI_RCVBUF

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the receive buffer.  This option is formatted as a
@type{t_uscalar_t}.  Legal value are all positive, non-zero numbers.  For more information, see
@manref{xti(3)}.

@subsubsection XTI_RCVLOWAT

Specifies the low water mark above which received data will be indicated and delivered to the user.
This option is formatted as @type{t_uscalar_t}.  Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.
For more information see @manref{xti(3)}.

@subsubsection XTI_SNDBUF

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the transmit buffer.  This option is formatted as a
@type{t_uscalar_t}.  Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.  For more information see
@manref{xti(3)}.

@subsubsection XTI_SNDLOWAT

Specifies the low water mark above which queued data will be transmitted to the peer.  This option
is formatted as a @type{t_uscalar_t}.  Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.  For more
inforamtion see @manref{xti(3)}.

@node MTP Level Options
@subsection MTP Level Options

@subsubsection T_MTP_SLS

This option sets or gets the @dfn{Signalling Link Selection (SLS)} value assocaited wit a message or
Stream.  The option argument is one @type{t_uscalar_t} value that represents the value of the SLS.
When used in the @prim{T_OPTDATA} or @prim{T_UNITDATA} primitives, this option sets or gets the SLS
value associated with a message.  When used in the @prim{T_INFO} primitives, this option sets or
gets the SLS value associated with a Stream.

This option is of end-to-end significance.  When the @pval{T_MTP_SLS} value is set on outgoing data,
with the @prim{T_OPTDATA_REQ} or @prim{T_UNITDATA_REQ}, the same @pval{T_MTP_SLS} value will be
indicated in the @prim{T_OPTDATA_IND} or @prim{T_UNITDATA_IND} at the transport layer.

@subsubsection T_MTP_MP

This option sets or gets the @dfn{Message Priority (MP)} value associated with a message or Stream.
The option argument is one @type{t_uscalar_t} value that represents the value of the MP.
@prim{T_OPTDATA} or @prim{T_UNITDATA} primitives, this option sets or gets the MP value associated
with a message.  When used in the @prim{T_INFO} primitives, this option sets or gets the MP value
associated with a Stream.

@unnumberedsubsubsec SCCP Quality of Service Options

The TCAP interface uses protocol level T_SS7_SCCP for options at the SCCP level.  SCCP QOS
parameters are communicated to the underlying transport using the option name T_SCCP_QOS.  There are
three QOS structures that can be used in this fashion are listed in @emph{Table 7} as follows:

@c @center @image{tpi_tabx}
@c @center Table 7@strong{@emph{.  SCCP QOS Option Values}}

Quality of service structure @code{N_qos_sel_sccp_t} has the following fields:

@table @emph
@item n_qos_type
This is the NPI Quality of Service structure type and is always set to
@code{N_QOS_SEL_SCCP}, @code{N_QOS_OPT_SEL_SCCP}, or @code{N_QOS_RANGE_SCCP}.
@item protocol_class
This is the protocol class.  The @emph{protocol_class} field can be one of the following:
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_0} (SCCP connectionless protocol class 0),
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_1} (for SCCP connectionless protocol class 1),
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_2} (for SCCP connection-oriented protocol class 2),
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_3} (for SCCP connection-oriented protocol class 3) or
@code{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_2} and @code{N_QOS_PCLASS_3} are not applicable to TCAP.
@item option_flags
If the @emph{options_flags} field has bit @code{N_QOS_OPT_RETERR} set then the SCCP will return the
PDU on error.
@item importance
This is the importance of the message for consideration for SCCP flow control.  This value is not
normally set by the user.  It can be any integer number from 0 to 7, or QOS_UNKNOWN.
@item sequence_selection
This affects the SLS (Signalling Link Selection) value that will be used for protocol classes
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_0} and @code{N_QOS_PCLASS_1}.  This value is not normally set by the user and can
be an integer value or @code{QOS_UNKNOWN}.
@item message_priority
This affects the MP (Message Priority) value that will be used for specific messages in all protocol
classes.  This value is not normally set by the use and can be any integer value from 0 to 3 or the
value @code{QOS_UNKNOWN}.
@end table

@section T_INFO_ACK Values

The following discusses the values that may be returned in the T_INFO_ACK
primitive in response to a T_INFO_REQ primitive.

@table @emph
@item TSDU_size
SCCP has effectively no limit to the amount of data that can be sent in a particular transfer of
user data.  SCCP includes a @dfn{more} bit concept.
@item ETSDU_size
SCCP has supports an expedited data service.
@item CDATA_size
SCCP can send connectin data (user data) with the initi CR (connect request) or firsst CC (connect
confirm) packet
These messages correspond to @dfn{N-CONNECT request} and @dfn{N-CONNECT confirmation} and these
correspond to @prim{T_CONN_REQ} and @prim{T_CONN_RES}.  Because the underlying SCCP connectionless
network may support unlimited size NSDUs, this value may be set to T_INFINITE (-1) or may be set to
the maximum amount of connection data
that can be sent or received in either packet.  This informs the user as to what size to make
data buffers associated with connection indications and confirmations (@prim{T_CONN_IND},
@prim{T_CONN_CON}) and how much data can be sent with connection requests and responses
(@prim{T_CONN_REQ}, @prim{T_CONN_RES}).
@item DDATA_size
SCCP can send disconnect data (user data) with the final (disconnect) packet.  These messages
correspond to the N-DISCONNECT primitive and the @prim{T_DISCON_REQ} and @prim{T_DISCON_IND}. Again,
because the underlying SCCP connectionless network may support unlimited size NSDUs, this value may
be set to T_INFINITE (-1) or may be set to the maximum amount of disconnection data that can be sent
or received in the disconnect packet.  This informs the user as to what size to make data
buffers associated with disconnection indications (@prim{T_DISCON_IND}) and how much data can be
sent with disconnection requests (@prim{T_DISCON_REQ}).
@item ADDR_size
This is the maximum SCCP address size that can be communicated across the interface.  This address
size is the maximum size of the defined SCCP address structure (@code{sizeof sccp_addr_t}) that also
will include address digits up to a maximum of @code{SCCP_MAX_ADDR_LENGTH} octets of digits.  This
informs the user as to what size it should reserve for control buffers so as to receive control
information without buffer truncation.
@item OPT_size
This is the maximum size of the options field used in any TPI message and is the sum of the maximum
option sizes of one of each of the options that can occur together.  This informs the user as to
what size the user should reserve for control buffers to ensure that received control messages that
include options can be contained within the buffer without truncation.
@item TIDU_size
Although an SCCP provider can support unlimited TSDU size, it cannot normally support unlimited
TIDU size.  This is because the underlying SCCP NSDU may be limited in size.  The SCCP provider is
not responsible for segmenting user data sequences offered to the provider from the user in as
@msg{M_DATA}.  This is the maximum size of the TIDU that corresponds to the maximum size of the
underlying NSDU.  Because the underlying SCCP provider may have no limit on the NSDU size (i.e., it
supports segmentation of connectionless NSDUs) this may be more in the manner of an optimal
recommendation to the user rather than an absolute maximum.  Because of this, a given SCCP provider
might not reject TIDUs that are larger than this value.
@item SERV_type
There are two service types supported by an SCCP provider: T_COTS and T_CLTS.  T_CLTS (SCCP Protocol
classes 0 and 1) is a connectionless transport servicew with or without error notification.  T_COTS
(SCCP Protocol classes 2 or 3) is a connection-oriented transport service with or without error
notification.  The value reflected here is dependent on the setting of option
T_SCCP_PCLASS.
@item CURRENT_state
Provides the current state of the Transport Provider.  SCCP providers use the same states as other
TPI providers.
@item PROVIDER_flag
TPI provider flags that are set are SENDZERO (because SCCP supports the sending of packets without
user data) and XPG4_1 (to indicate that the transport provider supports the latest TPI semantics).

@node @value{INTERFACE} Header Files
@appendix @value{INTERFACE} Header Files

@node @value{INTERFACE} Library
@appendix @value{INTERFACE} Library

Because this Corrigendum provides an SCCP interface that conforms to the Transport Provider Interface
(TPI) Revision 2.0.0, it can use the libraries provided for use by the TPI.  In particular, the
@manref{libxti(3)} library can be used.

@node @value{INTERFACE} Drivers and Modules
@appendix @value{INTERFACE} Drivers and Modules

@menu
* SCCP Driver and Module::
* NPI Conversion Module::
* TPI Conversion Module::
@end menu

The Signalling Connection Control Part Interface (SCCPI) is used to provide services to a number of
@cite{STREAMS} drivers and modules in addition to user-space applications.
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} provides a range of @cite{STREAMS} multiplexing drivers, pseudo-device
drivers, and pushable modules that complement the SS7 Signalling Connection Control Part
driver that provides the Signalling Connection Control Part Interface (SCCPI) at it s upper layer.

@node NPI Conversion Module
@section NPI Conversion Module

The @dfn{NPI Conversion Module} is a specific-purpose pushable @dfn{STREAMS} module that can be
pushed over any Stream conforming to the Signalling Connection Control Part Interface (SCCPI) and
converts that Stream to an NPI-SCCP service interface conforming to the NPI-SCCP specification.
This permits the SCCP Stream to be used by external applications using the NPI API library
(@manref{libnpiapi(3)}).

A minor device number on the SCCP driver is defined that will @manref{autopush(8)} the @dfn{NPI
Conversion Module} that is part of this package.

Similarly, a minor device number on the SUA driver is also defined.

@node TPI Conversion Module
@section TPI Conversion Module

The @dfn{TPI Conversion Module} is a general-purpose pushable @dfn{STREAMS} module that can be
pushed over any Stream conforming to the Network Provider Interface (NPI) and converts that
Stream to an XTI-SCCP service interface conforming to the XTI-SCCP specification.  This permits the
SCCP Stream to be used by external applications using the XTI/TLI Library (@manref{libxnet(3)}).

A minor device number on the SCCP driver is defined that will @manref{autopush(8)} the @dfn{NPI
Conversion Module} and then push the general-purpose @dfn{TPI Conversion Module} that is part of the
@file{strxnet} package.  The @dfn{NPI Conversion Module} provides option conversion assistance to
this module.

Similarly, a minor device number on the TUA driver is so defined.

@node @value{INTERFACE} Utilities
@appendix @value{INTERFACE} Utilities

In general, any of the utilities provided by the underlying SCCP or SUA provider that support
input-output controls defined in the SCCPI specification can be used on SCCP or SUA Streams upon
which the @dfn{TPI Conversion Module} has been pushed to conform to this Addendum.  The @dfn{TPI
Conversion Module} passes input-output controls transparently to the underlying SCCP module.

Therefore, this specification does not define any utilities of its own.
