@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This document specifies a @cite{STREAMS}-based kernel-level instantiation of the ITU-T
@value{MANUAL_TITLE} definition.  The @value{MANUAL_TITLE} enables the user of a @value{PART}
service to access and use any of a variety of conforming @value{PART} providers without specific
knowledge of the provider's protocol.  The service interface is designed to support any network
@value{PART} protocol and user @value{PART} protocol.  This interface only specifies access to
@value{PART} service providers, and does not address issues concerning @value{PART} management,
protocol performance, and performance analysis tools.

This specification assumes that the reader is familiar with ITU-T state machines and @value{PART}
interfaces (e.g.  Q.704, T1.111.4), and @cite{STREAMS}.

@node The @value{SHORT} Layer
@chapter The @value{SHORT} Layer

@menu
* Model of the @value{INTERFACE}::
* @value{INTERFACE} Services::
* @value{SHORT} Service Primitives::
@end menu

The @value{SHORT} Layer provides the means to manage the association of @value{SHORT}-Users into
connections.  It is responsible for the routing and management of data to and from SS7 network
connections between @value{SHORT}-user entities.

@node Model of the @value{INTERFACE}
@section Model of the @value{INTERFACE}

The @value{INTERFACE} defines the services provided by the signalling link layer to the signalling
link user at the boundary between the signalling link provider and the signalling link user entity.
The interface consists of a set of primitives defined as @cite{STREAMS} messages that provide access
to the signalling link layer services, and are transferred between the @value{SHORT} user entity and
the @value{SHORT} provider.  These primitives are of two types; ones that originate from the
@value{SHORT} user, and other that originate from the @value{SHORT} provider.  The primitives that
originate from the @value{SHORT} user make requests to the @value{SHORT} provider, or respond to an
indication of an event of the @value{SHORT} provider.  The primitives that originate from the
@value{SHORT} provider are either confirmations of a request or are indications to the CCS user that
an event has occurred.  @figref{1} shows the model of the @value{INTERFACE}.

@figuresized{mtpi01,1,Model of the @value{INTERFACE},4.0in}

The @value{INTERFACE} allows the @value{SHORT} provider to be configured with any @value{SHORT} user
(such as ISUP) that also conforms to the @value{INTERFACE}.  A call control layer user can also be a
user program that conforms to the @value{INTERFACE} and accesses the @value{SHORT} provider via
@manref{putmsg(2s)} and @manref{getmsg(2s)} system calls.

@node @value{INTERFACE} Services
@section @value{INTERFACE} Services

The features of the @value{INTERFACE} are defined in terms of the services provided by the
@value{SHORT}, and the individual primitives that may flow between the @value{SHORT}-User and the
@value{SHORT}.

The services supported by the @value{INTERFACE} are based on two distinct modes of communication,
connectionless (CLMS) and connection oriented (COMS).  Within these modes, the @value{INTERFACE}
provides support for both sequenced and unsequenced message transfer.  Also, the @value{INTERFACE}
supports services for local mangement.

@subsection CLMS

The main features of the connectionless mode of communication are:

@enumerate
@item
it is datagram oriented;
@item
it provides transfer of data in self contained units;
@item
there is no logical relationship between these units of data.
@end enumerate

Connectionless mode communication has no separate phases.  Each unit of data is transmitted from
source to destination independently, appropriate addressing information is included with each unit
of data.  Although the units of data are transmitted independently from source to destination,
@value{SHORT} provides a high level of assurance of sequencing if sequenced service is requested.
When unsequenced service is requested, there are no guarantees of proper sequence.  Although
@value{SHORT} services are inherently unreliable, @value{SHORT} provide a high level of assurance
that messages are not lost.

The connectionless service of @value{SHORT} is suited to @value{SHORT} User protocols such as the
Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP).@footnote{@ref{Q.711,,Q.711}.}

@subsection COMS

The main features of the @value{SHORT} connection oriented mode of communication are:

@enumerate
@item
it is virtual circuit oriented;
@item
it provides transfer of data via a pre-established path.
@end enumerate

There are three phases to each instance of communication: Connection Establishment, Data Transfer;
and Connection Termination.  Units of data arrive at their destination in the same order as they
departed their source when the sequenced delivery service is requested and the data is protected
against duplication or loss of data within some specified quality of service.

The connection oriented service of @value{SHORT} is suited to @value{SHORT} User protocols such as
the Integrated Services Digital Network User Part (ISUP), [Q.764] Telephone User Part (TUP), [Q.724]
and Bearer Indexed Call Control (BICC).@footnote{ISUP consists of @dfn{signalling relations} between
two switches which also have digital facilities between them.  In general an ISUP @value{SHORT}-User
can communicate with many other @value{SHORT}-User peers, however, signalling between any given two
enpoints only concerns the digital facilities which exist between the two endpoints.  So, management
of ISUP switches is best performed on a pairing of endpoints (@dfn{signalling relations}).  Also,
the COMS mode of operation is provided in support of DPC list Routing Keys for M3UA. [RFC 4666]}

@subsection Local Management

The @value{INTERFACE} specifications also defines a set of local management functions that apply to
COMS and CLMS modes of communication.  These services have local significance only.

@subsection Provider Management

The @value{INTERFACE} specification also defines a set of provider management functions that apply
to the @value{SHORT} service provider.  These services have local and end-to-end significance.

@node Local Management Services
@section Local Management Services

The services defined in this section are outside the scope of international standards.  These
services apply to COMS and CLMS modes of communication.  They are invoked for the
initialization/de-initialization of a stream connected to the @value{SHORT}.  They are also used to
manage options supported by the @value{SHORT} and to report information on the supported parameter
values.

@subsection @value{LONG} Information Reporting Service

This service provides information on the options supported by the @value{SHORT} provider.

@table @strong
@item MTP_INFO_REQ:
@prindex MTP_INFO_REQ
This primitive requests that the @value{SHORT} return the values of all the supported protocol
parameters.  This request may be invoked during any phase.
@item MTP_INFO_ACK:
@prindex MTP_INFO_ACK
This primitive is in response to the @prim{MTP_INFO_REQ} primitive and returns the values of the
supported protocol parameters to the @value{SHORT}-User.
@end table


The sequence of primitives for @value{SHORT} information management is shown in @figref{2}.

@figuresized{mtpi02,2,@value{LONG} Information Reporting Service,4.0in}

@subsection @value{SHORT} Address Service

This service allows an @value{SHORT}-User to determine the @value{SHORT} address (@value{SHORT}-SAPI
or signalling point code and service indicator) that has been associated with a Stream.  It permits
the @value{SHORT}-User to not necessarily retain this information locally, and allows the
@value{SHORT}-User to determine this information from the @value{SHORT} provider at any time.

@table @strong
@item MTP_ADDR_REQ:
@prindex MTP_ADDR_REQ
This primitive requests that the @value{SHORT} return information concerning which @value{SHORT}
address (@value{SHORT}-SAPI) the @value{SHORT}-User is bound as well as the @value{SHORT} address
upon which the @value{SHORT}-User is currently engaged in association.
@item MTP_ADDR_ACK:
@prindex MTP_ADDR_ACK
This primitive is in response to the @prim{MTP_ADDR_REQ} primitive and indicates to the
@value{SHORT}-User the requested information.
@end table

The sequence of primitives is shown in @figref{3}.

@figuresized{mtpi42,3,@value{LONG} User Address Service,4.0in}

@subsection @value{SHORT} User Bind Service


This service allows an @value{SHORT} address (@value{SHORT}-SAPI: signalling point code and service
indicator) to be associated with a Stream.

It allows the @value{SHORT}-User to negotiate the number of connect indications that can remain
unacknowledged for that @value{SHORT}-User (a connect indication is considered unacknowledged while
it is awaiting a corresponding connect response or release request from the @value{SHORT}-User).
This service also defines a mechanism that allows a Stream (bound to an @value{SHORT} address of the
@value{SHORT}-User) to be reserved to handle incoming connections only.  This Stream is referred to
as the listener Stream.

@table @strong
@item MTP_BIND_REQ:
@prindex MTP_BIND_REQ
This primitive requests that the @value{SHORT}-User be bound to a particular @value{SHORT} address
(@value{SHORT}-SAPI), and negotiate the number of allowable outstanding connect indications for that
address.
@item MTP_BIND_ACK:
@prindex MTP_BIND_ACK
This primitive is in response to the @prim{MTP_BIND_REQ} primitive and indicates to the user that
the specified @value{SHORT}-User has been bound to an @value{SHORT} address.
@end table

The sequence of primitives is shown in @figref{4}.

@node Connectionless Services
@section Connectionless Services

The CLMS allows for the transfer of @value{SHORT}-User data in one or both directions simultaneously
without establishing an association between @value{SHORT}-User peers.  A set of primitives are
defined that carry user data and control information between the @value{SHORT}-User and
@value{SHORT} entities.  The primitives are modeled as requests initiated by the @value{SHORT}-User
and indications initiated by the @value{SHORT} provider.  Indications may be initiated by the
@value{SHORT} independently from requests by the @value{SHORT}-User.

The connectionless @value{SHORT} service consists of one phase.

@subsection Data Transfer

@node Connection Oriented Services
@section Connection Oriented Services

This section describes the required @value{SHORT} service primitives that define the CLMS interface.

The queue model for CLMS is discused in more detail in ITU-T Q.704. [Q.704] For Q.704 specific
conformance considerations, see Addendum 1.

The queue model represents the operation of an @value{SHORT} connection in the abstract by a pair of
queues linking the two @value{SHORT} addresses.  There is one queue for each direction of signalling
transfer.  The ability of a user to add objects to a queue will be determined by the behavior of the
user removing objects from that queue, and the state of the queue.  The pair of queues is considered
to be available for each potential association.  Objects that are entered or removed from the queue
are either as a result of interactions at the two @value{SHORT} addresses, or as the result of
@value{SHORT} initiatives.

@itemize @minus{}
@item
A queue is empty until a connect object has been entered and can be returned to this state, with
loss of its contents, by the @value{SHORT}.
@item
Objects may be entered into a queue as a result of the action of the source @value{SHORT}-User,
subject to control by the @value{SHORT}.
@item
Objects may also be entered into a queue by the @value{SHORT}.
@item
Objects are removed from the queue under the control of the receiving @value{SHORT} user.
@item
Objects are normally removed under the control of the @value{SHORT}-User in the same order as they
were entered except:
@item
if the object is of a type defined to be able to advance ahead of the preceding object (however, no
object is defined to be able to advance ahead of another object of the same type), or
@item
if the following object is defined to be destructive with respect to the preceding object on the
queue.  If necessary, the last object on the queue will be deleted to allow a destructive object to
be entered --- they will therefore always be added to the queue.  For example, "reset" objects are
defined to be destructive with respect to all other objects.
@end itemize

@tabref{5} shows the ordering relationship amoung the queue model objects.

@tabfig{mtpi_tab05,5,Flow Control Relationships Between Queue Model Objects}

@multitable @columnfractions 0.10 0.90
@item AA @tab Indicates that Object X is defined to be able to advance ahead of preceding Object Y.
@item DES @tab Indicates that Object X is defined to be destructive with respect to preceding Object Y.
@item @minus{} @tab Indicates that Object X is neither destructive with respect to Object Y, nor able to advance ahead of Object Y.
@item N/A @tab Indicates that Object X will not occur in a position succeeding Object Y in a valid state of a queue.
@end multitable

@subsection Connection Establishment Phase

A pair of queues is associated with an @value{SHORT} association between two @value{SHORT} addresses
when the @value{SHORT} receives an @prim{MTP_CONN_REQ} primitive at one of the @value{SHORT}
addresses resulting in a connect object being entered into the queue.  The queues will remain
associated with the @value{SHORT} association until an @prim{MTP_DISCON_REQ} primitive (resulting in
a disconnect object) is either entered or removed from a queue.  Similarly, in the queue from the
remote @value{SHORT}-User, objects can be entered into the queue only after the connect object
associated with an @prim{MTP_CONN_REQ} has been entered into the queue.

The @value{SHORT} association procedure will fail if the @value{SHORT} is unable to route to the
remote @value{SHORT}-User.

@subsubsection User primitives for Successful @value{SHORT} Association Establishment

@table @strong
@item MTP_CONN_REQ:
@prindex MTP_CONN_REQ
This primitive requests that the @value{SHORT} establish an association between the local
@value{SHORT}-User and the specified destination.
@end table

@subsubsection Provider primitives for Successful @value{SHORT} Association Establishment

@table @strong
@item MTP_CONN_CON:
@prindex MTP_CONN_CON
This primitive indicates to the @value{SHORT}-User that an association request has been confirmed.
@end table


The sequence of primitives in a successful @value{SHORT} association establishment is defined by the
time sequence diagram as shown in @figref{11}.

@figuresized{mtpi24,11,@value{LONG} Association Service,4.0in}

@subsection Data Transfer Phase

Flow control on the @value{SHORT} association is done by management of queue capacity, by allowing
objects of certain type to be inserted to the queues as shown in @tabref{5}.

@subsubsection User primitives for @value{SHORT} Data Transfer

@subsection Connection Termination Phase

The @value{SHORT} association release procedure is initialized by the insertion of a disconnect
object (associated with an @prim{MTP_DISCON_REQ}) into the queue.  As shown in @figref{13}, the
disconnect procedure is destructive with respect to other objects in the queue, and eventually
results in the emptying of queues and termination of the @value{SHORT} association.

@subsubsection User Primitives for @value{SHORT} Association Termination

@end vtable

@subsubheading Flags

@subsubheading Rules

The following rules apply to the establishment of associations between the specified addresses:

@itemize ---
@item
If the @var{mtp_addr_length} field in the MTP_CONN_REQ primitive is zero, then the @value{SHORT} is
to select a remote @value{SHORT} address (@value{SHORT}-SAPI) with which to associate.  If the
@value{SHORT} cannot select a address for the association, the @value{SHORT} responds with an
MTP_ERROR_ACK primitive with error MNOADDR.
@item
If the @var{mtp_addr_length} field in the MTP_CONN_REQ primitive is non-zero, the @value{SHORT} is
to associate with the specified remote @value{SHORT} address (@value{SHORT}-SAPI).  if the
@value{SHORT} cannot associate with the specified remote @value{SHORT} address (@value{SHORT}-SAPI),
the primitive will fail and the @value{SHORT} will return an MTP_ERROR_ACK primitive with the

The following rules apply to the @value{SHORT} addresses (@value{SHORT}-SAPIs):

@itemize ---
@item
If the @value{SHORT}-User does not specify an @value{SHORT} address (i.e. @var{mtp_addr_length} is
set to zero), then the @value{SHORT} may attempt to assign a remote @value{SHORT} address
(@value{SHORT}-SAPI) and associate it with the stream for the duration of the association.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Valid States

This primitive is valid in state MTPS_IDLE.

@subsubheading New State

The new state is MTPS_DATA_XFER.

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

The following acknolwedgements are valid for this primitive:

@itemize ---
@item @emph{Successful}: Correct acknowledgement of the primtive is indicated via the MTP_OK_ACK
primitive.
@item @emph{Unsuccessful (Non-fatal errors)}:  These are indicated via the MTP_ERROR_ACK primitive.
The applicable non-fatal errors are defined as follows:
@vtable @var
@item MSYSERR
A system error has occurred and the UNIX system eror is indicated in the primitive.
@item MOUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
@item MBADADDR
The @value{SHORT} address as specified in the primitive was in an incorrect format, or the address
contained illegal information.
@item MNOADDR
The user did not provide an @value{SHORT} address and one was required by the @value{SHORT}.  The
@value{SHORT} could not select a remote @value{SHORT} address
(@value{SHORT}-SAPI).
@item MADDRBUSY
The @value{SHORT} could not use the specified address because the specified address is already in
use.
@item MBADFLAG
The specified flags were invalid.
@item MNOTSUPPORT
The primitive is not supported for by the @value{SHORT} provider.
@item MBADPRIM
The primitive was of an incorrect format (i.e. too small, or an offset it out of range).
@item MACCESS
The user did not have proper permissions for the use of the requested address.

@node Signalling Relation Data Transfer Phase
@subsection Signalling Relation Data Transfer Phase

The data transfer service primitive provide for an exchange of @value{SHORT}-User data, known as
MSDUs, in either direction or in both directions simultaneously on a signalling relation.  The
@value{SHORT} service preserves the sequence of MSDUs that have the same Signalling Link Selection
(SLS) value specified in the MTP_TRANSFER_REQ.  MSDUs are self-contained messages with implicit
boundaries.

The following @value{SHORT} service primtiives pertain to the Data Transfer phase of a signalling
relation.

@subsubsection @value{LONG} Transfer Request
@subsubheading MTP_TRANSFER_REQ
@prindex MTP_TRANSFER_REQ

This user-originated primitive indicates to the @value{SHORT} that this message contains
@value{SHORT}-User data.  It allows the transfer of @value{SHORT}-User data between
@value{SHORT}-Users, without modification by the @value{SHORT} provider.

The @value{SHORT}-User must send an integral number of octets of data greater than zero.  In a case
where the size of the MSDU exceeds the MIDU (as specified by the size of the @pval{MIDU_size}
parameter of the @prim{MTP_INFO_ACK} primitive), the MSDU may be broken up into more than one MIDU.
When an MSDU is broken up into more than one MIDU, the @pval{MTP_MORE_DATA_FLAG} will be set on each
MIDU except the last one.

@subsubheading Format
@tpindex struct MTP_transfer_req
@tpindex MTP_transfer_req_t

The format of the message is one or more @msg{M_DATA} blocks.  Use of a @msg{M_PROTO} message block
is optional.  The @msg{M_PROTO} message block is used for two reasons:

@enumerate
@item
to indicate that the MSDU is broken into more than one MIDU, and that the data carried in the
following @msg{M_DATA} message block constitutes one MIDU;
@item
to indicate the message priority and signalling link selection to be associated with the MSDU.
@end enumerate

@noindent
@emph{Guidelines for the use of @msg{M_PROTO}}

The following guidelines must be followed with respect to the use of the @msg{M_PROTO} message
block:

@enumerate
@item
The @msg{M_PROTO} message block need not be present when the MSDU size is less than or equal to the
MIDU size and one of the following is true:
@itemize @minus{}
@item
the values of the message priority and signalling link selection have been previously set with the
MTP_OPTMGMT_REQ primitive; or
@item
the default values of the message priority and signalling link selection are to be specified.
@end itemize
@item
The @msg{M_PROTO} message block must be present when:
@itemize @minus{}
@item
The MSDU size is greater than the MIDU size.
@item
the values of the message priority or signalling link selection as specified by the MTP_OPTMGMT_REQ
primitive needs to be overriden for this MSDU.
@end itemize
@end enumerate

The format of the @msg{M_PROTO} message block, if present, is as follows:

@smallexample
typedef struct MTP_transfer_req @{
        mtp_ulong mtp_primitive;        /* always MTP_TRANSFER_REQ */
        mtp_ulong mtp_dest_length;      /* length of destination address */
        mtp_ulong mtp_dest_offset;      /* offset of destination address */
        mtp_ulong mtp_mp;               /* message priority */
        mtp_ulong mtp_sls;              /* signalling link selection */
@} MTP_transfer_req_t;
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var
@item mtp_primitive
Specifies the primitive type.  This field is always coded @var{MTP_TRANSFER_REQ}.
@item mtp_dest_length
Specifies the length of the destination @value{SHORT} address (@value{SHORT}-SAPI) to which the
message is to be sent.  If the stream is connected in an established signalling relation, this field
may be coded zero (0).
@item mtp_dest_offset
Specifies the offset of the destination @value{SHORT} address (@value{SHORT}-SAPI) from the
beginning of the @msg{M_PROTO} message block.
@item mtp_mp
Specifies the message priority to be used when sending the message.  Support for message priority is
protocol variant
and provider specific.
@item mtp_sls
Specifies the signalling link selection value to be used when sending the message.  If this field is
coded MTP_UNKNOWN (-1) then the @value{SHORT} provider will choose a value of the signalling link
selection which best performs loadsharing of the resulting message traffic.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Rules

If the signalling relation is associated with a single destination address (@value{SHORT}-SAPI),
@msg{M_DATA} blocks can be used with no @msg{M_PROTO} block to transfer messages.  The destination
adddress and the values of SLS and MP will be the default values or the laster values that were
successfully set with MTP_OPTMGMT_REQ.

@subsubheading Valid States

This primitive is valid in state MTP_IDLE for connectionless streams and in state MTP_DATA_XFER for
pseudo-connection oriented streams.

@subsubheading New State

The new state is unchanged.

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

This primitive does not require any acknowledgements, although it may generate a fatal error.  This
is indicated to the @value{SHORT}-User via a @msg{M_ERROR} STREAMS message type (specifying an errno
value of @errno{EPROTO}) which results in the failure of all system calls on that stream.  The
applicable errors are defined as follows:

@vtable @errno
@item EPROTO
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
@itemize ---
@item
The @value{SHORT} interface was found to be in an incorrect state.
@item
The amount of @value{SHORT}-User data associated wtih the primitive was outside the range supported
by the @value{SHORT} (as specified in the MIDU_size parameter of the MTP_INFO_ACK primitive).
@item
The options requested are either not support by the @value{SHORT}.
@item
The @msg{M_PROTO} message block was not followed by one or more @msg{M_DATA} message blocks.
@item
The amount of @value{SHORT}-User data associated with the current MSDU is outside the range
supported by the @value{SHORT} (as specified by the MSDU_size parameter in the MTP_INFO_ACK
primitive.)
@item
The flags field contained an unknown value.
@end itemize

@strong{Note.} @i{If the interface is in the MTP_IDLE state when the provider received the
MTP_TRANSFER_REQ primitive, then the @value{SHORT} should discard the request without generating a
fatal error.}

@node Diagnostics Requirements
@chapter Diagnostics Requirements

Two error handling facilities should be provided to the @value{SHORT} user: one to handle non-fatal
errors, and the other to handle fatal errors.

@section Non-Fatal Error Handling Facility

These are errors that do not change the state of the @value{SHORT} service interface as seen by the
@value{SHORT} service user, and provide the user the option of reissuing the @value{SHORT} service
primitive with the corrected options specification.  The non-fatal error handling is provided only
to those primitive that require acknowledgements, and uses the @prim{MTP_ERROR_ACK} primitive to
report these errors.  These errors retain the state of hte @value{SHORT} service interface the same
as it was before the @value{SHORT} service provider received the primitive that was in error.
Syntax errros and rule violations are reported via the non-fatal error handling facility.

@section Fatal Error Handling Facility

These errors are issued by the @value{SHORT} provider when it detects errors that are not
correctable by the @value{SHORT} user, or if it is unable to report a correctible error to the
@value{SHORT} user.  Fatal errors are indicated via the STREAMS message type @msg{M_ERROR} with the
UNIX system error @errno{EPROTO}.  The @msg{M_ERROR} STREAMS message type will result in the failure
of all the UNIX system calls on the stream.  The @value{SHORT} user can recover from a fatal error
by having all the processes close the files associated with the stream, and then reopening them for
processing.

These errors are issued by the @value{SHORT} when it detects errors that are not correctable by the

@unnumberedsec Addendum for ITU-T Q.704 Conformance

This addendum describes the formats and rules that are specific to ETSI EN 300 008-1 V3.2.2.  The
addendum must be used along with the generic @value{INTERFACE} as defined in the main document, and
the EN 300 008-1 conformance defined in Addendum 2, when implementing an @value{SHORT} that will be
configured with the EN 300 008-1 @value{LONG}.

@unnumberedsec Primitives and Rules for ETSI EN 300 008-1 V3.2.2 Conformance

The following are the additional rules that apply to the @value{INTERFACE} primitives for ETSI EN
300 008-1 V3.2.2 compatibility.

@section Mapping @value{INTERFACE} Primitives to Q.701

Table A-1 shows the mapping of the @value{INTERFACE} primitives to the @value{SHORT} definition
primitives listed in ITU-T Recommendation Q.704.

The mapping of @value{INTERFACE} primitives to Q.701 primitives is shown in @tabref{6}.  For the
most part, this mapping is a one to one mapping of service primitives, with the exception of
@emph{Connect Request} and @emph{Disconnect Request}.

In Q.701 there is no concept of an @dfn{association} between @value{SHORT}-entities.  In OpenSS7
@value{INTERFACE}, the @prim{MTP_CONN_REQ} and @prim{MTP_DISCON_REQ} primitives are used to
establish and release an association between @value{SHORT}-entities.

@section Mapping @value{INTERFACE} Primitives to ANSI T1.111.1

The mapping of @value{INTERFACE} primitives to T1.111.1 primitives is shown in @tabref{7}.  For the
most part, this mapping is a one to one mapping of service primitives, with the exception of
@emph{Connect Request} and @emph{Disconnect Request}.

In T1.111.1 there is no concept of an @dfn{association} between @value{SHORT}-entities.  In OpenSS7
@value{INTERFACE}, the @prim{MTP_CONN_REQ} and @prim{MTP_DISCON_REQ} primitives are used to
establish and release an association between @value{SHORT}-entities.

@section Mapping @value{INTERFACE} Primitives to ETSI ETS 300 008-2

The mapping of @value{INTERFACE} primitives to ETS 300 008-2 primitives is shown in @tabref{8}.  For the
most part, this mapping is a one to one mapping of service primitives, with the exception of
@emph{Connect Request} and @emph{Disconnect Request}.

In ETS 300 008-2 there is no concept of an @dfn{association} between @value{SHORT}-entities.  In OpenSS7
@value{INTERFACE}, the @prim{MTP_CONN_REQ} and @prim{MTP_DISCON_REQ} primitives are used to

@table @emph
@item Signalling Data Link Service Data Unit
A grouping of SDL user data whose boundaries are preserved from one end of the signalling data link
connection to the other.
@item Data transfer
The phase in connection and connectionless modes that supports the transfer of data between to
signalling data link users.
@item SDL provider
The signalling data link layer protocol that provides the services of the signalling data link
interface.
@item SDL user
The user-level application or user-level or kernel-level protocol that accesses the services of the
signalling data link layer.
@item Local management
The phase in connection and connectionless modes in which a SDL user initializes a stream and
attaches a PPA address to the stream.  Primitives in this phase generate local operations only.
@item PPA
The point at which a system attaches itself to a physical communications medium.
@item PPA identifier
An identifier of a particular physical medium over which communication transpires.
