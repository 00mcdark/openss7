1 Introduction
**************

This document describes the protocol-specific information that is relevant to
for SS7 Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP).  This document also
describes the protocol-specific information that is relevant when SCCP network
services are provided over an IP network.

In general, this document describes the characteristics that the SCCP and M3UA
NSP have in common, with notes indicating where they differ.

This document also defines the data structures and constants required for SCCP
and M3UA NSP which are exposed through the `<sys/npi_mtp.h>' header file.

1.1 Protocol Address
====================

In an SCCP environment, the protocol address is the SCCP-SAPI which identifies
the SS7 network, SS7 Signalling Point Code within the SS7 network, and the
SCCP-User identifier (Subsystem Number).

1.2 Connection and Connectionless Modes
=======================================

1.2.1 Connection-Oriented Mode
------------------------------

The Signalling Connection Control Part NSP supports connection-oriented mode
for SCCP-User protocols that form an association between two SCCP-Users in an
end-to-end exchange.  This includes TUP, ISUP, BTNUP, BICC and other call
control protocols.

The Signalling Connection Control Part does not support a true
connection-oriented mode.  When associations are formed with `N_CONN_REQ', no
protocol messages are exchanged between the local and remote SCCP users and the
`N_CONN_REQ' primitive will always succeed unless the remote SCCP user is not
known to the NSP.  Because of this, it is not possible for the Signalling
Connection Control Part to accept incoming connections; `N_CONN_IND' primitives
will not be issued by the NSP.

1.2.2 Connection-less Mode
--------------------------

The Signalling Connection Control Part NSP supports connection-less mode for
SCCP-User protocols that form one-to-many or many-to-one or many-to-many
associations and are not restricted to an end-to-end exchange at SCCP.  This
includes SCCP, MTUP, and other SCCP Users of a connection-less nature.

1.3 Sending Data of Zero Octets
===============================

The Signalling Connection Control Part, both in connection-oriented mode and in
connection-less mode, does not permit sending a NSDU of zero octets.  So, in
connection-less mode, if the number of M_DATA block bytes is zero, the
`N_UNITDATA_REQ' primitive will always fail with the NPI_error in the
N_ERROR_ACK set to NBADDATA.  In connection-oriented mode, if the number of
M_DATA block bytes is zero, the N_DATA_REQ primitive will always fail with the
NPI_error in the N_ERROR_ACK set to NBADDATA.  if either the N_MORE_DATA_FLAG
is not set in the DATA_xfer_flags, or the N_MORE_DATA_FLAG flag is not set and
the preceding N_DATA_REQ primitive completed a NSDU (that is, the call has
requested sending a zero byte NSDU).

1.4 Quality of Service Parameters
=================================

The quality of service structures are specific to SCCP.  All quality of service
parameters are association-related, that is, they are options with end-to-end
significance.  They may be negotiated in the NPI state NS_IDLE, and are
read-only in all other sates except NS_UNBND.

1.4.1 Quality of Service Structures
-----------------------------------

SCCP-NPI provides quality of service structure selection for data, connection
requests, information, and range information.  The SCCP specific quality of
service structures are discussed in detail below.

2 NPI Primitives
****************

This section describes the formats and rules for the Network Provider Interface
that are specific to the Signalling Connection Control Part.  This section must
be used along with the generic Network Provider Interface Specification when
implementing a NSP that will be configured with the SS7 Signalling Connection
Control Part.

2.1 Protocol Address
====================

The network address is used in the `N_BIND_REQ', `N_BIND_ACK', `N_CONN_REQ',
`N_CONN_CON', `N_UNITDATA_REQ', `N_UNITDATA_IND', and `N_UDERROR_IND'
primitives.

 Format
-------

The SCCP network protocol address uses a sockaddr struct to support sockets
compatibility libraries consistent with the SCCP XTI/TLI interface.

The network protocol address is formatted as follows:

typedef struct sccp_addr {
        uint ni;                        /* network indicator */
        uint ri;                        /* routing indicator */
        uint pc;                        /* point code (-1 not present) */
        uint ssn;                       /* subsystem number (0 not present) */
        uint gtt;                       /* type of global title */
        uint tt;                        /* translation type */
        uint es;                        /* encoding scheme */
        uint nplan;                     /* numbering plan */
        uint nai;                       /* nature of address indicator */
        uint alen;                      /* address length */
        uint8_t addr[0];                /* address digits */
        /* followed by address bytes */
} sccp_addr_t;

#define SCCP_MAX_ADDR_LENGTH 32

#define SCCP_RI_DPC_SSN         0       /* route on DPC/SSN */
#define SCCP_RI_GT              1       /* route on GT */

#define SCCP_GTTTYPE_NONE       0       /* no GT */
#define SCCP_GTTTYPE_NAI        1       /* NAI only */
#define SCCP_GTTTYPE_TT         2       /* TT only */
#define SCCP_GTTTYPE_NP         3       /* TT, ES, NPLAN */

 Rules
------

 Rules for sizes:
.................

  1. SCCP conforming NSP will return a value of `N_INVALID' (`-1UL') for the
     `ETSDU_size' data size, indicating that the NSP does not support expedited
     data transfer.

  2. SCCP conforming NSP will return the same defined value in the `NSDU_size',
     `CDATA_size' and `DDATA_size' fields.  This value is the maximum size of a
     NSU SDU that can be guaranteed transferred by the NSP.  The exact value of
     these fields will depend on the signalling links supported by the SCCP
     provider.

  3. SCCP conforming NSP will return zero (`0'), `N_INVALID' (`-1UL') or the
     same value as `NSDU_size' in the `CDATA_size' and field.  When the SCCP
     provider returns a value of zero (`0') or `N_INVALID' (`-1UL') for
     `CDATA_size', it is indicating that connection data is not permitted with
     the `N_CONN_REQ' primitive.  When the SCCP provider returns the same value
     as `NSDU_size', it is indicating that normal data is permitted with the
     `N_CONN_REQ' primitive.

  4. SCCP conforming NSP will return zero (`0'), `N_INVALID' (`-1UL') or the
     same value as `NSDU_size' in the `DDATA_size' and field.  When the SCCP
     provider returns a value of zero (`0') or `N_INVALID' (`-1UL') for
     `DDATA_size', it is indicating that disconnection data is not permitted
     with the `N_DISCON_REQ' primitive.  When the SCCP provider returns the
     same value as `NSDU_size', it is indicating that normal data is permitted
     with the `N_DISCON_REQ' primitive.

  5. SCCP conforming NSP will return a value in the `NIDU_size' field that is
     less than or equal to the `NSDU_size' field, but must not be set to
     `N_INVALID' (`-1UL') or zero (`0').(1)

  6. SCCP conforming NSP will return a value in the `NODU_size' field that is
     less than or equal to the `NSDU_size' field, but must not be set to
     `N_INVALID' (`-1UL') or zero (`0').(2)

  7. SCCP conforming NSP will return the size of the sockaddr structure in the
     `ADDR_size' field.

 Rules for provider type:
.........................

  1. When the stream is bound and `MTP_CONNECTION_ORIENTED' or
     `MTP_CONNECTIONLESS' flags were set in the `N_BIND_REQ', the service type
     will be set according to the requested service type.  (See *note
     N_BIND_REQ:: and *note N_BIND_ACK::.)

  2. When neither `MTP_CONNECTION_ORIENTED' nor `MTP_CONNECTIONLESS' flags are
     set in the `N_BIND_REQ', or the stream is unbound, the SCCP conforming NSP
     will return a service type of `CLNS' when bound to non-call-related SCCP
     Users.  The SCCP conforming NSP will return a service type of `CLNS' for
     the following SCCP Users:
        * SCCP--Signalling Connection Control Part

        * MTUP--SCCP Test User Part

        * GCP--Gateway Control Protocol

        * Any other non-call-related SCCP User specified by the appropriate
          specification.

  3. When neither `MTP_CONNECTION_ORIENTED' nor `MTP_CONNECTIONLESS' flags are
     set in the `N_BIND_REQ', or the stream is unbound, the SCCP conforming NSP
     will return a service type of CONS when bound to call related SCCP Users.
     The SCCP conforming NSP will return a service type of CONS for the
     following SCCP Users:
        * TUP--Telephone User Part

        * NUP--Network User Part

        * ISUP--ISDN User Part

        * DUP--Data User Part

        * B-ISDN--Broadband ISDN User Part

        * S-ISDN--Satellite ISDN User Part

        * SPNE UP--Signal Processing Network Equipment User Part

        * AAL2 STC--AAL Type 2 STC

        * BICC--Bearer Independent Call Control

        * Any other call-related SCCP User specified by the appropriate
          specification.

  4. SCCP conforming NSP will not return a service type of COTS_ORD.

 Rules for flags:
.................

  1. Because the SCCP does not support receipt confirmation, the SCCP
     conforming NSP will not set the `REC_CONF_OPT' flag in the `OPTIONS_flags'
     field.

  2. Because the SCCP does not support expedited data, the SCCP conforming NSP
     will not set the `EX_DATA_OPT' flag in the `OPTIONS_flags' field.

 Rules for states:
..................

  1. Because SCCP only supports pseudo-connections, the SCCP conforming NSP
     will never return a `CURRENT_state' of `NS_WRES_CIND', `NS_WACK_CRES',
     `NS_WACK_DREQ6', `NS_WACK_DREQ7' or `NS_WACK_DREQ11'.

  2. Because SCCP does not support the reset service from the SCCP-User, the
     SCCP conforming NSP will never return a `CURRENT_state' of `NS_WCON_RREQ'.

 Rules for Quality of Service Parameters
........................................

  1. SCCP conforming NSP will retrun an `N_QOS_SEL_INFO_MTP' structure
     indicated in the `QOS_length' and `QOS_offset' fields.

  2. SCCP conforming NSP will return an `N_QOS_RANGE_INFO_MTP' structure
     indicated in the `QOS_range_length' and `QOS_range_offset' fields.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Typically, the `NIDU_size' will be the same value of the `NSDU_size' for
normal SS7 links.  For ATM and High-Speed SS7 liks, the `NIDU_size' will
typically be smaller than the `NSDU_size' when the maximum SIF size supported
by the link is greater than the maximum size of an M_DATA message block.

(2) Typically the `NODU_size' field will be equal to the `NIDU_size' field.

 GNU Free Documentation License
===============================



                        GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE
                            Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 PREAMBLE
=========

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the
document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with
manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.  But this License
is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
     placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the
     terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any such manual
     or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
     "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
     and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
     Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
     authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
     matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
     subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
     relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject
     or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical
     or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
     designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
     that the Document is released under this License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
     Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
     Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
     public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
     pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
     drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
     automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
     formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
     markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
     by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
     "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
     without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
     using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
     designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
     proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
     processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
     generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
     such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
     License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats which
     do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
     most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of
     the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
     notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
     Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
     conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use technical
     measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
     copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in
     exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies
     you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
     may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
     copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
     Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
     cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
     publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
     with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
     other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to
     the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
     these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
     you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
     actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
     than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
     along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
     publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
     Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
     general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
     option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
     distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
     copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
     Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
     them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
     conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
     Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
     filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
     modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
     In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
          from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
          should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
          Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if the
          original publisher of that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
          responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
          Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
          Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
          Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
          to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
          giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
          terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
          and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it
          an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher
          of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
          section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the
          title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its
          Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as
          stated in the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
          public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
          network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
          based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You may
          omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
          years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
          version it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications", preserve
          the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance
          and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments and/or
          dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
          their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent
          are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not
          be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict
          in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
     that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
     Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
     as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
     Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be
     distinct from any other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
     example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
     an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
     passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
     Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
     and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
     by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text for the
     same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
     entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
     that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
     permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
     endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
     License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
     provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
     of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
     Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
     identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.  If there
     are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
     make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
     parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
     if known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
     section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
     the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in
     the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History";
     likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgments", and any sections
     entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections entitled
     "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
     released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
     License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
     the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
     verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
     it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
     License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
     respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
     independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
     distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of
     the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
     compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
     License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
     with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are
     not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
     of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the
     entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
     surround only the Document within the aggregate.  Otherwise they must
     appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
     translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing
     Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
     their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
     Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
     Sections.  You may include a translation of this License provided that you
     also include the original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English version of
     this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
     expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to copy,
     modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
     automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
     who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
     compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
     Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
     similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.  See `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.  If
     the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
     "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
     version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
     Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version number of this
     License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
=====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections" instead
of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write
"no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for
Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free
software.
