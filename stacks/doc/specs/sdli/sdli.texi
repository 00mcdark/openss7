@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
@cpindex STREAMS

This document specifies a @cite{STREAMS}-based kernel-level instantiation of the ITU-T
@value{MANUAL_TITLE} definition.  The @value{MANUAL_TITLE} enables the user of a a signalling data
link service to access and use any of a variety of conforming signalling data link providers without
specific knowledge of the provider's protocol.  The service interface is designed to support any
network signalling data link protocol and user signalling data link protocol.  This interface only
specifies access to signalling data link service providers, and does not address issues concerning
signalling data link management, protocol performance, and performance analysis tools.

This specification assumes that the reader is familiar with ITU-T state machines and signalling data
link interfaces (e.g.  Q.703, Q.2210), and @cite{STREAMS}.

@node The Signalling Data Link Layer
@chapter The Signalling Data Link Layer

@menu
* Model of the SDLI::
* SDLI Services::
* Purpose of the SDLI::
@end menu

The Signalling Data Link Layer provides the means to manage the association of SDL-Users into
connections.  It is responsible for the routing and management of data to and from signalling data
link connections between SDL-user entities.

@node Model of the SDLI
@section Model of the SDLI
@cpindex STREAMS

The SDLI defines the services provided by the signalling data link layer to the signalling data link
user at the boundary between the signalling data link provider and the signalling data link user
entity.  The interface consists of a set of primitives defined as @cite{STREAMS} messages that
provide access to the signalling data link layer services, and are transferred between the SDLS user
entity and the SDLS provider.  These primitives are of two types; ones that originate from the SDLS
user, and other that originate from the SDLS provider.  The primitives that originate from the SDLS
user make requests to the SDLS provider, or respond to an indication of an event of the SDLS
provider.  The primitives that originate from the SDLS provider are either confirmations of a
request or are indications to the CCS user that an event has occurred.  @figref{1} shows the model
of the SDLI.

@figuresized{sdli01,1,Model of the SDLI,3.0in}

The SDLI allows the SDLS provider to be configured with any signalling data link layer user (such as
a signalling data terminal application) that also conforms to the SDLI.  A signalling data link
layer user can also be a user program that conforms to the SDLI and accesses the SDLS provider via
@command{@b{putmsg}(2s)} and @command{@b{getmsg}(2s)} system calls.  The typical configuration,
however, is to place a signalling data terminal module above the signalling data link layer.

@node SDLI Services
@section SDLI Services

The features of the SDLI are defined in terms of the services provided by the SDLS provider, and the
individual primitives that may flow between the SDLS user and the SDLS provider.

The SDLI Services are broken into two groups: local management services and protocol services.
Local management services are responsible for the local management of streams, assignment of streams
to physical points of attachment, enabling and disabling of streams, management of options
associated with a stream, and general acknowledgement and event reporting for the stream.  Protocol
services consist of connecting a stream to a medium, exchanging bits with the medium, and
disconnecting the stream from the medium.

@subsection Local Management

Local management services are listed in @tabref{1}.

@tabfig{lmit01,1,Local Management Services}

The local management services interface is described in @ref{Local Management Services}, and the
primitives are detailed in @ref{Local Management Service Primitives}.  The local management services
interface is defined by the @file{ss7/lmi.h} header file (@pxref{LMI Header File Listing}).

@subsection Protocol

Protocol services are listed in @tabref{2}.

@tabfig{sdlit02,2,Protocol Services}

The protocol services interface is described in @ref{Protocol Services}, and the primitives are
detailed in @ref{Protocol Service Primitives}.  The protocol services interface is defined by the
@file{ss7/sdli.h} header file (@pxref{SDLI Header File Listing}).

@node Purpose of the SDLI
@section Purpose of the SDLI

The SDLI is typically implemented as a device driver controlling a TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)
device that provides access to channels.  The purpose behind exposing this low level interface is
that almost all communications channel devices can be placed into a @emph{raw} mode, where a bit
stream can be exchanged between the driver and the medium.  The SDLI provides a interface that, once
implemented as a driver for a new device, can provide complete and verified SS7 signalling link
capabilities by pushing generic SDT (Signalling Data Terminal) and SL (Signalling Link) modules over
an open device stream.

This allows SDT and SL modules to be verified independently for correct operation and then simply
used for all manner of new device drivers that can implement the SDLI interface.

@node Acknowledgement Service
@subsection Acknowledgement Service

The acknowledgement service provides the LMS user with the ability to receive positive and negative
acknowledgements regarding the successful or unsuccessful completion of services.

@itemize @bullet

@item @b{@prim{LMI_OK_ACK}}:
The @prim{LMI_OK_ACK} message is used by the LMS provider to indicate successful receipt and
completion of a service primitive request that requires positive acknowledgement.

@item @b{@prim{LMI_ERROR_ACK}}:
The @prim{LMI_ERROR_ACK} message is used by the LMS provider to indicate successful receipt and
failure to complete a service primitive request that requires negative acknowledgement.

@end itemize

A successful invocation of the acknowledgement service is illustrated in @figref{15}.

@figuresized{lmi15,15,Message Flow: Successful Acknowledgement Service,4.0in}

As illustrated in @figref{15}, the
service primitives for which a positive acknowledgement may be returned are the
@prim{LMI_ATTACH_REQ} and @prim{LMI_DETACH_REQ}.

An unsuccessful invocation of the acknowledgement service is illustrated in @figref{16}.

@figuresized{lmi16,16,Message Flow: Unsuccessful Acknowledgement Service,4.0in}

As illustrated in @figref{16}, the service primitives for which a negative acknowledgement may be
returned are the @prim{LMI_INFO_REQ}, @prim{LMI_ATTACH_REQ}, @prim{LMI_DETACH_REQ},
@prim{LMI_ENABLE_REQ}, @prim{LMI_DISABLE_REQ} and @prim{LMI_OPTMGMT_REQ} messages.

@node Information Reporting Service
@subsection Information Reporting Service

The information reporting service provides the LMS user with the ability to elicit information from
the LMS provider.

@itemize @bullet

@item @b{@prim{LMI_INFO_REQ}}:
The @prim{LMI_INFO_REQ} message is used by the LMS user to request information about the LMS
provider.

@item @b{@prim{LMI_INFO_ACK}}:
The @prim{LMI_INFO_ACK} message is issued by the LMS provider to provide requested information about
the LMS provider.

@end itemize

A successful invocation of the information reporting service is illustrated in @figref{2}.

@figuresized{lmi02,2,Message Flow: Successful Information Reporting Service,4.0in}

@node Physical Point of Attachment Service
@subsection Physical Point of Attachment Service

The local management interface provides the LMS user with the ability to associate a stream to a
physical point of appearance (@dfn{PPA}) or to disassociate a stream from a PPA.  The local
management interface provides for two styles of LMS provider:

@subsubheading Style 1 LMS Provider

A @dfn{Style 1} LMS provider is a provider that associates a stream with a PPA at the time of the
first @manref{open(2)} call for the device, and disassociates a stream from a PPA at the time of the
last @manref{close(2)} call for the device.

Physical points of attachment (PPA) are assigned to major and minor device number combinations.
When the major and minor device number combination is opened, the opened stream is automatically
associated with the PPA for the major and minor device number combination.  The last close of the
device disassociates the PPA from the stream.

Freshly opened @dfn{Style 1} LMS provider streams start life in the @psta{LMI_DISABLED} state.

This approach is suitable for LMS providers implemented as real or pseudo-device drivers and is
applicable when the number of minor devices is small and static.

@subsubheading Style 2 LMS Provider

A @dfn{Style 2} LMS provider is a provider that associates a stream with a PPA at the time that the
LMS user issues the @prim{LMI_ATTACH_REQ} message.  Freshly opened streams are not associated with
any PPA.  The @dfn{Style 2} LMS provider stream is disassociated from a PPA when the stream is
closed or when the LMS user issues the @prim{LMI_DETACH_REQ} message.

Freshly opened @dfn{Style 2} LMS provider streams start life in the @psta{LMI_UNATTACHED} state.

This approach is suitable for LMS providers implemented as clone real or pseudo-device drivers  and
is applicable when the number of minor devices is large or dynamic.

@menu
* PPA Attachment Service::
* PPA Detachment Service::
@end menu

@node PPA Attachment Service
@subsubsection PPA Attachment Service

The PPA attachment service provides the LMS user with the ability to attach a @dfn{Style 2} LMS
provider stream to a physical point of appearance (PPA).

@itemize @bullet

@item @b{@prim{LMI_ATTACH_REQ}}:
The @prim{LMI_ATTACH_REQ} message is issued by the LMS user to request that a @dfn{Style 2} LMS
provider stream be attached to a specified physical point of appearance (PPA).

@item @b{@prim{LMI_OK_ACK}}:
Upon successful receipt and processing of the @prim{LMI_ATTACH_REQ} message, the LMS provider
acknowledges the success of the service completion with a @prim{LMI_OK_ACK} message.

@item @b{@prim{LMI_ERROR_ACK}}:
Upon successful receipt but failure to process the @prim{LMI_ATTACH_REQ} message, the LMS provider

@section Protocol Services

Protocol services are specific to the Signalling Data Link interface.  These services consist of
connection services that permit the transmit and receive directions to be connected to or
disconnected from the medium, and data transfer services that permit the exchange of bits between SDLS
users.

The service primitives that implement the protocol services are described in detail in @ref{Protocol
Service Primitives}.

@menu
* Connection Service::
* Data Transfer Service::
* Disconnection Service::
@end menu

@node Connection Service
@subsection Connection Service

The connection service provides the ability for the SDLS user to connect to the medium for the
purpose of transmitting bits, receiving bits, or both.  In SS7, this is a Level 1 function, possibly
the responsibility of multiplex or digital cross-connect switch.

@itemize @bullet

@item @b{@prim{SDL_CONNECT_REQ}}:
The @prim{SDL_CONNECT_REQ} message is used by the SDLS user to request that the stream be connected to
the medium.  Connection to the medium might require some switching or other mechanism to prepare the
stream for data transmission and receiption.  Connections can be formed for the receive direction or
the transmit direction independently.

@end itemize

A successful invocation of the connection service is illustrated in @figref{11}.

@figuresized{sdli11,11,Message Flow: Successful Connection Service,4.0in}

@node Data Transfer Service
@subsection Data Transfer Service

The data transfer service provides the SDLS user with the ability to request that bits be
transmitted on the medium, and the SDLS provider with the ability to indicate bits that have been
received from the medium.

@itemize @bullet

@item @b{@prim{SDL_BITS_FOR_TRANSMISSION_REQ}}:
The @prim{SDL_BITS_FOR_TRANSMISSION_REQ} message is used by the SDLS user to place raw bits onto
the medium.  The stream must have first been successfully activated in the transmit direction using
the @prim{SDL_CONNECT_REQ} message.

@item @b{@prim{SDL_RECEIVED_BITS_IND}}:
The @prim{SDL_RECEIVED_BITS_IND} message is issued by the SDLS provider when activated for the
receive direction with the @prim{SDL_CONNECT_REQ} message, to indicate bits received on the medium.

@node Disconnection Service
@subsection Disconnection Service

The disconnection service provides the ability for the SDLS user to disconnect from the medium,
withdrawing from the purpose of transmitting bits, receiving bits, or both.  It allow allows the
SDLS provider to autonomously indicate that the medium has been disconnected from the stream.  In
SS7, this is a Level 1 function, possible the responsibility of a multiplex or digital cross-connect
switch.

@itemize @bullet

@item @b{@prim{SDL_DISCONNECT_REQ}}:
The @prim{SDL_DISCONNECT_REQ} message is used by the SDLS user to request that the stream be

@subsection Initialization Service Primitives

Initialization service primitives allow the LMS user to enable or disable the protocol service
interface.  Enabling the protocol service interface may require that some action be taken to prepare
the protocol service interface for use or to remove it from use.  For example, where the PPA
corresponds to a signalling data link identifier as defined in Q.704, it may be necessary to perform
switching to connect or disconnect the circuit identification code associated with the signalling
data link identifier.

These service primitives implement the initialization service (@pxref{Initialization Service}).

@node Diagnostics Requirements
@chapter Diagnostics Requirements

Two error handling facilities should be provided to the SDLS user: one to handle non-fatal errors,
and the other to handle fatal errors.

@section Non-Fatal Error Handling Facility

These are errors that do not change the state of the SDLS interface as seen by the SDLS user and
provide the user with the option of reissuing the SDL primitive with the corrected options
specification.  The non-fatal error handling is provided only to those primitives that require
acknowledgements, and uses the @prim{LMI_ERROR_ACK} to report these errors.  These errors retain the
state of the SDLS interface the same as it was before the SDL provider received the primitive that
was in error.  Syntax errors and rule violations are reported via the non-fatal error handling
facility.

@section Fatal Error Handling Facility

These errors are issued by the SDL provider when it detects errors that are not correctable by the
SDL user, or if it is unable to report a correctible error to the SDLS user.  Fatal errors are
indicated via the STREAMS message type @msg{M_ERROR} with the UNIX system error @errno{EPROTO}.  The
@msg{M_ERROR} STREAMS message type will result in the failure of all the UNIX system calls on the
stream.  The SDLS user can recover from a fatal error by having all the processes close the files
associated with the stream, and then reopening them for processing.
