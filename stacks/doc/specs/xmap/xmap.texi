@node Overview
@section Overview

The XOM Mobile Application Part Application Programming Interface (abbreviated XMAP) defines an
Application Program Inteface (API) to mobile application services.  It is referred to as @dfn{the
interface} throughout this specification.

The interface is designed to offer services that are consistent with, but not limited to, the 3GPP
TS 29.002 and ITU-T Recommendation Q.711 standards.  These standards were published in 1997 and have
been stable for many years.

The interface is also designated to offer services that are consistent with the EIA/TIA ANSI-41D
standards for CDMA mobile networks.

All of the above standards are referred to in this document as @dfn{the Standards}.

Access to other mobile application services through the API is not prohibited, but has not been
explicitly considered.

The interface is designed to be used and implemented in conjunction with the use and implementation
of the general-purpose XOM API (@ref{XOM}).

A brief introduction to Mobile Application Services is given in @ref{Introductory Concepts}.
Following this is an overview of OSI-Abstract-DATA Manipulation OM, which provides the Data
Abstraction service as defined in the XOM specification (@ref{XOM}).  Then the optional features of
this specification are described, and the chapter closes with a list of abbreviations.  In all cases
the reader should refere to the Standards (@ref{TCAP}, @ref{GSM MAP}), or to the XOM Specification
(@ref{XOM}) for further authoritative details.

The structure of the remaining chapters and appendices is described in the @ref{Preface}.

@node Format of the Specification
@section Format of the Specification

This specification describes a programming language-independent interface to the Mobile Application
Services together with a specific C language binding of that interface.  Several conventions are
used to identify particular items.  The general conventions are described in the @ref{Preface},
while the C language binding conventions are described in @ref{C Language Binding}.

* XMAP and the MAP Provider::
@end menu

@node Relationship to MAP Protocols
@subsection Relationship to MAP Protocols

The interaction between mobile application programs acting in a mobile application entity role are
realized throught the exchange of mobile application service information.  The general
communications service for the mobile applications is the @dfn{Mobile Application Part}.  MAP
defines the following operations:

@multitable @columnfractions .5 .5
@item @b{Service} @tab @b{Type}
@end multitable

This communication may be accomplished using the ITU-T or ANSI @dfn{Transaction Capabilities
Application Part} protocol.

@node XMAP and the MAP Provider
@subsection XMAP and the MAP Provider

The XMAP interface provides access to the MAP service provider, which offers all of the facilities
defined in the Standards.  It also provides facilities such as automatic association management and
automatic dialog handling.  The interface is designed not to restrict the services offered to those
of specific service packages of GSM MAP.

The interface defined in this specification is ``symmetrical'' in the sense that it can be used to
implement mobile application programs acting in any of the MAP producer or consumer roles (e.g, HLR,
VLR).  The interface supports:

@itemize
@item a mobile application program acting as a consumer of mobile application services.  This is
done by submitting service operation requests and receiving service operation responses.
@item a mobile application program acting as a producer of mobile application services.  This is
done by receiving service operation requests and sending back service operation responses.
@end itemize

The interface provides the ability to send @dfn{requests} on the consumer side and to receive
@dfn{indications} on the producer side within a mobile service interaction.  Furthermore, if the
service is confirmed, the producer will be able to send back @dfn{responses} that will be received
as @dfn{confirmations} by the consumer.

@node Relationship to GSM and ANSI MAP
@section Relationship to GSM and ANSI MAP

The API is essentially based on the abstract services fo the GSM MAP and ANSI MAP, but is
independent of the underlying communications stack.  The API allows the manipulation of ITU-T and
ANSI mobile application service information.  Thus this API does not preclude and does not force the
use of either the GSM MAP protocol or the ANSI MAP protocol.

The XMAP API offers two abstract mobile application service views: the one of GSM and the one of
CDMA.

The contents of GSM MAP messages are described in 3GPP TS 29.002.  These messages implicitly define
GSM MAP services.  The mapping between GSM MAP services and various service primitives and
parameters of the XMAP API are described below.

The services offered by the XMAP API are a superset of those defined both by GSM MAP and ANSI MAP.
The general communication protocol for ANSI MAP is the TCAP as specified in ANSI T1.114/2000.  The
general communication protocol for GSM MAP is the TCAP as specified in ITU-T Recommendation series
Q.771 through Q.775.

The two abstract mobile application views of XMAP (GSM MAP and ANSI MAP) are independent of the
underlying protocol.  However, the ITU-T view on top of ANSI TCAP requires that an appropriate
mapping of GSM MAP services over ANSI TCAP is widely available.

@node Relationship to Data Abstraction Services
@section Relationship to Data Abstraction Services

XMAP is dependent on standard data abstraction services to ensure portability of management software
written to the XMAP specification.  XMAP functions pass most arguments by reference.  The data
referenced by these arguments is modelled and manipulated in an object-oriented fashion.  Mobile
application data abstraction services are provided by the XOM API (@ref{XOM}).

The definitions below introduce the various concepts that are used by Mobile Application data
abstraction services.

@table @dfn
@item Syntax
A @dfn{syntax} is the classification and representation of values in OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation.
Examples of syntaxes are @i{Boolean}, @i{Integer}, @i{Real}, @i{String(Octet)},
@i{String(Object-Identifier)} and @i{Object}.

@item Value
A @dfn{value} is a single datum, or piece of information.  A value may be as simple as a Boolean
value (for example, @i{True}), or as complicated as an entire OM object (for example, a
@i{Message}).

@item OM Attribute
An @dfn{OM attribute type} is an arbitrary category into which a specification places some values.
An @dfn{OM attribute} is an OM Attribute Type, together with an ordered sequence of one or more
values.  The OM Attribute Type can be thought of as the name of the OM attribute.

@item OM Object
An @dfn{OM object} is a collection of OM attributes.

@item OM Class
An @dfn{OM class} is a category of OM objects set out in a specification.  It determines the OM
attributes that may be present in the OM object, and details the constraints on those OM attributes.

@item Package
A @dfn{Package} is a set of OM classes that are grouped together by the specification, because tey
are functionally related (for example, GSM service package).

@item Package Closure
A @dfn{Package-Closure} is the set of classes that need to be supported to be able to create all
possible instances of all classes defined in the package.  Thus an OM Class may be defined to have
an OM Attribute whose value is an OM Obejct of an OM Class that is defined in some other package,
but within the same @dfn{Package-Closure}.

@item Workspace
A @dfn{workspace} is allocated storage that contains one or more @dfn{Package-Closures}, together
with an implementatin of the Mobile Application data abstraction services, that supports all the OM
classes of OM objects in the @dfn{Package-Closures}.

@item Descriptor
A @dfn{descriptor} is a defined data structure that is used to represent an OM Attribute Type and a
single value.  The structure has three components: a type, a syntax and a value.

@item Public Object
@dfn{Public Objects} are represented by data structures that are manipulated directly using
programming language constructs.  Use of Public Objects therefore simplifies programming by this
direct access and by enabling objects to be statically defined, when appropriate.  Programs can
efficiently access public objects.

@item Private Objects
@dfn{Private Objects} are held in data structures that are private to the service and can only be
accessed from programs indirectly using interface functions.  They are of particular use for
structures that are infrequently manipulated by programs, being passed by reference to the service,
which can then manipulate them efficiently.  An example of such objects in XMAP is the @i{session}
object.
@end table

@node Mandatory and Optional Features
@section Mandatory and Optional Features

The interface defines an Application Program Interface (API) that application programs can use to
access the functionality of the underlying Mobile Application Services.  The interface does not
define or imply any profile of that service.

Note that nothing in this specification requires that the implementation of the interface or the
Mobile Application Services itself acutally makes use of TCAP or other parts of the model, just so
long as it provides the defined service.  Also, the @emph{scope} of the Mobile Application Services
to which an application has access is not determined; it is not restricted to GSM MAP operations.

Some OM attributes are optional: these are marked @emph{(Optional Functionality)} in the OM class
definitions.  They are:

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{File-Descriptor} in a @b{Session} object.
@end itemize

Some items of behaviour of the interface and a number of aspects of the Mobile Application Services
provider are implemetnation-defined.  These are:

@itemize
@item the maximum number of oustanding asynchronous operations
@item whether an asyncrhonous function call returns before the operation is submitted to the Mobile
Application Services provider
@item the text and language of error messages
@item the OM classes permitted as values of the
@c @b{Name},
@b{Address} and @b{Title} argument to
interface functions.
@end itemize

The default values of some OM attributes on OM object @b{Session} are locally administered.

This API assumes the provision of automatic association management and automatic dialog handling by
the MAP provider.

The interface enables negotiation of the use of the various defined features of the MAP provider and
those of the interface.

@node Packages
@section Packages

The specification defines three Mobile Service packages (Common MAP package, GSM MAP package and
ANSI MAP package), @ref{Interface Class Definitions}.  These packages define the OM classes required
by the interface functions to perform GSM MAP or ANSI MAP services.  The Common MAP package, which
also includes the errors defined (@pxref{Errors}), is mandatory.  The GSM MAP package and the ANSI
MAP package are optional, but at least one of them must be supported by the implementation.  The
ITU-T service view and the ANSI service view assume the support of the corresponding GSM MAP or ANSI
MAP package by the implementation.

The use of the optional packages is negotiated using the @command{Negotiate()} function.

@node Terminology
@section Terminology

The terms @dfn{implementation-defined}, @dfn{may}, @dfn{should}, @dfn{undefined}, @dfn{unspecified},
and @dfn{will} are used in this document with the meanings ascribed to them in reference @b{XPG4},
see also @ref{Glossary}.

* C Naming Conventions::
* Use and Implementtion of Interfaces::
* Function Return Values::
* Compilation and Linking::
@end menu

This chapter sets out certain characteristics of the C language binding to the interface.  The
binding specifies C identifiers for all the elements of the interface, so that application programs
written in C can access the Mobile Application Services.  These elements include function names,
@var{typedef} names and constants.  All of the C identifiers are mechanically derived from the
language independent names as explained below.  There is a complete list of all the identifiers in
@ref{C Headers}.  For ease of use, some of these identifiers are defined in the specification
alongside the language-independent name.

A @prim{Function()} is indicated as shown.

A @pval{CONSTANT} is in Roman font.

The names of @perr{[ERRORS]} and other return codes are surrounded by square brackets.

The definitions of the C identifiers appear in four headers:

@ftable @b
@item <xom.h>
This header file contains definitions for the associated OM interface.

@node C Naming Conventions
@section C Naming Conventions

The interfaces uses part of the C public namespace for its facilities.  All identifiers start with
the letters map, MAP or OMAP, and more detail of the conventions used are given in the following
table.  Note that the interface reserves @emph{all} identifiers starting with the letters @var{mapP}
for private (i.e. internal) use by implementations of the interface.  It also reserves @emph{all}
identifiers starting with the letters @var{mapX} or @var{MAPX} for vendor-specific extensions of the
interface.  Application programmers should not use any identifier starting with these letters.

The OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation API uses similar, thorugh not identical, naming conventions, that
are described in XOM (@pxref{XOM}).  All its identifiers are prefixes by the letters @var{OM} or
@var{om}.

@multitable @columnfractions .5 .2
@item reserved for implementors @tab @var{mapP}

@item OM value length limits @tab @var{MAP_VL_}
@item OM value number limits @tab @var{MAP_VN_}
@item other constants @tab @var{MAP_}
@end multitable

A complete list of all identifiers used (except those beginning @var{mapP}, @var{mapX}, @var{MAPX}
or @var{OMAP}) is given in @ref{C Headers}.  No implementation of the interface will use any other
public identifiers.  A @dfn{public identifier} is any name except those reserved in section 4.1.2.1
of the ISO C Standard, and the @dfn{public namespace} is the set of all possible public identifiers.

The C identifiers are derived from the langauage-independent names used throughput this
specification by a purely mechanical process which depends on the kind of name:

@itemize @bullet
@item Interface function names are made entirely lower-case and prefixed by @var{map_}.  Thus
@b{Service-Req()} becomes @command{map_service_req()}.

@item C function parameters are derived from the argument and result names by making them entirely
lower-case.  In addition, the names of results have @var{_return} added as a suffix.  Thus the
argument @b{Session} becomes @var{session}, while the result of @b{Result} becomes
@var{result_return}.

@item OM class names are made entirely upper-case and prefixed by @var{MAP_C_}.  Thus
@b{Service-Argument} becomes @var{MAP_C_SERVICE_ARGUMENT}.  Note that the symbolic OM class names
are strictly those used in the abstract syntax ASN.1 of the TCAP and MAP with the exception that
names containing multiple words are separated by hyphens.

@item Enumeration tags are derived from the name of the corresponding OM type and syntax by
prefixing @var{MAP_}.  The case of letters is left unchanged.  Thus @b{Enum(User-reason)}
befomes @var{MAP_User_reason}.

@item Enumeration constants, except erros, are made entirely upper-case and prefixed by @var{MAP_T_}.
Thus @b{resource-limitation} becomes @var{MAP_T_RESOURCE_LIMITATION}.

@item The name of an OM attribute is local to its OM class, that measn the same name of an OM
attribute may appear in different OM classes, for exmpale, OM attribute @b{application-Context-Name}
is defined in both OM classes @b{Open-Arg} and @b{application-Context-List}.
Independent-language atribute @b{application-Context-Name} appears as
@var{MAP_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_NAME} in C-language.  Note that the symbolic OM attribute names are
strictly those used in the abstract syntax ASN.1 of the TCAP and MAP with the exception that names
containing multiple words are separated with hyphens.

@item Errors are treated as a special case.  Constants that are the possible values of the OM
attribute @b{Error-Status} of a subclass of the OM class @b{Error} are made entirely upper-case and
prefixed by @var{MAP_E_}.  Thus @b{invalid-session} becomes @var{MAP_E_INVALID_SESSION}.

@item The constants in the @b{Value Length} and @b{Value Number} columns of the OM class definition
tables are also assigned identifiers.  (They have no names in the language-independent
specification.)  Where the upper limit in on eof these columns is not ``1'' (one), it is given a
name consisting of the OM attribute name, prefixed by @var{MAP_VL_} for value length, or
@var{MAP_VN_} for value numbers.


@item The sequence of octets for each object identifier is also assigned an identifier, for internal
use by certain OM macros.  These identifiers are all upper case and are prefixed by @var{OMP_O_}.
See reference @b{XOM} for further details on the use of object identifiers.

Note that hyphens are translated everywhere to underscores.

@end itemize

@node Use and Implementtion of Interfaces
@section Use and Implementtion of Interfaces

Each of the following statements applies unless explicitly state otherwise in the detailed
descriptions that follow:

If an argument to a function has an invalid value (such as a value outside the domain of the
function, or a pointer outside the address space of the program, or a null pointer), the behvaiour
is @dfn{undefined}.

Any function declared in a header may be implemented as a macro defined in the header, so a library
function should not be declared explicitly if its header is included.  Any macro definition of a
function can be suppressed locally be encoding the name of the function in parentheses, because the
name is not then followed by the left parthesis that indicate expansion of a macro function name.
For the same syntactic reason, it is permitted to take the address of a library function even if it
is also defined as a macro.  The use of @command{#undef} to remove any macro defintion will also
ensure that an actual function is referred to.  Any invocation of a library function that is
implemented as a macro will expand to code that evaluates each of its arguments exactly once, fully
protected by parentheses where necessary, so it is generally safe to use arbitrary expressions as
arguments.  Likewise, those function-like macros described in the following sections may be invoked
in an expression anywhere a function with a compatible return type could be called.

@node Function Return Values
@section Function Return Values

The return value of a C function is always bound to the result of the language-independent
description.  Functions return a value of @type{MAP_stats}, which is an error indication.  If and
only if the function succeeds, its value will be @b{success}, expressed in C by the constant
@var{MAP_SUCCESS}.  If a function returns a status other than this, then it has not updated the
return parameters.  The value of the status, in this case, is an error as described in @ref{Errors}.
In most cases the integer returned in @b{Status} is sufficient for error processing.  However, in a
few cases additional information is available if desired.

Since C does not provide multiple return values, functions must return all other results by writing
into storage passed by the application program.  Any argument that is a pointer to such storage has
a name ending with @var{_return}.  For example, the C parameter declaration @samp{OM_sint
*invoke_id_return} in the @i{Service-Req()} function indicates that the function will return an
signed integer @b{Invoke-Id} as a result, so the actual argument to the function must be the address
of a suitable variable.  This notation allows the reader to distinguish between an input parameter
that happes to be a pointer, and an output parameter where the @key{*} is used to simulate the
semantics of passing by reference.

@node Compilation and Linking
@section Compilation and Linking

All applications programs that use this interface include the @file{<xom.h>} and @file{<xmap.h>}
headers in that order, and at least one of the @file{<xmap_gsm.h>} and @file{<xmap_ansi.h>} headers.

@end menu

The interface comprises a number of functions together with many OM classes and OM objects that are
used as the arguments and results of the functions.  Both the functions and the OM objects are based
closely on the @dfn{Abstract Service} that is specified in the Standards (references GSM MAP and
ANSI MAP).

The interface models mobile application interactions as service requests made through a number of
interface @dfn{functions}, which take a number of input @dfn{arguments}.  Each valid request causes
an @dfn{operation} within the producer which eventually returns a @dfn{status} and any @dfn{result}
of the operation.

All interactions between a Consumer and a Producer belong to a @dfn{session}, which is represented
by an OM object passed as the first argument to most interface functions.

The other arguments to the function include a @dfn{context} and various service-specific arguments.
The @dfn{context} includes a number of parameters that are common to many functions and that seldom
change from operation to operation.

Each of the components of this model is described below, along with other features of the interface
such as asynchronous function calls and security.

@node Services Description
@section Services

@menu
* Negotiation Sequence::
* Names, Addresses and Titles: Names.
@end menu

As mentioned above, the Standards define Abstract Services that Consumers and Producers use.
Each of these Absract Services maps to a single function call with the same name.  The services are
@b{Service-req} and @b{Service-rsp}.

@c FIXME more here...

These are three functions called @i{Receive()}, @i{Wait()}, and @i{Abandon()} which have no
counterpart in the Abstract Service.  @i{Receive()} is used to receive indications and results of
asynchronous operations, and is explained in @ref{Interface Functions}.  @i{Wait()} is used to
suspend execution until indications are available for specified sessions.  @i{Abandon()} is used to
abandon locally the result of a pending asyncrhonous operation.  Two additional functions
@i{Bind()}@footnote{@xref{Bind}.} and @i{Unbind()} are used to open and close a user-session.

There are also other interface specific functions called @i{Get-Assoc-Info()}, @i{Get-Last-Error()},
@i{Validate-Object()}, @i{Error-Message()}, @i{Initialize()}, @i{Shutdown()} and @i{Negotiate()}.

The detailed specifications are given in @ref{Interface Functions}.
@ignore
The interface functions are summarized in Table 3.1.  Those interface functions that can execute
asynchronously are indicated by an @samp{a} in the first column.  The function @i{Cancel-req()} can
only be used asynchronously.  An @samp{s} in the second column indicates that the function addresses
the corresponding TCAP, GSM MAP or ANSI MAP service while an @samp{i} references a specific
interface service.
@end ignore

@node Negotiation Sequence
@subsection Negotiation Sequence

The interface has an initialize and shutdown sequence that permits the negotiation of optional
features.  This involves the functions @i{Initialize()}, @i{Negotiate()}, and @i{Shutdown()}.

Every application program must first call @i{Initialize()}, that returns a workspace.  This
workspace supports only the standard Common MAP package, @xref{Interface Class Definitions}.

The workspace can be extended to support either the GSM MAP or ANSI MAP package or both (see
@ref{Interface Class Definitions}, and any combination of the optional Mobile Application Services
packages), or any vendor extensions.  Vendor extensions may include additional packages, and may
also include additional or modified functionality.  All such packages or other extensions are
identified by means of OSI Object Identifiers, and the Object Identifiers are supplied to the
@i{Negotiate()} function to incorporate the extensions into the workspace.  Features defined by this
specification are described and assigned Object Identifiers in @ref{Interface Functions}.  A feature
represents any package or any additional or modified functionality that is subject to negotiattion.
The @i{Negotiate()} function allows some particular features to be made available.

After a worksapce with the required features has been negotiated in this way, the application can
use the workspace as required.  It can create and manipulate OM objects using the OM functions, and
can start one or more management sessions using @i{Bind()}.@footnote{@xref{Bind}.}  All the sessions on a given workspace
share the same features.

Eventually, when it has completed its tasks, terminated all is mobile application sessions using
@i{Unbind()}, and released all its OM objects using @i{OM-Delete()}, the application should ensure
that resources associated with the interface are freed by calling @i{Shutdown()}.

A miscellaneous error arises if an attempt is made to use an unavailable feature.  If an instance of
a class that is not in an available package is supplied as a function argument, the @b{bad-class}
error arises.

@node Names
@section Names, Addresses and Titles

To address a wide variety of mobile application transport protocols the interface is capable of
accepting various forms of object names, system addresses and program or system titles.

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{Name} is an ``abstract class'' that contains various subclass types used to define specific
subscribers or systems responsible for producing mobile application services.

@item @b{Address} is an ``abstract class'' that contains various subclass types used to define the
specific location to contact a particular consumer or producer of mobile services.  For example, the
SCCP-Address subclass is typically used to define the location of a producer or consumer.

@item @b{Title} is an ``abstract class'' that contains various subclass types used to define a
specific subscriber or system name reponsible for producing mobile application services.
@end itemize

All three abstract classes participate in an implementation-specific name resolution scheme.  It is
assumed that given a @b{Name}, an implementation can determine the @b{Title} responsible for that
@b{Name}.  It is also assumed that given a @b{Title}, an implementation can determine the
@b{Address} of that @b{Title}.@footnote{Note that the way in which these relationships are resolved
is implementation-dependent, but use of SCCP Global Title translations should play a significant
role.}

The producer of an invoked operation may be explicitly designated at the interface boundary using
the following precedence rules:

@enumerate
@item A default Title or Address may be supplied as parameters to a bound ``session''.  If both
are provided, the implementation will verify that the Title resolves to the Address.
@item If automatic association management is used, a provider Title or Address may be supplied
as parameters within the ``context'' or a specific operation request.  If both are provided, the
implementation will verify that the Title resolves to the Address.  The ``context'' Title or or
Address takes precedence over the ``session'' Title or Address for unassociated session objects.
@item A consumer address may be supplied as a parameter within the ``argument'' of a specific
operation request.  The ``argument'' Address takes precedence over either the ``session'' Title or
Address or the ``context'' Title or Address.
@item If the producer of an invoked operation is not explicitly designated at the interface
boundary, the implementation will resolve the Name to the appropriate Title or Address.
@end enumerate

@node Session Description
@section Session

@menu
* AAM Enabled Session::
* AAM Disabled Session::
* Associated Session::
* ADH Enabled Session::
* ADH Disabled Session::
@end menu

A session identifies to which mobile application entity a particular operation will be sent.  It
contains some @b{Bind-Arguments}, such as the name of the consumer.  The session is passed as the
first argument to most interface functions.

A session is described by an OM object of OM class @b{Session}.  It is created, and appropriate
parameter values may be set, using the OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation functions.  A mobile
application session is then started with @i{Bind()}@footnote{@xref{Bind}.} and later is terminated with @i{Unbind()}.  A
session with default parameters can be started by passing the constant @b{Default-Session}
(@samp{(OM_object)MAP_DEFAULT_SESSION}) as the @b{Session} argument to @i{Bind()}.

@i{Bind()} must be called before the @b{Session} can be used as an argument to any other function in
the interface.  After @i{Unbind()} has been called, @i{Bind()} must be called again if another
session is to be started.

The interface supports multiple concurrent sessions, so that an application implemented as a single
process, such as a server in a client-server model, can interact with the Mobile Application
Services using several identities; and so that a process can interact directly and concurrently with
different mobile application services.

Detailed specifications of the OM class @b{Session} are given in @ref{Interface Class Definitions}.

A session can be used either acting as a consumer of mobile application services, or acting as a
producer of mobile application services, or both.

A session acn be restricted for use only with a designated program called the responder.  When the
responder is omitted and automatic association management is used, the session can be used to
exchange mobile application service information with all processes.

The responder (title and address) parameters of an opened session, if present, specifies the
producer of the requested operation.  The precedence rules on address and title of the responder are
described in @ref{Names}.

Other OM attributes (vendors' implementation extensions) may be included to specify characteristics
of the underlying protocol used.

There are three type of session objects:

@node AAM Enabled Session
@subsection AAM Enabled Session

The @b{Session} collects together all the information that described a particular management
interaction.  The parameters that are to control such a session are set up in an instance of this OM
class, which is then passed as an argument to @i{Bind()}.@footnote{@xref{Bind}.}  This sets the OM attributes that describe
the actual characteristics of the session, and starts the session.  Such a started session can be
passed as the first argument to interface functions.

No attribute of a bound or connected session may be changed.  The result of modifying a started
session is unspecified.

Finally, @i{Unbind()} is used to terminate the sesion, after which the parameters can be modified an
a new session started using the same instance, if required.  Multiple concurrent sessions can be
run, by using multiple instances of this OM class.

A session allows a requesting program (the requestor) to exchange mobile application information
with another program designated (the responder) or by default to all programs.

An @dfn{AAM enabled} session thus allows a mobile application entity to access either a portion of
the mobile application services (that is, that are accessible via the designated responder) or all
mobile application services.  In the later case, the producer mobile application entity resolution
is performed by the Mobile Application Service provider, according to the mobile application
services invoked.

This type of session object can not be used to receive or send ACSE related primitives or
operations explicitly.  The use ACSE explicitly, see @ref{AAM Disabled Session}.

@node AAM Disabled Session
@subsection AAM Disabled Session

A session object can have Automatic Association Management disabled when it belongs to a workspace that has
Automatic Association Management disabled via @i{Negotiate()}, which allows the user to explicitly send and
receive ACSE operations to build and tear down associations.  It gives explicit control over
associations to the user.  The Mobile Application Service provider does no ACSE operations on behalf
of the user.

When the user creates and binds a session object in a workspace with AAM disabled, only the
following attributes within the session object can be specified:

@itemize
@item @i{requestor-Address}
@item @i{requestor-Title}
@c @item @i{role}
@end itemize

The session object is then passed as an argument to @i{Bind()},@footnote{@xref{Bind}.} which binds
the session.  This bound session can only be used to send ACSE related operations an to receive ACSE
related primitives.  The following can be sent/received using this type of bound session:

@itemize
@item @i{Receive()} (@command{map_receive()}/@samp{MAP_ASSOC_IND})
@item @i{Receive()} (@command{map_receive()}/@samp{MAP_ASSOC_CNF})
@item @i{Assoc-req()} (@command{map_assoc_req()})
@item @i{Assoc-rsp()} (@command{map_assoc_rsp()})
@end itemize

The other attributes that relate to ACSE are specified within an @b{Assoc-Argument} or
@b{Assoc-Result} object that is passed to, or returned from, @i{Assoc-req()}, @i{Assoc-rsp()}, or
@i{Receive()}.

@node Associated Session
@subsection Associated Session

Once a user has created a bound session that has AAM disabled, an association can be created.  An
association is represented by an @dfn{associated} or @dfn{partially associated} session object.  An
@dfn{associated} session is returned as the result of building a new association.  The associated
session is used, like a bound session, by sending and receiving mobile application dialog handling
or service operations.  The major difference is that an associated session object can only be used
to send and receive operations to, or from, a single remote mobile application entity.  After a
session is associated, the user can abort the association, which implicitly unbinds the associated,
or partialyl associated, session.

The precedence rules for common parameters within the @b{Session} and the @b{Context} objects are
different for associated session objects.  Once a session is in the associated state; the
@var{responder-Address} and @var{responder-Title} cannot be overridden by the context object.

To terminate this type of session, the user should either abort the session, which implicitly
unbinds the session.  If the user unbinds the associated session prior to aborting the association,
the service provider will abort the association.

@node ADH Enabled Session
@subsection ADH Enabled Session

The ADH enabled session allows a mobile application entity to invoke and respond to mobile
application services requests and indications without regard for dialog handling.  The Mobile
Application Service provider provides all dialog handling.

This type of session cannot be used to send dialog handling primitives or operations explicitly.
To use dialog handling explicitly, see @ref{ADH Disabled Session}.

@node ADH Disabled Session
@subsection ADH Disabled Session

A session object can have Automatic Dialog Handling disabled when it belongs to a workspace that has
Automatic Dialog Handling disabled using the @i{Negotiate()} function.  This allows the user to
explicitly send and receive dialog handling operations to establish and tear down dialogs.  It gives
explicit control over dialogs to the user.  The Mobile Application Service provider does no dialog
handling operations on behalf of the user.

Once the session object is bound (AAM enabled) or associated (AAM disabled) and has ADH disabled,
the session must explicitly issue dialog handling operations for each mobile application service
request or response.  This bound or associated session can only be used to send dialog handling
primitives.  The following can be sent/received using this type of bound or associated session:

@itemize
@item @i{Receive()} (@command{map_receive()}/@samp{MAP_OPEN_IND})
@item @i{Receive()} (@command{map_receive()}/@samp{MAP_ACCEPT_CNF})
@item @i{Receive()} (@command{map_receive()}/@samp{MAP_REFUSE_CNF})
@item @i{Open()} (@command{map_open()})
@item @i{Accept()} (@command{map_accept()})
@item @i{Refuse()} (@command{map_refuse()})
@end itemize

The other attributes that relate to dialog handling are specified within the @b{Open-Argument},
@b{Accept-Result} or @b{Refuse-Result} objects that are passed to, or returned from, @i{Open()},
@i{Accept()}, @i{Refuse()}, or @i{Receive()}.

@node Dialog Session
@subsection Dialog Session

Once a user has created a bound or associated session that has ADH disabled, a dialog can be
created.  A dialog is represented by a @dfn{fully formed}, or @dfn{partially formed} @dfn{dialog},
session object.  A @dfn{dialog} session is returned as the result of building a new dialog.  The
dialog session is used, like a bound or associated session, by sending and receiving mobile
application service operations.  The major difference is that a dialog session object can only be
used to send and receive operations within a single dialog with a single remote mobile application
entity.  After a session forms a dialog, the user can close or abort the dialog, which returns the
session to the bound or associated state.

The precedence rules for common parameters within the @b{Session} and the @b{Context} objects are
different for dialog session objects.  Once a session has formed a dialog, the dialog related
arguments, @var{application-Context-Name}, cannot be overridden by the context object.

To terminate this type of session, the user should either abort or close the dialog, which
implicitly unbind the session.  If the user unbinds the dialog session prior to either closing or
aborting the dialog, the service provider will first attempt to close the dialog, and if that is
rejected, will abort the dialog.

@node Context Description
@section Context

The context defines the characteristics of the mobile application interaction that are specific to a
particular mobile application operation, but are often used unchanged for many operations.  Since
the parameters are presumed to be relatively static for a given user during a particular mobile
application interaction, these arguments are collected into an OM object of OM class @b{Context},
which is supplied as the second argument of each mobile application operation.  This serves to
reduce the number of arguments passed to each function.

The context includes various administrative details, such as the @i{mode} defined in the Abstract
Service, which affect the processing of each mobile application operation.  These include a number
of @i{Service Controls} and @i{Local Controls} that allow control over some aspects of the
operation.
The @i{Service Controls} include
@b{mode}, @b{responder-Address}, and @b{responder-Title}.
The @i{Local Controls} include
@b{asynchronous}, @b{reply-Limit} and @b{time-Limit}.
Each of these is mapped onto an OM attribute in the @b{Context}, and they are detailed in
@ref{Interface Class Definitions}.

The effect is as if they were passed as a group of additional arguments on every function call.  The
value of each component of the context is determined when the interface function is called, and
remains fixed throughout the operation.

The precedence rules on address and title of the responder are described in @ref{Names}.

Some of the OM attributes in the @b{Context} have default values, some of which are locally
adminstered.  The constant @b{Default-Context} (@samp{MAP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT}) can be pased as the
value of the @b{Context} argument to the interface functions, and has the same effect as a context
OM object created with default values.  The context must be a private object, unless it is
@b{Default-Context}.

Detailed specifications of the OM class @b{Context} are given in @ref{Interface Class Definitions}.

@node Function Arguments
@section Function Arguments

@menu
* Encoding and Decoding::
* Argument and Response::
@end menu

The Abstract Service defines specific arguments for each operation.  These are mapped onto
coresponding arguments to each interface function (which are aso called input parameters).  Although
each service has different arguments, some specific arguments recur in several operations; these are
briefly introduced here.  As far as the GSM MAP package is concerned, OM classes are defined with a
one-to-one mapping to the ASN.1 Abstract Syntax of GSM MAP.  Full details of these and all the other
arguments are given in the function definitions in @ref{Interface Functions}, and the OM class
definitions in @ref{Interface Class Definitions}.

All arguments that are OM objects can generally be supplied to the interface functions as public
objects (i.e, descriptor lists) or as private objects.  Private objects must be created in the
workspace that was returned by @i{Initialize()}.  In some cases, constants can be supplied instead
of OM objects.

Note that wherever a function is stated as accepting an instance of a particular OM class as the
value of an argument, it will also accept an instance of any subclass of that OM class.  For
example, the @b{Service-Req} function has a parameter @b{argument}, which accepts values of OM class
@b{Service-Argument}.  Any of the subclasses of @b{Service-Argument} may be supplied as the value of
@b{argument}.

Rules for interpretation of @samp{ANY} syntax appearing in function arguments are defined in
@ref{Encoding and Decoding}.

@node Encoding and Decoding
@subsection Encoding and Decoding

XMAP specifies two alternatives for encoding and decoding of Mobile Application Packages
OM-Attribute values of type @samp{ANY}, or any OM-Attribute values in a Mobiled Application Services
package.

@enumerate
@item The encoding and decoding functionality can be provided internally with the XMAP API, without
requiring the application to invoke any encoding or decoding functions.  This option allows the
application to be free from any knowledge of encoding rules.  In this case, the OM class and
attribute type and corresponding representation are defined in a mobile application or services
package.  The XMAP API uses the package definition to attempt encoding or decoding; if automatic
decoding fails, an OM String(Encoding) is used.
@item The application can perform encoding and decoding itself.  This option gives the application
responsibility and control over the encoding and decoding of OM attributes.  In this case, all OM
attribute values appear as an OM String(Encoding).
@end enumerate

The encoding and decoding alternative to be used is negotiated through the @i{Negotiate()} function;
@xref{Negotiate}.

The XMAP API does not specify the use of OM-Encode or OM-Decode for the OM classes defined in this
specification, or in mobile application or services packages used with this specification.

To ensure interoperability, the sender and receiver must follow the same encoding rules when
converting between OM syntax and encoded syntax.  If an algorithm is used to generate OM packages,
then the algorithm must ensure that the generated OM syntax is consistent with the input abstract
syntax (that is, the same encoded values must result from applying the encoding rules to either
representation).  The encoding rules used with the GSM MAP and ANSI MAP packages defined by this
specification are ANS.1 BER.  This does not imply that other encoding rules cannot be used with
other packages defined in the future.

For the API to encode and decode the OM attribute values according to the ASN.1 standard scheme,
ASN.1 taggin information must be stored for each OM object and each OM attribute.  Thus, the package
definitions in the workspace need to incorporate the ASN.1 tagging information for each OM object
and each OM attribute definition for all Mobile Application Services packages.

As a minimum, the following requirements apply:

@itemize @bullet
@item All rules specified in ISO/IEC 8825 -- Specification of Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract
Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) shall be adhered to.  Any exceptions or restrictions must be stated.
@item ASN.1 tagging information must be retained for each OM object and each OM attribute in the
Mobile Application Services packages.
@item The specified encoding and decoding scheme (and any implementation thereof) should be
extensible to accomodate the new encoding rules established subsequent to ISO/IEC 8825.

Most operations and notifications take an argument to specify the argument of the operation and a
response when issuing the response of the operation.  These arguments and responses are specified to
accept values of OM classes that are consistent with the abstract service view (GSM MAP or ANSI MAP)
of the current operation.

The argument for a @i{Service-req()} function is represented by an instance of the OM Class
@b{GSM-Service-Req-Argument} for a GSM MAP operation or an instance of the OM Class
@b{ANSI-Service-Req-Argument} for an ANSI MAP operation.

The reponse for a @i{Service-rsp()} function is represented by an instance of the OM Class
@b{GSM-Service-Result}, @b{GSM-Linked-Reply-Argument} @b{Service-Error} or
@b{GSM-Service-Reject} to represent the possible responses of the GSM service request operation, or
an instance of the @b{ANSI-Service-Result}, @b{ANSI-Linked-Reply-Argument} @b{Service-Error} or
@b{ANSI-Service-Reject} to represent the possible responses of the ANSI service request operation.

@node Function Results
@section Function Results

All functions return a @b{Status} (which is the C function result).  Most return an @b{Invoke-ID}
which identfies the particular invocation.  The confirmed operations each return a @b{Result}.  (The
@b{Invoke-ID} and @b{Result} are returned using pointers that are supplied as arguments of the C
function).  These three kinds of function results are introduced below.

All OM objects returned by interface functions (results and errors) will be private objects in the
workspace assocaited with the session private object.

@node Invoke-ID Discussion
@subsection Invoke-ID

All interface functions that invoke a mobile application service operation return an @b{Invoke-ID};
an integer that identifies the particular invocation of an operation.  The @b{Invoke-ID} is only
relevant for asynchronous confirmed operations and may be used later to receive the @b{Status} and
@b{Result}, or to abandon them.  The @b{Invoke-ID} is also used to respond to a previously requested
confirmed operation.  Asynchronous operations are fully described in @ref{Synchronous and
Asynchronous Operation}.  The interface functions that can be used to start them are the
@i{Service-req()} function.

The numerical value of the invoke-Id returned from a call that successfully invoke an asynchronous
confirmed operation is guaranteed to be unique amoungst all outstanding operations in given session.
The value is such as could be returned from TCAP, the Transaction Capabilities Application Part
defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.771 through Q.775.  Invoke IDs used by XMAP are not necessarily
those that are actually sent via a protocol such as TCAP.  Invoke IDs may be mapped or altered by
the Mobile Application Service provider.

The value returned for a synchronous operation or an asynchronous non-confirmed operation is
unspecified, as is that for a call that fails to invoke an operation.

@node Result Discussion
@subsection Result

Functions invoking confirmed mobile application service operations return a result only if they
succeed.  All errors from these functions are reported in the @b{Status} described below, as are
errors from all other functions.

The value returned by a function call that invokes an asynchronous operation is unspecified, as is
that for a call that fails to invoke an operation.  The result of an asynchronous operation is
returned by a later call to @i{Receive()}.

The result of a function invoking a confirmed operation can be composed of a single reply, or of
multiple linked replies.  In the later case, the term @dfn{partial result} is used to designate one
of these linked replies.  Only a confirmed @b{Service-req} may produce multiple results.  Multiple
replies to a single mobile application service operation may only occur if the invoker specifies
multiple-reply in the functional unit attribute of the Session object.

In asynchronous mode, the partial results can be retrieved one at a time by subsequent calls to
@i{Receive()}, which each time returns an instance of OM class @b{Linked-Reply-Argument}.  In
synchronous mode, the function returns an instance of OM class @b{Multiple-Reply}, which contains a
list of sub-objects of OM class @b{Linked-Reply-Argument}.

The result (or partial result) of an operation is returned in a private object whose OM class is
appropriate to the particular operation.  The format of mobile application service operation results
is driven both by the Abstract Service and by the need to provide asynchronous execution of
functions.  To simplify processing of asynchronous results, the result (or partial result) of a
single operation is returned in a single OM obejct (corresponding to the abstract result defined in
the Standards).  The components of the result (or partial result) of an operation are represented by
OM attribute in the operation's result object.  All information contianed in the Abstract Service
result is made available to the application program.  The result (partial result) is inspected using
the functions provided in the OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation API.

Only confirmed mobile application service operations produce results, and each type of operation has
a specific OM class of OM object for its result.  These OM classes are defined in @ref{Interface
Class Definitions}.

The actual OM class of the result can always be a subclass of that named, to allow flexibility for
extensions.  Thus, the function @i{OM-Instance()} should always be used when testing the OM class.

@node Status Discussion
@subsection Status

Every interface function returnes a @b{Status} value, which is either the constant @b{success}
(@samp{(MAP_status)0} or @samp{MAP_SUCCESS}) or an error.  Function call errors are represented as
integer constants and grouped in categories of System, Library and Communications as described in
@ref{Errors}.

Additional error information is available for System and Communications errors via the
@i{Get-Last-Error()} function call.  Additional error information is available for the
@b{bad-argument} Library error via the @i{Validate-Object()} function call.

A synchronous call with multiple linked replies is considered successful unless the reploy limit or
time limit is exceeded.  The function returns a @b{Status} value equal to success, and the argument
@i{Result} is an OM object of OM class @b{Multiple-Reply}, which contains all the linked replies.

It should be noted that OM object @b{Linked-Reply-Argument} may contain an OM attribute that
reflects an error.

If the reply limit or time limit is exceeded, the synchronous call fails and returns a status of the
appropriate Library error.  However, the @i{Result} is still considered valid and may contain an
OM-Object @b{Multiple-Reply}, which contains all the received linked replies.  A result of
@var{MAP_ABSENT_OBJECT} means no replies were received.

In most cases other results of functions are initialized to Null (@var{MAP_ABSENT_OBJECT}) if the
status does not have the value @b{success}.  However, the @i{Result} is still considered valid and
may contain an OM-Object of parital replies.  A result of @var{MAP_ABSENT_OBJECT} means no replies
were received.

@node Synchronous and Asynchronous Operation
@section Synchronous and Asynchronous Operation

The asynchronous or synchronous mode of a requested operation is specified at the interface, and
determined for each operation by the value of the OM attribute @i{Asynchronous} in the @b{Context}
passed to the interface function.  The default value of this OM attribute is @b{false}, causing all
operations to by synchronous.  Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operation is mandatory.
There is a limit to the number of pending asynchronous operations; this limit is given by the
constant @b{max-outstanding-operations}, and has a minimum value of 10.

In synchronous mode, all functions wait until the operation is complete before returning.  Thus the
thread of control is blocked within the interface after calling a function, and the application can
make use of the result immediately after the function returns.

In asynchronous mode, some functions return before the operation is complete.  The application is
then able to continue with other processing while the operation is being executed by the Mobile
Application Service provider, and can then access the result by calling @i{Receive()}.  An
application may initiate several concurrent asynchronous operations on the ame session before
receiving any of the results, subject to the limit described below.  The results are not guaranteed
to be returned in any particular order.  The functions that can execute asynchronously are the
@i{Service-req()} function.  This correponds to the mobile application services of the Standards
that operate in a confirmed mode.  Moreover, only confirmed operations return service results.

An asynchronous function call of a confirmed service returns an @b{Invoke-ID} of the operation to
the application.  The same @b{Invoke-ID} will be returned by @i{Receive()} on the corresponding
result.

An @b{Invoke-ID} is also returned by @i{Receive()} on an indication of an invoked mobile application
service operation.  The same @b{Invoke-ID} will be used to respond to this operation.

Implementations of the interface are free to return from asynchronous function calls as soon as
possible or may wait until the operation has been submitted to the unerlying Mobile Application
Service provider.  The actual policy used is implemetnation-defined.

Implementations will define a limit to the number of asyncrhonous operations that may be outstanding
at any one time on any one session.  An asynchronous operation is outstanding from the time that the
function is called until the last reply of the result is returned by @i{Receive()}, or the operation
is abandoned by @i{Abandon()}, or the session is closed by @i{Unbind()}.  The limit is given by the
constant @b{max-outstanding-operations} (@samp{MAP_MAX_OUTSTANDING_OPERATIONS}) and is at least 10
for conformant XMAP implemetnations.  While this number of operations is outstanding, attempts to
invoke further asynchronous operations will report a @b{Library-Error} (too many operations).

Asynchronous operation calls can be aborted by executing an @i{Abandon()} or @i{Unbind()} call.  In
this case, the operation is no longer outstanding and the result  will never be returned by further
@i{Receive()} function calls.

If an error is detected before an asynchronous request is submitted to the Mobile Application
Service provider, the function will return immediately and there will be no outstanding operation
generated.  Other errors are notified later by @i{Receive()}, when the result of the outstanding
asynchronous confirmed operation is returned.  All errors occurring during a synchronous request are
reported when the function returns.  Full details of error handling are given in @ref{Errors}.

Where vendors provide suitable system primitives (such as System V @manref{poll(2)}, or BSD
@manref{select(2)}), applications can obtain a file descriptor from the @b{Session} by inspecting
the value fo the OM attribute @i{File-Descriptor}.  Applications may use the file descriptor to
suspend the process until data is received on the particular file descriptor.

Applications should ensure that there are no outstanding asynchronous operations on a session when
@i{Unbind()} is called on that session.  Once @i{Unbind()} has been called there is no way to
determine whether any outstanding operations succeed or even whether they were ever sent to the
Mobile Application Service provider.  Also no errors or results of any kind will be reported to the
application.  It is strongly recommended that @i{Receive()} is called repeatedly until
@b{Completion-Flag} takes the value @b{nothing}.

@end menu

These features are not part of the interface itself, but are mandatory when specified by the Mobile
Application Service provider.

The Mobile Applications are not restricted to those defined by GSM MAP.

All the features listed below are for the most part necessary for ease of use in a mobile
application environment.  These features are classified as given registered identifiers (Object
Identifier).  They can be negotiated using the @i{Negotiate()} function in the same manner as
packages.  Other types of information that are critical in servicing an environment that incudes
implemetnation from multiple vendors on various machines can also be classified and handled with
the @i{Negotiate()} function.  Features defined by this specification are described and assigned
Object Identifiers in @ref{Interface Functions}.

@node Automatic Association Management
@subsection Automatic Association Management

When the Mobile Application Services provider makes use of association oriented communication services,
such as TCAP, the Mobile Application Service provider implementations are assumed to provide
automatic handling of the association between mobile application entities, establishing
and releasing associations at its discretion.  Such management is intended to bring
benefits such as reduced communication charges.  To allow this flexibility to the implementation,
the interface does not specify when communication takes place.  Automatic Association Management
(AAM) may be enabled or disabled on a per-workspace basis using the @i{Negotiate()} function. 

@node Automatic Dialog Handling
@subsection Automatic Dialog Handling

When the Mobile Application Services provider makes use of dialog oriented communication services,
such as that provided by TCAP, the Mobile Application Service provider implementations are assumed
to provide automatic handling of dialogs between mobile application entities, establishing and
releasing dialogs at its discretion.  Such management is intended to bring benefits such as reduced
communication overheads.  To allow this flexibility to the implementation, the interface does not
specify when communication takes place.  Automatic Dialog Handling (ADH) may be enabled or disabled
on a per-workspace basis using the @i{Negotiate()} function.@footnote{Note that Automatic Dialog
Handling is an independent concept from Automatic Association Management.}

@node Automatic Performer Resolution
@subsection Automatic Performer Resolution

The performer of an invoked operation my be explicitly designated by the responder name and
responder address parameters of the bound session used.

However, in the case where the responder is specified as a wildcard, the Mobile Application Service
provider may be assumed to provide automatic mobile application service and application context to
consumer resolution: to find out the consumer that is in charge of the selected mobile application
service specified in the mobile application service operation.

@node Responder Versatility
@subsection Responder Versatility

Responder versatility is the ability to change the consumer within a same bound-session at each
function call.  It is useful when the automatic consumer resolution is either not suported by the
Mobile Application Service provider or note requested.  This applies if the underlying Mobile
Application Service provider is connection-less.

@node Automatic Name to Address Resolution
@subsection Automatic Name to Address Resolution

Mobile Application Service provider implementation may provide automatic resolution between program
name and address to find the network address of a mobile application entity from its name using
directory or translation services.

@node Automatic Dispatching to Appropriate Stack
@subsection Automatic Dispatching to Appropriate Stack

The Mobile Application Services provideer implementation may provide a loop back facility if the
destination of the operation or notification is local.  It also may provide routing of the
mobile application services operation to the proper underlying communications stack according to the
implied mobile application service and the destination (for example over a ITU-T SCCP stack or an
ANSI SCCP stack).

@node Function Sequencing
@section Function Sequencing

A minimum set of sequencing rules applies when using the interface to exchange mobile application
service information between mobile application programs acting as a mobile application entity.
These rules need to be respected by mobile application programs to ensure that interface
functions are called in the proper sequence and that the state of the interface is not violated,
otherwise @b{Library-error} status will be returned.@footnote{Note the following is considered as
tutorial information.  The definitive information is contained in the Standards (see referenced
documents).}

The general rules to follow are:

@enumerate
@item Initialize a workspace (@samp{map_initialize()})
@item Negotiate features of the interface (@samp{map_negotiate()})
@item Open one or several sessions (@samp{map_bind()})
@item Perform mobile application service interactions (operations) using the offered interface
functions.  An interaction is identified by its @b{Invoke-Id}.
@item Close the opened sessions (@samp{map_unbind()})
@item Discard the workspace (@samp{map_shutdown()})
@end enumerate

Seven states are defined in the interface to cover both interface service operations and mobile
application service interactions:


@table @var
@item UNINIT
Workspace uninitialized.
@item INIT
Workspace initialized.
@item UNBND
Session closed.
@item BND
Session opened.
@item IDLE
Outstanding operatoin requested in a mobile application service interaction.
@item OUTOP
Operation indication received in a mobile application service interaction.

MAP_status map_abandon(
        OM_private_object  session,
        OM_sint32          invoke_id
);
@end verbatim
@item DESCRIPTION
This function abandons the result of an outstanding asynchronous function call.  The function is no
longer outstnading after this function returns, and the result (or the remaining results in case of
multiple linked replies) will never be returned by @i{Receive()}.

@i{Abandon()} may, but need not, cause the Mobile Application Service provider to abandon the
outstanding asyncrhonous operation itself (as opposed to simply discarding the result).  Note that
the specified behaviour is a local mater, and no statement is made about underlying mobile
application service operations that may or may not be abandoned.

This function can only be called in synchronous mode.
@item ARGUMENTS
@table @i
@item Session (Object(Session))
The mobile application esessino in which the confirmed operation was requested.  This must be a
private object previously returned from @i{Bind()}.@footnote{@xref{Bind}.}

@item Invoke-ID (Integer)
Selects the specific outstanding asynchronous operation submitted via the @b{Session} to be
termianted.  The outstanding operation may be a non-confirmed service.  In that case the abandon is
without effect.  The value of @b{Invoke-ID} must be that which was returned by the function call
that initniated the asyncrhonous management operation that is now to be abandonned.
@end table
@item RESULTS
@table @i
@item Status (Status)
Indicates whether or not the abandon function succeeded.
@end table
@item ERRORS
This function can return a @b{System-Error} or one of the following @b{Library-Errors}: bad-class,
bad-session, bad-procedural-use, miscellaneous, session-terminated.

This function can return a @b{Communications-Error}.

Note that the abandon function is successful even if the operation to be abandonned does not exist
(any longer) or is not confirmed.  The abandon is then without effect.

The function can also return the error constants @perr{[MAP_NO_WORKSPACE]},
@perr{[MAP_INVALID_SESSION]} and @perr{[MAP_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCE]}.

@end verbatim
@item DESCRIPTION
This function is one of a group of dialogue handling functions: @i{Open()}, @i{Accept()},
@i{Refuse()}, @i{Issue()}, @i{Close()}, @i{Abort()}, @i{Receive()}, used to manage the MAP dialogue
when AAM is disabled on a session.  When AAM is enabled on a session, this dialogue handling
function is neither necessary nor permitted.

This function is used to abort a mobile application session that is either associated or partially
associated.  The service is defined as an unconfirmed service: a reply is not expected.

Once an abort is issued, the associated session is implicitly disassociated and unbound.  All
outstanding requests that pertain to this session are returned with the error session-terminated.
This includes any @i{Wait()} request on that session.
@item ARGUMENTS
@table @i
@item Session (Object(Session))
The associated (or partially associated) session against which this operation is perfomed.  This
must be a private object previously returned as part of an @b{Accept-Result} or @b{Open-Argument},
or returned explicitly from an asyncrhonously called @i{Open()}.  This session object must have AAM
disabled.
@item Context (Object(Context))
The management context to be used for this operation.  This argument must be a private object.  Once
a session is connected or partially connected, the precedence rules for common parameters within the
@b{Session} and the @b{Context} objects are different.  Once connected, the responder address and
responder title cann not be overriden by the @b{Context} object.  (See also @ref{Names}.)
@item Argument (Object(Abort-Argument))
The information supplied as the argument of an @b{Abort} operation.  (See @ref{Abort-Argument}.)
@end table
@item RESULTS
As this function is not confirmed, there are no results returned.
@item ERRORS
This function can return a @b{Communications-Error}, or one of the following @b{Library-Errors}:
bad-argument, bad-class, bad-context, bad-session, miscellaneous, missing-type, session-terminated,
reply-limit-exceeded, time-limit-edceeded.

The function can also return the error constants @perr{[MAP_NO_WORKSPACE]},
@perr{[MAP_INVALID_SESSION]} and @perr{[MAP_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES]}.

@var{session-terminated}.  This includes any @i{Wait()} requests on that session.
@item ARGUMENTS
@table @i
@item Session (Object(Session))
The associated (or partially associated) session against which this operation is performed.  This
must be a private object previously returned as part of an @b{Assoc-Result} or @b{Assoc-Argument},
or returned explicitly from an asynchronously called @i{Assoc-req()}.  This session object must have
AAM disabled.
@item Context (Object(Context))
The mobile application context to be used for this operation.  This argument must be a private

@item Response (Object(Accept-Result))
The information supplied in acceptance of the previously indicated @b{Open} operation.
This is an instance of OM class @b{Accept-Result}, indicating that the open indication is to be
accepted.  The user provides negotiated ACSE parameters in this object as input to the service
provider.  A newly formed dialog object is returned in the @b{Accept-Result} object, so this is an
in/out parameter to this function.  The new @b{Session} object represents a fully formed dialog
session.
@item Dialog-ID (Integer)
The @b{Dialog-ID} of the requested dialog to which the reply applies.  This @b{Dialog-ID} must have
been returned from a call to @i{Receive()} for the corresponding association that is being accepted.
@end table
@item RESULTS
@table @i
@item Status (Status)
Indicates whether or not the @b{Accept} response was completed.
@item Connected-Session (Object(Session))
When successful, this function returns a newly connected session object.  The returned @b{Session}
object is in a connected state, and contains the final negotiated ACSE parameters for the new
association.

It is not specified whether the association has been formed by the underlying Mobile Application
Service provider at the time that this function returns.  The underlying Mobile Application Service
might wait until a @i{Issue()} function call before fully forming the association.  Nevertheless,
the association is considered to be in the ``connected'' state from the standpoint of the interface.

@item DESCRIPTION
This function is used to reply to a previously invoked @var{Assoc} operation.

This function can only be called in syncrhonous mode.
@item ARGUMENTS
@table @i
@item Session (Object(Session))
The mobile application session against which this operation is performed.
This must be a private object previously returned from @i{Bind()}.@footnote{@xref{Bind}.}
@item Context (Object(Context))
The mobile application context to be used for this operation.
This must be a private object or the constant @b{Default-Context} (@samp{MAP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT}).
@item Response (Object(Assoc-Result))
The information supplied as a response to an @b{Assoc} operation.  This is one of the following:
@itemize
@item When an association is accepted, one instance of the OM class @b{Assoc-Result} is given as the
response.  The user provides negotiated ACSE parameters in this object as input to the service
provider, and also indicates that the association is to be accepted by setting the
@var{assoc-Result} attribute to @b{accept}.  A newly associated session object is returned in the
@b{Assoc-Result} object, so this is an in/out parameter to this function.  The new @b{Session}
object is in an associated state, and contains the final negotiated ACSE parameters for the new
association.
@item When an association is to be rejected, one instance of the OM class @b{Assoc-Result} is given
as a response.  The @b{Assoc-Result} should have the @var{assoc-Result} attribute set to either
@b{reject-permanent} or @b{reject-transient}.  The @var{assoc-Diagnostic} can also optionally be set
to indicate why the reject has occurred.
@end itemize
@item Assoc-ID (Integer)
The @b{Assoc-ID} of the requested operation to which the reply applies.
@end table
@item RESULTS
@table @i
@item Status (Status)
Indicates whether or note the @b{Assoc} response was completed.

@verbatim
#include <xom.h>
#include <xmap.h>

MAP_status map_bind(
        OM_object           session,
        OM_workspace        workspace,
        OM_private_object  *bound_session_return
);
@end verbatim
@item DESCRIPTION
This function opens a mobile application session.  It creates a @b{Session} OM object describing the
session suitable for supplying to other XMAP functions.  A session must be opened before any
mobile application service interactions can take place.

If the OM attribute @b{requestor-Title} is specified, only one unconnected session can be opened
with the same value of the OM attribute.  There can be multiple connected or partially connected
session objects with the same @b{requestor-Title}.

To allow for the implementation of automatic association management, it is undefined as to whether
@i{Bind()} causes any communication with the remote management entity.
@item ARGUMENTS
@table @i
@item Session (Object(Session))
Specifies a program together with other details of the service required.  This argument may be
either a public object or a private object.  The constant @b{Default-Session}
(@samp{MAP_DEFAULT_SESSION}) may also be used as the value of this argument, causing a new session to
be created with default values for all its OM attributes.
@item Workspace (Workspace)
Sepcifies the workspace (obtained from a call to @i{Initialize()}) which is to be associated with
the session.  All function results from mobile application operations using this session will be
returned as private objects in this workspace.  If the Session argument is a private object, it must
be a private object in this workspace.
@end table
@item RESULTS
@table @i
@item Status (Status)
Indicates whether or not the function completed successfully.
@item Bound-Session (Object(Session))
Upon successful compltion, contains an instance of a mobile application session that may be used as
an argument to other functions (e.g. @i{Service-req()}).  This will be a new private object if the
value of @b{Session} was @b{Default-Session} or a public object, otherwise, it will be that supplied
as an argument.  In the later case, the session provided should not be already in use.  The function
will supply default values for any of the OM attribute that were not present in the @b{Session}
instance supplied as an argument.  It will also set the value of the @b{File-Descriptor} OM
attribute (the value will be @b{No-Valid-File-Descriptor} (@samp{MAP_NO_VALID_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}) if
the functionality is not supported).

When AAM is disabled with @i{Negotiate()}, any session bound using @i{Bind()} is unconnected and may
only be used to receive and send ACSE-related primitives, (i.e. it cannot be used for Mobile
Application Service operations).
@end table
@item ERRORS
This function can return a @b{System-Error} or one of the following @b{Library-Errors}: bad-address,
bad-session, bad-title, miscellaneous, not-supported, too-many-sessions.

This function can return a @b{Communications-Error}.

This function can also return the error constants
@perr{[MAP_NO_WORKSPACE]},
@perr{[MAP_INVALID_SESSION]} and
@perr{[MAP_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES]}.

@end verbatim
@item DESCRIPTION
This function is one of a group of dialogue handling functions: @i{Open()}, @i{Accept()},
@i{Refuse()}, @i{Issue()}, @i{Close()}, @i{Abort()}, @i{Receive()}, used to manage MAP dialogues
when AAM is disabled on a session.  When AAM is enabed on a session, this dialogue hanglin function
is neither necessary nor permitted.

This function is used to issue pending mobile application service requests and responses.  The
function can only be called in synchronous mode.

When an @i{Open()}, @i{Accept()} or @i{Refuse()} function is called, the underlying Mobile
Application Service provider might not issue the corresponding TCAP transactions immediately, but
may wait for the accumulation of mobile application service requests or responses to combine with
the dialogue.  The @i{Issue()} function tells the underlying Mobile Application Service provider to
release pending dialogue handling primitives with the service requests and responses currently
accumulated.

One typical order of dialogue handling function calls would be as follows:
@itemize
@item @i{Bind()} --- bind the session.
@item @i{Open()} --- open the dialogue.
@item @i{Service-req()} --- generate one or more service requests.
@item @i{Issue()} -- issue pending dialogue handing and accumulated service requests or responses.
@item @i{Service-req()} --- generate one or more service requests.
@item @i{Close()} --- close the dialogue (also issuing any pending dialogue handling and accumulated
service requests or responses).
@end itemize
@item ARGUMENTS
@table @i
@item Session (Object(Session))
The mobile application session against which this operation is to be performed.  This must be a

@item Context (Object(Context))
The mobile application context to be used for this operation.  This argument must be a private
object or the constant @b{Default-Context} (@samp{MAP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT}).
@item Dialog-ID (Integer)
The @b{Dialog-ID} of the requested dialog to which the reply applies.  This @b{Dialog-ID} must have
been returned from a call to @i{Receive()} for the corresponding association for which pending
service requests and responses are being issued.
@end table

@item DESCRIPTION
This function negotiates features of the interface; each feature is represented as an Object
Identifier.  Several features are defined and registered within this specification.  Features may
also include mobile application services packages, vendor extensions, and new features defined in
future versions of this specification.  Features can be negotiated after a workspace has been
initialized, and can be renegotiated any time until the workspace is discarded.  Note that all
sessions on a given workspace share the same features. 
@item ARGUMENTS
@table @i
@item Feature-List (Feature-List)
An ordered sequence of features, each represented by an object identifier and a request value.  The
request value can contain one of the following values: Activate, Deactivate, Query State, and Query
Supported.

The sequence is terminated by an object identifier having no components (a length of zero and a
value of the data pointer in the C representation).  The response value is returned upon completion
of the Negotiate invocation.

In the C binding, the Feature-List argument is a single array of structures of type
@type{MAP_feature}, which is defined as:

@smallexample
@verbatim
#define MAP_ACTIVATE            0

@item DESCRIPTION
This function is used to retrieve the argument of an invoked operation and to retrieve a partial
result (linked reply) or the completed result of a previous asynchronous operation.

The function results include two status indications.  One, called @b{Status}, indicates that the
function call itself was successful; it is always returned.  The other, called @b{Operation-Status},
is used to return the status of the completed asynchronous operation, and is only returned if there
is one.
@item ARGUMENTS
@table @i
@item Session (Object(Session))
The moble application session against which this mobile application operation is performed.  This
must be a private object previously returned from @i{Bind()},@footnote{@xref{Bind}.} or a connected
or partially connected session object returned from @i{Open()},@footnote{@xref{Open}.}
@i{Accept()},@footnote{@xref{Accept}.} or @i{Receive()}.
@end table
@item RESULTS
@table @i
@item Status (Status)
Takes an error value if one of the library errors or system errors listed below occurred during
execution of this function.  Takes the value @b{success} (@samp{MAP_SUCCESS}) if this function
returned successfuly.
@item Primitive (Integer)
The mobile application service primitives (@samp{MAP_SERVICE_IND}, @samp{MAP_SERVICE_CNF}).

The MAP association service primitves (@samp{MAP_OPEN_IND}, @samp{MAP_ACCEPT_CNF},
@samp{MAP_REFUSE_CNF}, @samp{MAP_DELIM_IND}, @samp{MAP_CLOSE_IND}, @samp{MAP_ABORT_IND},
@samp{MAP_P_ABORT_IND}).

Determines the operation of this result or argument.

This result is only valid if @b{Completion-Flag} has the value @b{completed}, @b{incoming} or
@b{partial}.
@item Mode (Integer)
This indicates the mode of an indication.  When @b{confirmed} (@samp{MAP_T_CONFIRMED}) the invoked
operation has to be confirmed, a reply is expected.  When @b{non-confirmed}
(@samp{MAP_T_NON_CONFIRMED}), the requested service is not to be confirmed.

This result is only valid if @b{Completion-Flag} has the value @b{incoming}.
@item Completion-Flag (Integer)
This flag indicates the statue of the received data, if any.

@itemize
@item @b{completed} (@samp{MAP_COMPLETED}) @*
This flag indicates that a @emph{final} response has been received.  For mobile application
primitives this may be the confirmation for a service request or the last confirmation of a linked
reply.  In the latter case, the @b{Result-Or-Argument} parameter will be the @b{Absent-Object}.
@item @b{incoming} (@samp{MAP_INCOMING}) @*
An indication has been received.
@item @b{nothing} (@samp{MAP_NOTHING}) @*
There are no indications or confirmations to receive.  Further, there are no outstanding
asynchronous requests.
@item @b{outstanding} (@samp{MAP_OUTSTANDING}) @*
There are no indications or confirmations to receive.  There are still outstanding requests, but no
confirmations have yet arrived.
@item @b{parial} (@samp{MAP_PARTIAL})
A confirmation has been received which is part of a linked reply.  This is used for all but the last
in a series of linked replies.  (See completed, above.)
@end itemize
This result is only valid if @b{Status} has the value @b{success}.  In that case, the validity of
the other results is given as follows:

@item Partial(3) @tab yes(1) @tab no @tab yes @tab yes(1) @tab yes
@end multitable
@item Operation-Status (Status)
Takes an error value if a communications error occurred during the execution of the asynchronous
operation, and @b{success} (@samp{MAP_SUCCESS}) otherwise.  The possible error values are listed for
each individual operation in the corresponding function description.

This result is only valid if @b{Completion-Flag} has the value @b{completed} or @b{partial}.
@item Result-or-Argument (Object(*))
This object contians the results of an asynchronous request, or information about an indication.
The class of object received is dependent upon the values of the @b{Primitive} and
@b{Completion-Flag} parameters.  The following table for the three applicable @b{Completion-Flag}
values.  The actual class returned is dependent on the value of @b{Primitive}.
@table @asis

@item Accept-Result @tab @samp{MAP_ACCEPT_CNF}
@item Refuse-Result @tab @samp{MAP_REFUSE_CNF}
@item Absent-Object @tab All confirmations.
@end multitable
Note that @b{Absent-Object} may be returned in two cases:
@enumerate
@item The confirmation contains no data.
@item As the terminator of a linked reply list.  In this case, the @b{Invoke-or-Dialog-ID} parameter
can be used to determine which linked reply has been terminated.
@end enumerate
@item @b{Completion-Flag} set to @b{incoming}:
@multitable @columnfractions .25 .25
@item Service-Argument @tab @samp{MAP_SERVICE_IND}

valid for @b{Completion-Flag} values of @b{nothing} or @b{outstanding}.
@item Invoke-or-Dialog-ID (Integer)
The Invoke-ID or Dialog-ID of the operation whose error, result or argument is being returned.

This result is only valid of the @b{Status} has the value @b{success} and @b{Completion-Flag} has
the value @b{completed}, @b{partial} or @b{incoming}.
@end table
@item ERRORS
This function can return a @b{System-Error} or one of the following @b{Library-Errors}: bad-class,
bad-context, bad-session, miscellaneous, session-terminated, time-limit-exceeded.

This function does not report any @b{Communication-Errors}, in its @b{Status} result.  (Any such
errors related to the completed asynchronous operation is reported in @b{Operation-Status}, as
described above.)

This function can also return the error constants
@perr{[MAP_NO_WORKSPACE]},
@perr{[MAP_INVALID_SESSION]} and
@perr{[MAP_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES]}.

prematurely.  For this reason it is recommended that all outstanding asynchronous operations are
processed using @i{Receive()} before @i{Unbind()} is called.

The unbound session may be used again as an argument to @i{Bind()} possible after modification by
the XOM functions (reference @b{XOM}).  When it is no longer required, it must be deleted using the

@item DESCRIPTION
This function is used to suspend the caller until a mobile application operation is available for a
bound Session.  A timeout value specifies the maximum number of milliseconds to suspend before
returning when no messages are available.  It should be noted that, in a multithreaded environment,
@i{Wait()} may report the presence of a message that will have been processed by another thread by
the time the first thread call @i{Receive()} to process it.
@item ARGUMENTS
@table @i
@item Bound_session_list (Bound-Session-List)
An ordered sequence of mobile application sessions to wait upon.  The last value must evaluate to
NULL.
@item Workspace (Workspace)
Specifies the workspace (obtained from a call to @i{Initialize()}, in which a @type{MAP_status}
object will be created if the return status is other than @perr{[MAP_SUCCESS]}.  Session(s)
specified in the @b{bound-session-list} do no need to be from this workspace.
@item Timeout (Integer)
The maximum number of milliseconds to suspend before returning when there are no messages from the
list of Session(s).  A value of zero specifies an indefinite timeout.
@end table
@item RESULTS
@table @i
@item Status (Status)
Indicates whether or not the function completed successfully.  A successful completion means that
either a message is available from a Session or that the timeout limit has been reached.  The
@i{Receive()} function must be called to determine whether a message is available.  (See note in
description above.)
@item Activated (Boolean-List)
If the function was completed successfully, this result is an ordered list of Boolean values, with
the same number of elements as the @b{bound-session-list}.  If true, each value indicates that the
corresponding Session has data waiting in queue.  If false, each valud indicates that the
corresponding Session does @emph{not} has data waiting in queue.

In the C binding, this result is combined with the @b{bound-session-list} argument as a single array
of structures of type @type{MAP_waiting_sessions}, which is defined as:
@smallexample
@verbatim
typedef struct {
        OM_private_object   bound_session;
        OM_boolean          activated;
} MAP_waiting_sessions;
@end verbatim
@end smallexample
@end table
@item ERRORS
This function can return one of the following @b{Library-Errors}: bad-address, bad-session,
bad-workspace, miscellaneous, session-terminated.

The function can also return the error constants @perr{[MAP_NO_WORKSPACE]},
@perr{[MAP_INVALID_SESSION]} and @perr{[MAP_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCE]}.

This Object-Identifier is represented by the constant @b{GSM-SM-Package} (@samp{MAP_GSM_SM_PKG}).

The XMAP API may also make use of Mobile Application Services packages.  These optional packages
define OM classes that are additional to those in the Mobile Applicatoin packages, to extend the
capabilities of the interface.

The concepts of OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation are briefly described in @ref{Relationship to Data
Abstraction Services}.  The notation is introduced below.  Both are fully explained in the XOM
Specification (see reference XOM).

Each OM class is described in a separate section, which identifies the OM attributes specific to
that OM class.  The OM classes are listed in alphabetic order; the OM attributes for each OM class
are listed in the order in which they occur in corresponding ASN.1 definitions.  The OM attributes
that may be found in an instance of an OM class are those OM attributes specific to that OM class
and those inherited from each of its superclasses.  The OM class-specific OM attributs are defined
in a table.  The table gives the name of each OM attribute, the syntax of each of its values, any
restrictions upon the length (in bits, octets (bytes), or characters) of each value, any
restrictions upon the number of values, and the value, if any, the @i{OM-Create()} function
supplies.

@subheading Vendor Extensions

Vendors may provide additional OM attributes in their implementation of particular OM classes and
their individual documentation will give details of the specification and usage of these.
Extensions must be negotiated through use of the @i{Negotiate()} function.

All such OM attributes have default values which lead to the behaviour described in this
specification.

This section depicts the hierarchical organizatino of the OM classes defined in this chapter, and
thus shows which OM classes inherit additional OM attributes from their superclasses.
Subclassification is indicated by indentation, and the names of abstract OM classes are rendered in
italics.  Thus, for example, the concrete class @b{Itut-SCCP-Address} is an immediate subclass of the
abstract class @i{Address} which in turn is an immediate subclass of the abstract class @i{Object}.
The @i{Create()} function applies to all concrete OM classes.

The application is not permitted to create or modify instances of some OM classes, because these OM
classes are only returned by the interface and never supplied to it (for example, some subclasses of
@i{Error}).

The Common MAP package introduces some additional OM syntaxes that are derivations of the
@i{String(Octet)} syntax.  These additional OM syntaxes are used to represent digit strings for
telephony numbers and SCCP addresses.

@node String(TBCD)
@subsection String(TBCD)

This OM syntax is indicated in OM Attribute tables as @i{String(TBCD)}.

In the C binding, the OM Syntax name for @i{String(TBCD)} is declared as @samp{MAP_S_TBCD_STRING}.

A TBCD string is a Telephony Binary Coded Decimal encoding where digits @samp{0} through @samp{9},
@samp{*}, @samp{#}, @samp{a}, @samp{b} and @samp{c} keys are coded @samp{0000} through @samp{1001},
@samp{1010}, @samp{1011}, @samp{1100}, @samp{1101} and @samp{1110}.  The @var{(2n)}'th digit is
encoded in the @var{n}'th octet in bits @samp{4321} and the @var{(2(n-1)+1)}'th digit iin bits
@samp{8765}.  Code @samp{1111} is used as a filler when the number of digits is odd.

A Telephony Binary Coded Decimal (TBCD) String is used to represent several digits from @samp{0}
through @samp{9}, @samp{*}, @samp{#}, @samp{a}, @samp{b}, @samp{c}, two digits per octet, each digit
encoded @samp{0000} to @samp{1001} (@samp{0} to @samp{9}), @samp{1010} (@samp{*}),
@samp{1011}(@samp{#}), @samp{1100} (@samp{a}), @samp{1101} (@samp{b}), @samp{1110} (@samp{c});
@samp{1111} used as a filler when there is an odd number of digits.   Bits @samp{8765} of octet
@var{n} encodes digit @var{2n}.  Bits @samp{4321} of octet @var{n} encoding digit @var{2(n-1)+1}.

@node String(Sccp-Address)
@subsection String(Sccp-Address)

This OM syntax is indicated in OM Attribute tables as @i{String(Sccp-Address)}.

In the C binding, the OM Syntax name for @i{String(Sccp-Address)} is declared as
@samp{MAP_S_SCCP_ADDRESS_STRING}.

An SCCP Address string is a encoded octet string where the encoding is the encoding of an SCCP
address in either ITU-T or ANSI format in accordance with the format specified for the SCCP Called
Party Address in ANSI T1.112/2000 Section 3.4 and ITU-T Recommendation Q.713 Section 3.4.  This
encoding is formatted as follows:

@table @asis
@item Octet 1
The first octet contains the address indicator, which is always present.  The bits of the address
indicator are interpreted as follows:
@table @asis
@item bit 8
@table @code
@item 0
A @samp{0} in bit 8 indicates that the address is formatted as an ITU-T address.
@item 1
A @samp{1} in bit 8 indicates that the address is formatted as an ANSI address.
@end table
@item bit 7
@table @code
@item 0
A @samp{0} in bit 7 indicates that SCCP translation is required and routing is based on global
title.
@item 1
A @samp{1} in bit 7 indicates that SCCP translation is not required and routing is based on
signalling point code and subsystem number.
@end table
@item bits 6543
These bits contain the global title indicator that determines the format of the Global Title.
@item bit 2
@table @code
@item 0
A @samp{0} in bit 2 indicates that the address does not contain a signalling point code.

@node Abort-Argument
@subsection Abort-Argument

An instance of OM abstract class @var{Abort-Argument} represents the base information passed as the
@i{Argument} argument to the @i{Abort()} function (@pxref{Abort}) or returned from the @i{Receive()}
function (@pxref{Receive}) in the @i{Receive-Result-Or-Argument} result for a user abort indication.

This OM class is an abstract class with several defined concrete subclasses: @b{GSM-Abort-Argument}
(@pxref{GSM-Abort-Argument}) and @b{ANSI-Abort-Argument}.

An instance of this OM class has the OM attributes of its superclasses, @i{Object}, @i{Error};
it does not define any attributes of its own.

Because abort causes are Mobile Application package specific, this abstract OM class does not define
any of the values for the @var{problem} or @var{parameter} attributes of the @i{Error} superclass.

See also @ref{Service Error}.

@c @tabfig{xmap_tab053,53,OM Attributes of OM class @var{Abort-Argument}}

@ignore
When a concrete subclass of this object is received as a @i{Receive-Result-Or-Argument} result in a
call to @i{Receive()} (@pxref{Receive}), the @i{Get-Assoc-Info()} function may be used to retrieve
additional details concerning the association.  @xref{Get-Assoc-Info}.

@vtable @var
@item requestor-Address
Indicates the address of the requesting program named by @b{requestor-Title}.  If both the
requestor-Address and requestor-Title are not specified, the service provider will supply a default
requestor-Address.
@item requestor-Title
Indicates the name of the requesting program, user of this session.  It may be a distinguished name
(instance of OM class @b{Form1}) or a registerd name (instance of OM class @b{Form2}) which is used
in name/network address resolution phase to get the application process title, the application
entity qualifier and the presentation address.  It my also be the entity-name of the requesting
program.
@item role
Indicates the roles acted by the resquestor.  The role value is specified by OR-ing none, one, or
more of the following values:
@table @asis
@item @b{performer-role} (@samp{MAP_T_PERFORMER_ROLE})
Responder and performer of mobile application services operations.  Unless this role is set or
implied, no indications will be returned by calls to @i{Receive} and the Mobile Application Service
provider does not need to provide indications to the bound session user.
@item @b{invoker-role} (@samp{MAP_T_INVOKER_ROLE})
Requester and Invoker of mobile application services operations.  If @b{performer-role} is set and
@b{invoker-role} is clear, the Mobile Application Service provider does not need to honor operation
or service requests from the bound session user.
@end table
When both role flags are clear, the Mobile Application Service provider may still honor operation
and service requests.
@item file-Descriptor
Indicates the file descriptor associated with the session.  The file descriptor may be used by
implementors of the @i{Wait()} function.  The file descriptor may be used in subsequent calls to
vendor-specific system facilities to suspend the process (for example, System V @manref{poll(2)} or
BSD @manref{select(2)}).  Its use for any other purpose is unspecified.

If the implementation does not define any suitable supsension facilities, or if the session is not
started, the value is @b{No-Valid-File-Descriptor} (@samp{-1} or
@samp{MAP_NO_VALID_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}).
@item presentation-Layer-Args
Indicates any presentation layer arguments needed during association establishment.  If none are
supplied, the Mobile Application Service provider will supply defaults if required.
@item acse-Args
Indicates the ACSE related arguments that will be used during association establishment.  If none
are supplied, the Mobile Application Service Provider will supply defaults if required.

The GSM MAP package provides specialization of the argument and result objects of the Common MAP
package to provide for the services under the GSM MAP as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 Section 7.6.
This package is organized as a separate OM package that can be negotiated using the @i{Negotiate()}
function.@footnote{@xref{Negotiate}.}

The Object-Identifier associated with the GSM MAP package is:
@smallformat
@verbatim
{ iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4) enterprises(1) openss7(29591)
  xom-packages(1) xmap(1) gsm(2) }
@end verbatim
@end smallformat
This Object-Identifier is represented by the constant @b{GSM-Package} (@samp{MAP_GSM_PKG}).  This
constant can be used to negotiate support for the package using the @i{Negotiate()} function.

GSM MAP package introduces some additional OM syntaxes that are derivations of the @i{String(Octet)}
syntax.  These additional OM syntaxes are used to represent digit strings and telphony numbers.
@xref{String(Address)}.

@node Errors
@chapter Errors

This chapter defines the errors that can arise in the use of the interface and described the methods
used to report them.  There are basically two types of errors:

@itemize
@item Mobile Application Protocol Standards Errors
@item API Function Call Errors
@end itemize

Mobile Application Protocol Standards Errors are defined within a mobile application protocol
specification such as ANSI-41D and 3GPP TS 29.002.  This type of error is referred to as a
Service-Error.  Service-Errors may be created by applications programs as arguments on response
function calls and appear as results on request function calls with a status of success
@perr{[MAP_SUCCESS]}.  Service-Errors also appear as results of @i{Receive()} with a status of
success @perr{[MAP_SUCCESS]}.  A Service-Error is a private object containing details of the problem
that occured and including other relative information.

Service-Errors are reported using two OM classes that subclasses of the OM class Error:

@itemize
@item @b{Service-Error} defined as part of the Common MAP Package as discussed in @ref{Common MAP
Package}.
@item @b{Service-Reject} defined as part of the Common MAP Package as discussed in @ref{Common MAP
Package}.
@end itemize

API function call errors are defined by this specification.  This type of error is referred to as a
@dfn{Function-Call-Error}, and it has sub-categories of @dfn{Communications-Error},
@dfn{Library-Error} and @dfn{System-Error}.

Function-Call-Errors are reported to the application program by means of a @b{Status} that is a
result of every function (it is the function result in the C language binding).  A function that
completes successfully returns the value @b{success} (@samp{((MP_status)0)} @perr{[MAP_SUCCESS]}),
while one that is not successful returns an error.  The error is an integer.  In a few cases,
additional function calls can be used to gain additional error information as discussed below.

The error constants @perr{[MAP_NO_WORKSPACE]}, @perr{[MAP_INVALID_SESSION]} and
@perr{[MAP_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES]} can be returned by all functions except @i{Error-Message()} and
@i{Initialize()}:

@itemize
@item @perr{[MAP_NO_WORKSPACE]}
should be returned if @i{Initialize()} is not invoked before calling any other function.
@item @perr{[MAP_INVALID_SESSION]}
should be returned if an invalid session object is passed into the function.
@item @perr{[MAP_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES]}
should be returned if the function is unable to complete due to resource problems, for example, lack
of memory.
@end itemize

The function call @i{Get-Last-Error()} may be used to report an additional integer value when the
error constant is @perr{[MAP_E_COMMUNICATIONS_PROBLEM]}, @perr{[MAP_E_BROKEN_SESSION]} or
@perr{[MAP_E_SYSTEM]}.

The function call @i{Validate-Object()} (@pxref{Validate-Object}) may be used to report an
additional private object containing details related to an error constant of
@perr{[MAP_E_BAD_ARGUMENT]}.

The situation is more complicated for asyncrhonous operations, because these can fail at two stages:
either before the remote operation is started, or during it.  The first type is reported immediately
in the status of the invoking function, while the second is returned as the @b{Operation-Status}
result of a later call to @i{Receive()} (@pxref{Receive}).

Errors are classified into several OM subclasses of the OM class @var{Error}.

This specification defines the subclasses @b{Service-Error} and @b{Service-Reject} in the Common MAP
package to represent errors of Common MAP service.

The Standards specify different kinds of service errors:

@itemize ---
@item MAP Service User Errors
@item MAP Service Provider Errors
@item TC User Errors
@item TC Provider Errors
@item NS Provider Errors
@end itemize

@itemize
@item MAP user service errors:
@item MAP provider service errors:
@table @b
@item duplicated-invoke-id
@item not-supported-service
@item mistyped-parameter
@item resource-limitation
@item initiating-release
@end table
@item TC provider service errors:
@item Network Service errors:
@end itemize

The OM classes defined in this chapter are part of the GSM MAP package introduced in @ref{GSM MAP
Package}.

To allow automatic association management and automatic dialog handling (that is, transparent
association and dialog establishment and release), the interface may not communicate with a program
when @i{Bind()} is called, but may defer it until a mobile application service operation is
requested.  Because of this flexibility, all functions can return the same errors as @i{Bind()}.
For example, a @i{Service-req()} operation may return a version incompatibility error because the
association was deferred until access was actually needed.

@node Communications-Error
@subsection Communications-Error

Communications errors report an error occuring in the underlying communications service supporting
the Mobile Application Services.  Communications errors include those arising from TCAP component
handling, dialogue handling, transaction handling, and network services part communications.  The
following error constants are considered @b{Communiections-Error} values:

@table @b
@item communications-problem
A communications problem with the peer entity involved in the current operation occurred.  No more
results will be returned for the outstanding operation.  This problem may be temporary.

If a synchronous call has returned a communications problem, additional information may be received
by issuing a @i{Receive()} on the related session.  For example, syncrhonous calls may fail because
a dialog  session has been aborted by the remote peer.  The abort indication would be received via
@i{Receive()}.

The OM attribute @var{parameter} may be present with additional information.
@item broken-session
A fatal access problem to the Mobile Application Service provider has occurred.  The invoked session
is abruptly terminated (no longer usable).  No more results will be returned for the outstanding
operation.  Further usage of this session would return the @dfn{Library-Error} @b{session-terminated}.

The OM attribute @var{parameter} may be present with additional information.
@end table

An additional integer value may be returned if the application issues the @i{Get-Last-Error()} call.
The value of the integer is MAS provider specific.  It is not possible to stanardize the values
since there is no standard for the MAS provider.  However, most MAS providers provide some error
value when a communications error occurs.

An applications program might use this to check whether the MAS provider has had a fatal error, some
temporary problem, or whether a request as made for something that this MAS provider does not
support.  Most MAS providers offer a range of error codes that define specific error conditions of
this nature.

@node Error
@subsection Error

The OM class @b{Error} comprises the parameters common to all errors.

It is an abstract OM class that has the OM attributes of its superclasses, @i{Object}, and
additionally the OM attributes listed in @tabref{67}.

@tabfig{xmap_tab067,67,OM Attributes of OM class @b{Error}}

Details of errors are returned in an instance of a subclass of this OM class.  Each subclass
represents a particular kind of error, and is one of:

@itemize
@item @b{Service-Error}
@item @b{Service-Reject}
@end itemize

The Om attributes of @var{Error} are:

@vtable @var 
@item problem
Give the details of the error.  A number of possible values are defined, but implementations may
define additional values.  Implementations will not return other values for error conditions
described in this chapter.  Each of the standard values is listed and is described under the
relative error OM class.
@item parameter
This OM attrribute supplies additional information accompanying the service rror notification.  Its
OM value syntax, denoted by @dfn{any}, that is allowed for this OM attribute is determined by the
paritcular value of the OM attribute value @var{problem}.

Some error notifications do not define additional information.  In this case, the OM attribute
@var{parameter} may be absent.
@end vtable

@node Library Error
@subsection Library Error

Library errors report an error detected by the interface function library.

Each function has several possible errors that can be detected by the library itself, and which are
returned directly by the subroutine.  These errors occur when the library itself is incapable of
performing an action, submitting a service request, or parsing a response from the system management
service.

The following error constants are considered Library-Error values that identify the particuar
library error that has occurred.  The @b{ERRORS} section of each function description lists just
those which that function can return.

The possible cause of the failure and their associated information are:

@table @b
@item bad-address (@code{MAP_E_BAD_ADDRESS})
An invalid address was supplied.
@item bad-argument (@code{MAP_E_BAD_ARGUMENT})
A bad argument was supplied.  The application program may use the @i{Validate-Object()} function
call to receive more detailed information.
@item bad-class (@code{MAP_E_BAD_CLASS})
The OM class of an argument or a result or a linked reply or an error is not supported for this
operation.
@item bad-context (@code{MAP_E_BAD_CONTEXT})
An invalid context argument was supplied.
@item bad-error (@code{MAP_E_BAD_ERROR})
A bad service-error-was supplied.
@item bad-linked-reply (@code{MAP_E_BAD_LINKED_REPLY})
A band linked-reply was supplied.
@item bad-procedural-user (@code{MAP_E_BAD_PROCEDURAL_USER})
The procedural use of linked-reply is not compliant with the standards, or the permitted service
primitive chaining is violated.
@item bad-result (@code{MAP_E_BAD_RESULT})
A bad result was supplied.
@item bad-session (@code{MAP_E_BAD_SESSION})
An invalid session was supplied.
@item bad-title (@code{MAP_E_BAD_TITLE})
An invalid title was supplied.
@item bad-workspace (@code{MAP_E_BAD_WORKSPACE})
An invalid workspace argument was supplied.
@item miscellaneous (@code{MAP_E_MISCELLANEOUS})
A miscellaneous error occured in interacting with the system management service.  This error will be
returned if the interface cannot clear a transient system error by retryning the affected system
call.
@item no-such-operation (@code{MAP_E_NO_SUCH_OPERATION})
The library has no knowledge of the designated operation or notification in progress or that the
response mismatches the invoked operation.
@item not-supported (@code{MAP_E_NOT_SUPPORTED})
An attempt was made to use optional functionality that is not available in this implementation or
that was not agreed for use on that session.
@item reply-limit-exceeded (@code{MAP_E_REPLY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED})
The maximum number of linked replies about which the requested service should return information is
reached.
@item session-terminated (@code{MAP_E_SESSION_TERMINATED})
The session is terminated and thus results of outstanding operations are no longer available.
@item time-limit-exceeded (@code{MAP_E_TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED})
The maximum elapsed time within which the requested service should be provided is reached.
@item too-many-operations (@code{MAP_E_TOO_MAY_OPERATIONS})
No more management operations can be performed until at least one asynchronous operation has
completed.
@item too-many-sessions (@code{MAP_E_TOO_MANY_SESSIONS})
No more mobile application sessions can be started.
@end table

@node Service Error
@subsection Service Error

The OM classes @b{Service-Error} and @b{Service-Reject} report management errors related tot
he provision of service.

This specification defines OM classes for reporting GSM service errors, each of which has the OM
attributes of its superclasses, @i{Object}, @i{Error}, and no other attributes.

@table @b
@item Service-Error
Corresponding errors of the MAP service.
@item Service-Reject
Corresponding errors of the TCAP service.
@end table

These OM classes are used to report errors in compliance with the respective standard.

@node System Error
@subsection System Error

System erorrs report an error occurring in the underlying operating system.

The error constant @perr{[MAP_E_SYSTEM_ERROR]} is the only value in this Function-Call-Error
cagtegory.  An additional integer value may be returned if the application issues the
@i{Get-Last-Error()} function call.  Its value is the same as that of @manref{errno(3)} defined in
the C language.  The standard names of system errors are defined in the X/Open Portability Guide
(see reference @b{XPG}), and additonal names maybe implementation-defined.

If a transient error occurs (@perr{[EINTR]} or @perr{[EAGAIN]}), implementations will retry the
affected operation and will not report these errors.  If such an error persists they may report the
Library error (miscellaneous) or an implementation-defined library error.
