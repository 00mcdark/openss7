Abstract

     The SS7 MTP2 User Peer-to-Peer Adaptation Layer (M2PA)  [M2PA09] is
  a protocol supporting the transport of Signalling System No. 7 (SS7)
  [Q.700] Message Transfer Part (MTP) Level 3 [Q.701] signalling
  messages over Internet Protocol (IP) using the services of the Stream
  Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC 2960].  This protocol would
  be used between SS7 Signalling Points using the MTP Level 3 protocol.
  The SS7 Signalling Points may also use standard SS7 links using the
  SS7 MTP Level 2 [Q.701] to provide transport of MTP Level 3 signalling
  messages.  The protocol operates in a manner similar to MTP Level 2 so
  as to provide peer-to-peer communication between SS7 endpoints.

     This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
  which describes the minimum amount of objects needed to manage the
  implementation of the M2PA.

1.  Introduction

     This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module that
  describes managed objects for the implementation of the M2PA.

1.1.  Scope

     The document starts with a brief summary description of the SNMP
  framework and continues with the MIB explanation and security
  considerations among others.

1.2.  Terminology

     This memo supplements the terminology used in SCTP [RFC 2960] and
  M2PA [M2PA09] by adding the following terms:

1.3.  Abbreviations

     This memo supplements the abbreviates used in SCTP [RFC 2960] and
  M2PA [M2PA09] by adding the following abbreviations:

  MIB -- Management Information Base

  SMI -- Structure of Management Information

  SNMP -- Simple Network Management Protocol

1.4.  Conventions

     The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
  SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they
  appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC
  2119 [RFC 2119].

1.5.  Overview

     The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
  components:

   + An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [RFC 2271].

   + Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management, Structure of Management Information (SMI)
     Version 1 [RFC 1155] and Structure of Management Information (SMI)
     Version 2 [RFC 1902..RFC 1904]

   + Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
     first version of SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 [RFC 1157].
     The second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an
     Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c [RFC 1901, RFC
     1906].  The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3
     [RFC 1906, RFC 2272, RFC 2574].

Internet-Draft                   M2UA AS               February 17, 2004

   + Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
     described in SNMPv1 [RFC 1157].  A second set of protocol
     operations and assocaited PDU formats is described in SNMPv2 [RFC
     1905].

   + A set of fundamental applications [RFC 2273] and view-based access
     control mechanism [RFC 2575].

     Managed objects are accessed from a virtual informaiton store,
  termed the Management Information Base (MIB).  Objects in the MIB are
  defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.  This memo specifies
  a MIB module that is compliant to SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the
  SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.  The
  resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where
  objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use
  of Counter64).  Some machine-readable information in SMIv2 will be
  converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
  process.  However, this loss of machine-readable information is not
  considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

1.5.1.  Structure of the MIB

     Also [Q.751.1, Q.752, T1.116.1, T1.116.2]

     For a detailed overview of the documents that describ the current
  Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
  RFC 3410 [RFC 3410].

     Managed objects are accessed from a virtual information store,
  termed the Management Information Base (MIB).  MIB objects are
  generally access through the Simple Network Management Protocol
  (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
  in the Structure and Identification of Management Information (SMI).
  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2 [RFC
  2578..RFC 2580].
