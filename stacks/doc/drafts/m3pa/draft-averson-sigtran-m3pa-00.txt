Abstract

      This Internet-Draft describes SS7 MTP3-User Peer-to-Peer
   Adaptation Layer Procedures (M3PA) to support peer-to-peer operation
   for SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer [M3UA] in support of MTP3 [EN 300
   008-1] users in an all IP network.  These procedures permit the
   seamless operation of SS7 MTP3-User in an all-IP environment, while
   not requiring (but allowing) interworking to the SS7 network.  This
   permits the implementation of all-IP solutions for SS7 signalling
   between MTP3-Users.

Internet Draft                    M3PA                 February 21, 2004

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Scope

      The Internet-Draft describes SS7 MTP3-User Peer-to-Peer Adaptation
   Layer (M3PA) procedures to support peer-to-peer SS7 MTP signalling
   between IP nodes in an IP network in extension to the messages and
   procedures provided for SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer [M3UA].  These
   extensions provide seamless operation of the MTP3-User interface [EN
   300 008-1] between M3UA endpoints (SGP and ASP) across an IP network.
   Interworking between M3PA endpoints supporting these procedures and
   SS7 SGs is also provided.

      In addition, this I-D describes extension messages and procedures
   which are required to permit M3PA endpoints to act as relay points to
   other M3PA nodes, providing the Signalling Transfer Point (STP) [EN
   300 008-1] capabilities contained within an IP network.

      M3UA implementations providing the M3PA extension procedures and
   messages are intended to be compatible with M3UA implementations not
   supporting these extensions; however, the full benefits acheived by
   M3PA procedures will not be realized unless implementations at both
   endpoints implement M3PA.

1.2.  Terminology

      M3PA supplements the terminology used in M3UA [M3UA] by adding the
   following terms:

   Changeover -

   Changeback -

   Controlled Rerouting -

   Forced Rerouting -

   Signalling Endpoint (SEP) - in this document, a Signalling Enpoint is
      an SS7 SEP [Q.700] or an Application Server.

   Signalling Peer Process (SPP) - refers to an ASP, SGP or IPSP.

   Time-controlled Changeover - the MTP3 [EN 300 008-1] procedure for
      diverting signalling traffic from a failed primary linkset to an
      alternate linkset where sequence number information cannot be
      exchanged between signalling points or where it is undesirable to
      use the normal changeover procedures.

1.3.  Overview

      The purpose of M3PA protocol is to increase inter-IP {Tolga: or
   intra-IP?} communication capabilities of M3UA peers and to allow SS7
   signalling backhauling between SS7 nodes over IP.

      In the configuration in Figure 1 SGs act as transfer points
   between ASP clouds. Their functionality is similar to the STP
   functionality in SS7 network. The communication between ASPs and SGs
   is as defined in M3UA.

      In the configuration in Figure 2 SGs act again as transfer points,
   but this time for SS7 nodes.

      M3PA management is based mainly on SSNM as defined in M3UA, with
   some additional messages to handle startup {Tolga: another term might
   be better}, changeover and congestion as defined in MTP3 [Q.704].

      Communication of peers using M3PA is on PC granularity.

2.  Conventions

      The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC 2119].

3.  Functional Areas

3.1.  Signalling Point Code Representation

      SGs should control SPMCs as a whole. When a SPMC becomes
   unavailable, SG will broadcast DUNA to all SGs, it has an association
   with. Similarly when a SPMC becomes available DAVA and when a SPMC
   becomes restricted DRST will be sent.

3.2.  Routing Context and Routing Keys

      Unlike M3UA, there is no Routing Context/Routing Key concept
   present in M3PA.

3.3.  Network Appearance

      NA is not used in M3PA. So, one SCTP association should carry
   traffic belonging to one specific network only and this should be
   coordinated among peers via configuration.

3.4.  SCTP Association Establishment

      There is no client/server relationship between peers in M3PA. SCTP
   associations might be initiated from any side.

      After a SCTP association is established, SGs will exchange SSNM to
   update the remote peer about the status of the PCs, which are by
   configuration declared as reachable via them. Unless a corresponding
   message is received, all PCs are assumed as accessible via the remote
   peer. Each SG will send DUNA for not available PCs and DRST for

   restricted PCs after the establishment of the association. The end of
   this unavailable/restricted PC announcement procedure is marked with
   a TAL(Traffic Allowed) {Tolga: This is the message corresponding to
   TRA} message. A SG should not start sending DATA to a peer, unless
   TAL is received.

4.  Protocol Elements

      The following subsections describe the parameters which are added
   by this extension, their format and the message in which they are
   used.

4.1.  Parameters

      M3PA supplements the following parameters:

4.1.1.  Concerned Destination

      M3PA supplements the Concerned Destination parameter of M3UA
   [M3UA] by allowing the parameter to be included in the DUPU message.
   When the Concerned Destination parameter is included in the DUPU
   message it is used to indicate the Signalling End Point (SEP) to
   which the indication of User Part Unavailability needs to be given.
   When included in the SCON message, the interpretation of the
   Concerned Destination parameter is as given in M3UA [M3UA].

   The Concerned Destination parameter is formatted as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     |   reserved    |               Concerned DPC                   |
     +---------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+


   The Concerned Destination parameter contains the following fields:

   Reserved: 8-bits
     Reserved bits are reserved for future use and MUST be coded all
     zeroes (0).

   Concerned DPC field: 24-bits
     The Concerned DPC field is a three-octet parameter to allow for
     14-, 16- and 24-bit binary formatted SS7 Point Codes.  A Concerned
     DPC that is less than 24-bits is padded to the left to the 24-bit
     boundary.

     The format of the 14-bit point code is as follows:

4.2.  Messages

      M3PA uses DATA and SSNM messages as defined in M3UA. RC and NA
   fields in messages are not used,i.e. they MUST not be filled.

4.2.1.  Destination User Part Unavailable (DUPU)

      M3PA supplements the DUPU message by permitting the following
   optional parameters the included in the message:

       Extension Parameters

   Concerned Destination: 32-bits

     The optional Concerned Destination parameter is used if the SCON
     message is sent from and IPSP with the relay capability.  The
     Concerned Destination parameter contains one Concerned Destination
     Point Code field, a three-octet parameter to allow for 14-, 16- and
     24-bit binary formatted SS7 Point Codes.  A Concerned Point Code
     that is less that 24-bits is padded to the left to the 24-bit
     boundary.

      A new field is introduced to DUPU.

      Concerned PC: Destination PC, which has caused DUPU to be
   generated. This parameter is mandatory.

      The format for DUPU message parameters is as follows:

  5.  Procedures

        M3PA provides for a set of procedures which are suited to peer-
     to-peer operation which are based on the procedures of M3UA [M3UA].
     M3PA provide supplementary use of the Concerned Destination
     parameter in the DUPU message, as well as providing additional
     procedures for M3UA [M3UA] messages.

  5.1.  Establishment of SCTP Associations

        An SCTP [RFC 2960] Association between two IPSPs is treated as
     equivalent to a "Signalling Route" as defined in the MTP
     specifications [1].  Therefore, an SCTP [RFC 2960] Association form
     a signalling relation between two ISPSs acting as Signalling
     Points.

        Whenever an SCTP [RFC 2960] Association is formed between two
     IPSPs, and the IPSPs have exchanged ASPUP and ASPUP Ack messages,
     the signalling relation is deemed to be available between the two
     IPSPs.  Whether messages can be transferred between the IPSPs is
     then determined by the exchange of SNMM messages between the
     IPSPs.[2]

  5.2.  Routing of Messages

        An IPSPs MAY be componsed of multiple SPPs.  There MAY be more
     than one SCTP Association between two IPSPs, but there MUST only
     one SCTP association between two SPPs.  Each IPSP MUST represent
     one or more SPMCs (Signalling Point Management Clusters) identified
     by a unique Signalling Point Code.

        For each DATA message which is sent by an IPSP, the sending IPSP
     selects the outgoing SCTP Association on the basis of the
     Destination Point Code (DPC) and the Signalling Link Selection
     (SLS) in the message.  The Destination Point Code (DPC) is used to
     identify the destination of the message and is used to select the
     next hop IPSP which has a route to the indicated destination or a
     final hop to the destination IPSP.  The Signalling Link Seletion
     (SLS) field in the DATA message is used to select one of multiple
     SCTP Associations that may exist between the sending IPSP and the
     next or final hop IPSP.

        The authors would like to thank <TBD> for their valuable
     comments and suggestions.

  Notes


     [1]  For a definition of "Signalling Route", see the pertinent MTP
          specifications, such as the ITU specifications [EN 300 008-1].


     [2]  NOTE:- In contrast to the procedures and messages of M3UA
          [M3UA] there is no need for IPSPs to exchange ASPTM or RKM
          messages.  These are backhaul messages and there is no need to
          use them for peer-to-peer operation.  IPSPs exchange SNMM
          messages to query or indicate the availability, congestion and
          restriction status of both adjacent and remote destinations.
