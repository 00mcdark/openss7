Abstract

      This Internet-Draft describes Load Selection for Signalling User
   Adaptation Protocols [M3UA, SUA09, TUA01], which permits an
   Application Server Processes (ASP) to indicate its placement within
   an Application Server and permits an Signalling Gateway (SG) to
   distribute traffic over ASPs in Application Servers under Application
   Server Process (ASP) control.

Internet Draft                 UA Multi-SG              January 10, 2002

1.1.  Scope

      This Internet-Draft provides parameters and procedures in
   extension to the parameters and procedures of the Signalling User
   Adaptation Layers (UAs) [M3UA, SUA09, TUA01], for the purpose of
   supporting Application Servers interworking with multiple Signalling
   Gateways to the SS7 Network.

      UA implementations with Multiple SG Support are intended to be
   compatible with UA implementations not supporting this configuration.

      MULTI-SG is only applicable to Signalling Gateway (SG)-Application
   Server Process (ASP) configurations in which ASP are supporting
   Application Server (AS) connectivity to an SS7 network via multiple
   SGs.<1> MULTI-SG is not applicable to configurations of IPSPs working
   in a point-to-point network without relay points.<2>

1.2.  Terminology

      Multiple SG Support (MULTI-SG) supplements the terminology used in
   the UA documents [M3UA, SUA09, TUA01] by adding the following terms:

   Multiple SG Support (MULTI-SG) - the parameters and procedures
      provided in this document.

   Signalling User Adaptation Layer (UA) - one or more of the Stream
      Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC 2960] SS7 Signalling
      User Adaptation Layers [M3UA, SUA09, TUA01] supporting the concept
      of a Routing Context.

1.3.  Overview

      MULTI-SG provides procedures in addition to the UA procedures<3>
   that provides for seamless interworking of SS7 Network Management
   with Application Server Processes (ASPs) supporting Application
   Servers (AS) to multiple Signalling Gateways (SGs).  MULTI-SG
   procedures provide support for the following functions not provided
   for in the existing UA documents:

    + Support for fail-over of SCTP associations between Signalling
      Gateways (SGs).
    + Support for rerouting of traffic destined to Signalling Endpoints
      (SEP) in SS7 Network between Signalling Gateways (SGs).
    + Support for seamless interworking with SS7 Changeback [Q.704]
      procedures towards the SS7 Network for rerouting of traffic
      between SGs for elminating message mis-sequencing across the

haul" case.
   <2>  This is commonly referred to within the SIGTRAN WG as the "peer-
to-peer" case.

      interworking point between the SS7 and IP networks.

      MUTLI-SG supplements the procedures for the diversion of traffic
   during fail-over or restoration of ASPs, SGPs and IPSPs already
   provided for in "Correlation Id and Heartbeat Procedures (CORID)
   Supporting Lossless Fail-Over between SCTP Associations" [CORID].
   The benefits of MULTI-SG can, nevertheless, be supported indepedent
   from CORID [CORID]

1.3.1.  Multiple SGs

      No procedures are described which provide for reduction of message
   loss, duplication or mis-sequencing in multiple SG configurations in
   the existing UA procedures.

1.3.1.1.  Fail-over of routesets between SGs

1.3.1.2.  Redirection of routesets between SGs

   Application Server Processes (ASPs) serving a number of Application
   Servers (ASs) are connected to two Signalling Gateways (SGs).  The
   SGs appear as mated SS7 Signalling Transfer Points (STPs) [Q.705] to
   the SS7 Network.  Traffic originating at Signalling Endpoints (SEP)
   in the SS7 network and directed toward SEP in the IP network (i.e.,
   Application Servers) is loadshared over the STPs by the Signalling
   Link Selection (SLS) [Q.704] value associated with each message.
   Traffic originating at the SEP in the IP network (i.e, AS) is
   loadshared over the SGs in the same fashion.

   SUA09, TUA01] for security considerations and recommendations that
   are applicable to each of these UAs.
