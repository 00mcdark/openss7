Abstract

     This memo describes Session Id Registration (SESSID) that provides
  the ability for one (listening) Application Server to indicate that a
  session should be established with another (accepting) Application
  Server for connection- and transaction-oriented messaging in the SS7
  Signalling User Adaptation Layers [M3UA...TUA01].  Extension
  parameters and procedures are added by this memo in extension to those
  of the User Adaptation layers to provide a closer model to that of the
  XNS/XTI interfaces, where one interface may be designated as a
  `listener' and another designated as an `acceptor'.  This permits ISO
  compliant interfaces for SCCP to maintain the same semantic for SUA
  and TUA.
