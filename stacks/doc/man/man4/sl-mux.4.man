.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B sl-mux
is a Signalling Link multiplexing driver.  The purpose of the driver is to
consolidate signalling link streams from a wide range of drivers and provide
common naming, addressing and management procedures for signalling links.
.PP
.B sl-mux
is used in conjunction with the Signalling Link configuration daemon,
.BR slconfd (8).
The configuration daemon is responsible for opening, configuring, and
attaching Signalling Link streams from a number of drivers and linking them
under the
.B sl-mux
multiplexing driver.  This makes signalling links from a number of drivers
available for use through the single
.B sl-mux
multiplexing driver.
The facilities provided by the
.B sl-mux
multiplexing driver are as follows:
.\"
.SS Addressing
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
provides a global addressing mechanism for addressing signalling links.  There
are two addressing mechanisms provided by the driver:
.TP
.B Global PPA
A Physical Point of Attachment addressing mechanism that is global to the
host.  Each signalling link stream is assigned a 32-bit PPA that is unique to
the host platform.  There is no restrictions on the internal form of the PPA,
merely that it be unique for each signalling link.  The
.BR slconf (5)
configuration file provides a mechanism whereby the system administrator can
assign arbitrary PPA addresses to signalling links from multiple drivers.
.TP
.B CLEI
A Common Language Equiment Identifier (ascii string) addressing mechanism that
is global across all platforms.  This is the Telcordia/Bellcore standard
mechanism for naming equipment.  The driver does not impose a restriction on
the CLEI string, only that the string be unique for each signalling link, and
that the string be no longer than 32 characters in length.
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver permits Style II signalling link streams to be opened and attached to
specific signalling links using either the PPA or CLEI as an address for
attachment.  See
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7).
.PP
Linking of signalling link streams beneath the multiplexing driver is
performed by the Signalling Link configuration daemon,
.BR slconfd (8).
The daemon opens the administrative minor device,
.IR /dev/sl-admin ,
and then opens signalling link streams on various drivers according to the
configuration specified in a configuration file,
.RB slconf (5),
attaches and configures the streams.  The daemon then links the SL streams
under the
.B sl-mux
driver using the
.IR I_PLINK (7)
input-output control.  It then uses the
.B SL_SETPPA
input-output control to associate a global PPA and CLEI with the linked
stream.  The daemon does this for each and every signalling link stream that
is to be linked under the driver.
.\"
.SS Monitoring
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver provides the ability to monitor the service interface to each or any
signalling link.  This is accomplished by opening a specialized minor device
number on the driver,
.IR /dev/sl-mon ,
and attaching it using the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive to a specific signalling link by global PPA or CLEI.  The stream
willi then deliver a copy of each and every primitive that is passed between
an upper SL-user and the monitored signalling link, regardless of whether the
primitive is an SL-user to SL-provider primitive, or an SL-provider to SL-user
primitive.
This provides the ability to monitor live signalling links that are in use by
other modules or drivers, such as the
.BR mtp (4),
Message Transfer Part driver, independent of the use of those drivers.
.PP
A monitoring stream will also process signalling link input-output controls on
the monitoring stream.  See
.BR sl_ioctl (4)
for a discussion of the available signalling link input-output controls.
.PP
Monitoring of signalling links is performed using the
.BR slmon (8)
utility.  The utility opens a
.I /dev/sl-mon
stream, and associates it with a specific signalling link using the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive.  Once attached, primitives that traverse the SL-user to SL-provider
interface are delivered to the stream.  The monitor disassociates with the
signalling link using the
.BR LMI_DETACH_REQ (7)
primitive, or by simply closing the stream.  The stream will also respond to
SL input-output controls,
.BR sli_ioctl (4),
from the monitoring stream.  The monitoring process must have root privilege
to open the
.I /dev/sl-mon
device.
.\"
.SS Configuration
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver provides the ability to perform configuration and administration of
signalling links.  This is accomplished by opening a specialized minor device
number of the driver,
.IR /dev/sl-admin .
Using modified
.BR sl_ioctl (4)
signalling link input-output controls, the adminstrative application can
configure and query the configuration for each and any (or all) signalling
links.  This interface is used by the the
.BR slconfd (8)
configuration utility to query and configure signalling links in accordance
with the signalling link management model presented in Q.751-1.

.\"
.SS Statistics
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver provides the ability to collect statistics (operational measurements)
for each and any signalling link.  This is accomplished by opening a
specialized minor device number on the driver,
.IR /dev/sl-stats .
Using modified
.BR sl_ioctl (4)
signalling link input-output controls, the administrative application can
collect statistics for each and any (or all) signalling links.  This interface
is used by the
.BR slstats (8)
utility to collect and record operational measurements for signalling links in
accordance with Q.751-1.

.]
.\"
.SS Events
.PP
The
.B sl-mux
driver provides the ability to collect event notifications (operational
measurements) for each and any signalling link.  This is accomplished by
opening a specialised minor device number on the driver,
.IR /dev/sl-events .
Using modified
.BR sl_ioctl (4)
signalling link input-output controls, the administrative application can
collect event notifications for each and any (or all) signalling links.  This
interface is used by the
.BR slstats (8)
utility to collect and record operational measurements for signalling links in
accordance with Q.751-1.
