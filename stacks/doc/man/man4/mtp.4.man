.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B MTP
is an implementation of the Signalling System No. 7
.RB ( SS7 (4))
Message Transfer Part
.RB ( MTP )
defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.704 and ANSI T1.111.4.
.B MTP
provides reliable sequenced or unsequenced delivery of packets over a
connectionless transport between two
.B MTP
endpoints.
.B MTP
provides strong assurances that the data arrives in order on a stream, if
requested, and maintains sequencing of packets in the face of most network
failures.  It generates and checks a per-packet checksum to catch transmission
errors.
.B MTP
routing routes around link and node failures in the
.BR SS7 (4)
network.
.PP
.B MTP
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR sl (4),
.BR m2ua (4)
or
.BR m2pa (4)
streams are linked under the
.B MTP
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide link services to
.BR MTP .
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR mtp_ioctl (4).
.PP
.B MTP
provides the following stream types:
.TP
.I /dev/mtp
This device provides the
.B MTP
protocol service interface using the M-primitives of the Message Transfer Part
Interface described in
.BR mtpi (7).
.TP
.IR /dev/mtp-npi-cl ", " /dev/mtp-npi-co
This device provides the
.B MTP
protocol service interface using the N-primitives of the Network Provider
Interface
.BR npi (7)
used for the Message Transfer Part as described in
.BR npi_mtp (7).
The
.BR npi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with the
.BR sockets (3)
library and provides the MTP interface using sockets as described in
.BR mtp_socket (7).
.I mtp-npi-cl
provides a connectionless
.B N_CLNS
network service provider;
.I mtp-npi-co
provides a pseudo-connection-oriented
.B N_CONS
network service provider.
.TP
.IR /dev/mtp-tpi-cl ", " /dev/mtp-tpi-co
This device provides the
.B MTP
protocol service interface using the T-primitives of the Transport Provider
Interface
.BR tpi (7)
used for the Message Transfer Part as described in
.BR tpi_mtp (7).
The
.BR tpi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with
the
.BR xnet (3)
or
.BR xti (3)
library and provides the MTP interface using XTI as described in
.BR xti_mtp (3).
.I mtp-tpi-cl
provides a connectionless
.B N_CLNS
transport service provider;
.I mtp-tpi-co
provides a pseudo-connection-oriented
.B N_CONS
transport service provider.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B MTP
provides two socket types used by the
.BR sockets (3)
library
.BR socket (3)
call.
.B MTP
provides sockets in the protocol family
.B PF_SS7
using the protocol number
.BR SS7PROTO_MTP .
The
.I socket_type
argument can be one of the following:
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B SOCK_RDM
Provides a connectionless datagram service with reliable delivery including
retransmission.  Message boundaries are preserved.  This socket uses the
underlying
.I /dev/mtp-tpi-cl
transport service provider.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET
Provides a pseudo-connection-oriented packet service with reliable delivery
including retransmission.  Message boundaries are preserved.  Messages can be
sent and received in order, if requested.  This socket uses the underlying
.I /dev/mtp-tpi-co
transport service provider.

.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interface support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2)
system calls on the
.IR mtp_stream ", " mtp_xtistr " or " mtp_socket .
These management controls are documented in
.BR mtp_ioctl (4).
