.TH MG 4 "$Date: 2004/01/17 07:59:23 $" "$Name:  $" "OpenSS7 Media Gateway Devices"
.SH NAME
.B mg
\- Media Gateway (MG)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <ss7/mgi.h>
.br
.B #include <ss7/mgi_ioctl.h>
.HP
.BI "int " mg_stream " = open(" device ", " flags );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B MG
is an implementation of a local switching matrix control for devices
conforming to the
.BR mxi (7)
and
.BR chi (7)
interfaces.
.B MG
provides for the control of the switch matrix.
.PP
.B MG
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR mx (4)
or
.BR ch (4)
streams are linked under the
.B MG
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (2),
to provide multiplex or channel services to
.BR MG .
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR mg_ioctl (4).
.PP
.B MG
provides the following stream types that are directly compatible with the
stream types provided by other
.BR MG (4)
drivers.  To select one fo these streams types, the
.I device
argument to the
.BR open (2)
call can be one of the following:
.TP
.I /dev/mg
This device provides the
.B MG
protocol service interface using the MG-primitives of the Media Gateway
Interface descrined in
.BR mgi (7),
as interpreted for use with local switching drivers as descibed in
.BR mgi_mg (7).
This interface is suitable both for use with other SS7 modules and drivers, as
well as with the
.BR cframe (3)
library using the
.B OpenSwitch
call framework.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
Unlike other OpenSS7 protocol modules and drivers providing transport
communications services,
.B MG
does not provide a
.BR sockets (3)
interface.  This is because the special needs of switch matrix control are
divorced from the sockets paradigm.
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2)
and
.I I_STR
commands to the
.BR streamio (2)
system calls on the
.I mg_stream
file descriptor.  These management controls are documented in
.BR mg_ioctl (4).

.SH VERSIONS
.PP
The
.B MG
interface is specific to the
.BR OpenSS7
MG stack.  This is Version 1 of the interface.
.PP
NGI interfaces are consistent with MGI Revision 0.8.2.
.PP
The
.B MG
driver does not appear until
.B strss7
release 0.8.4.
