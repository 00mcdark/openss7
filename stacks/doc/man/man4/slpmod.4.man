.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B slpmod
is a
.I STREAMS
module that is pushed over one end of a
.IR STREAMS -based
bidirectional
.BR pipe (4)
to form a pseudo-Signalling Link similar to
.I ITU-T Recomendation Q.703
.[
q703
.]
or
.IR "ANSI T1.111.3" .
.[
t1.111
.]
Both ends of the pipe with the
.B slpmod
module pushed, present the Signalling Link Interface (SLI),
.BR sli (7),
service interface and emulate either end of a signalling link.
.PP
.B slpmod
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
pushable module.
The module is pushed over one end of a
.BR pipe (4)
Stream using the
.I I_PUSH
command of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide the
.BR sli (7)
interface.
Once pushed, the module may be configured using
.BR sli_ioctl (4),
and provides a Stream providing the
.B SLI
protocol service interface using the SL-primitives of the Signalling Link
Interface described in
.BR sli (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The major purpose of the
.B slpmod
module is to transform a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
into a pseudo-signalling link that can be used use to connect virtual MTP signalling
points within the same host while retaining full signalling link service
interface and semantics.
.PP
To create one of these pseudo signalling links, a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
is opened using the
.BR pipe (2s)
command.  Then the
.B slpmod
module is pushed on one end (either end) of the pipe.  Once pushed, the pipe
then appears as a signalling link presenting the Signalling Link Interface
(SLI),
.BR sli (7),
service interface on either end of the pipe.
.PP
Each pipe end can then be linked under an
.BR mtp (4)
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK (7)
or
.IR I_PLINK (7)
.BR streamio (7)
commands.
The
.BR mtp (4)
driver will not be able to (not does it need to) distinguish between a real
SS7 signalling link between to two points and the pipe end with the
.B slpmod
module pushed.
.PP
The two major uses of the
.B slpmod
module are to create pseudo-signalling links for testing of the
.BR mtp (4)
multiplexing driver, and to provide a high-speed mechanism for interconnecting
virtual signaling points within a host.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
A pipe Stream with the
.B slpmod
module pushed supports a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2)
system calls on either Stream.
These management controls are documented in
.BR lmi_ioctl (4)
and
.BR sli_ioctl (4).

.SH VERSIONS

The SL interface is specific to the

SS7 stack.

supports Version 2 of the interface.
