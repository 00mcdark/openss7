.SH DESCRIPTION
.B SDT-PMOD
is an implementation of the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) Signalling Terminal
(SDT) as specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.702,
.[
q702
.]
but for STREAMS-based pipes instead of a syncrhonous communications channel.
.PP
.B SDT-PMOD
is implemented as a pushable
.IR STREAMS (4)
module.  The
.B SDT-PMOD
module can be pushed over a STREAMS-based
.BR pipe (4).
The
.B SDT-PMOD
module provides data terminal access to the byte stream from the STREAMS-based
pipe provided by the
.BR pipe (4)
stream below it.
The
.B SDT-PMOD
also provides AERM, SUERM and EIM functions directly.  The upper interface
provided by the
.B SDT-PMOD
module is the Signalling Data Terminal Interface (SDTI) as decribed in
.BR sdti (7).
.PP
.B SDT-PMOD
streams can have
.BR sl (4)
modules pushed to provide a complete SS7 Signalling Link that can then be
linked under an
.BR mtp (4)
or
.BR m2ua (4)
driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide signalling link services to the Level 3 protocol.  This is normally
performed, as required, by the SS7 Configuration Daemon,
.BR ss7confd (8).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B SDT-PMOD
has been implemented as a pushable module to ease the development of SS7
Signalling Link drivers for various cards.  All that is required is for the
pipe to provide a normal
.BR pipe (4)
interface and push the
.BR sdt-pmod
modules on one side of the pipe and
.BR sl (4)
modules on both sides of the pipe, to provide a complete and compliant SS7 Signalling Link.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B SDT-PMOD
is implemented internally as a wrapper around a STREAMS=based pipe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B SDT-PMOD
modules are not normally pushed or accessed directly by user-level programs.
The
.BR SDT-PMOD
module is used directly by some test and monitoring programs.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
The
.B SDT-PMOD
module responds to Local Management Interface (LMI),
.BR lmi_ioctl (4),
IO controls as interpreted for
.B SDT-PMOD
operation as described in
.BR sdti_ioctl (4).

.SH VERSIONS
.PP
The
.B SDT-PMOD
module conforms to the SDTI Specification, Revsion 0.8.2.
.PP
The
.B SDT-PMOD
module first appeared in
.B strss7
release 0.7.8.
.PP
In earlier releases of
.BR strss7 ,
the
.B SDT
module only provided AERM, SUERM and EIM functions over an
.B SDL
module that conformed roughly to the CDI sepcification (see
.BR cdi (7)).
Earlier release specifications and approaches are incompatible with the
current
.BR strss7
release 0.8.4 approach.  This only impacts driver development.
