.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ISDN
is an implementation of the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Layer 3
as defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.931.
.B ISDN
provides call control of telephone calls over the ISDN.
.B ISDN
uses the services of the Q.921 Data Link (see
.BR dl (4))
or ISDN Q.931 User Adaptation Layer (see
.BR iua (4))
to transfer packets.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B ISDN
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR dl "(4) or " iua (4)
streams are linked under the
.B ISDN
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide data link services to
.BR ISDN .
Once linked, the streams are configured using
.BR isdn_ioctl (4)
IO controls.  This function is normally performed by the ISDN Configuration
Daemon,
.BR isdnconfd (8).
See also,
.BR isdn (8).
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B ISDN
provides the stream types listed below.  To select a stream type, the
.I device
argument to the
.BR open (2)
call can be selected from the following:
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I /dev/isdn
This device provides the
.B ISDN
protocol service interface using the CC-primitives of the Call Control Interface (CCI) described in
.BR cci (7),
as interpreted for use with
.B ISDN
as described in
.BR cci_isdn (7).
This interface is suitable for use with other SS7 modules and drivers, as well
as with the
.BR cframe (3)
library using the
.B OpenSwitch
call framework.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Unlike other SS7 protocol modules and drivers providing transport services,
.B ISDN
does not provide a
.BR sockets (3)
interface.  This is because the special needs of call control are divorced
from the sockets paradigm.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
All interfaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2)
and
.I I_STR
commands to the
.BR streamio (7)
system calls on the
.I isdn_stream
file descriptor.  These management IO controls are documented in
.BR isdn_ioctl (4).

.SH VERSIONS
.PP
The

interface is specific to the
.BR OpenSS7
ISDN stack.  This is Version 2 of the interface.
