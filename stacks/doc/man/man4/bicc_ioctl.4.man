.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B BICC-IOCTL
si a definition of the managed object model for the
.BR bicc (4)
driver using the IO controls defined in
.BR lmi_ioctl (4).
The
.BR bicc (4)
driver is an implementation of the Bearer Independent Call Control (BICC)
protocol as defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.765 and ANSI T1.BICC.
.B BICC-IOCTL
provides the definition of the managed objects for the
.BR bicc (4)
driver in accordance with the managed object model for ISUP in ITU-T
Recommdnation Q.751.3.
.SS "Object Model"
.PP
.B BICC
provides for management of a number of managed objects.  These objects are of
a number of types as follows:
.TP
.B BICC_OBJ_TYPE_DF
Default Object.
.TP
.B BICC_OBJ_TYPE_CC
Call control user.
.TP
.B BICC_OBJ_TYPE_BC
Bearer circuit.
.TP
.B BICC_OBJ_TYPE_BG
Bearer group.
.TP
.B BICC_OBJ_TYPE_TG
Trunk group.
.TP
.B BICC_OBJ_TYPE_SR
Signalling relation.
.TP
.B BICC_OBJ_TYPE_SP
Signalling point.
.TP
.B BICC_OBJ_TYPE_MT
Message Transfer Part.
