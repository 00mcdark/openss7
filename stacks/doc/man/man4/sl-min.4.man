.SH NAME
.B sl-min
\- Signalling Link (SL) Mimimal Multiplexer
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include <ss7/sli.h>

.B #include <ss7/sli_ioctl.h>
.\"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B SL-MIN
is a minimal Signalling Link (SL) multiplexer.  Its purpose is to handle signalling link functions
that are normally performed at the MTP level so that a signalling link link can be used directly by
user level test programs without the need for an MTP.  The primary function of the multiplexer is as
follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
To hold the signalling link active between opens and closes of applications programs.  This is
accomplished by permanently linking a Signalling Link Stream beneath the multiplexing driver using
the
.BR I_PLINK (7)
STREAMS input-output control.
.IP \(bu
Maintain activity of the signalling link without user-level program intervention.  This is
accomplished by responding internally to SLTM request messages with SLTA messages.  Otherwise, the
remote MTP layer would not place the link into service and might take the link out of service after
a period of time.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B SL-MIN
multiplexing driver is not intended for use with more than one signalling link at a time.  Also, the
.B SL-MIN
multiplexing driver is only intended for performing Signalling Link interoperability testing with a
remote implemetnation containing a full MTP protocol layer: it is not intended for production use.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B SL-MIN
is implemented as a very simple STREAMS multiplexing driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To user the multiplexer, the application opens the device, opens the Signalling Link stream that is
to be kept available, and the Signalling Link stream is linked beneath the driver using the
.BR I_PLINK (7)
STREAMS input-output control.  A sample program that does this is the
.BR src/test/sl/test-sl-start.c
program in the distribution directory.
A sample program that stops the link is in the
.BR src/test/sl/test-sl-stop.c
program in the distribution directory.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
.B SL-MIN
does not accept any input-output controls of its own but passes all input-output controls to the
driver.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.B SL-MIN
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
SS7 application programming interfaces have not been subject to
standardization; however, where the OSI APIs are direclty
applicable to protocol layers of the SS7 stacks, OpenSS7
provides OSI compatible interfaces.  Thus,
.B MTP-MOD
is largely compatible with implements providing the CDI
interface.

.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
SS7 does not have a traditional and standard implementation;
however, the implementation standards from the OSI are in many
cases directly applicable.
Test programs and drivers such as
.B SL-MIN
are not standardized and have no comparable OSI interface.
.\"
.\"
.SH VERSIONS
.PP
The SL Interface (SLI) is specific to the
.B OpenSS7 
SS7 Stack.
This is Version 2 of the interface.
The
.B SL-MIN
module conforms to the SLI Specifiction, Revision 0.8.2.
