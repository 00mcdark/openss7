.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B slmon
is a monitoring utility for the SL-MUX multiplexing driver,
.BR sl-mux (4).
Its purpose is to provide the ability to monitor any signalling link interface configured in the
host.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
.BR -p ", " --ppa " " \fIPPA\fP
Specifies the Physical Point of Appearance,
.IR PPA ,
associated with the signalling link to be monitored.  The Physical Point of Appearance is a
representation of the 32-bit number specifying the global PPA.  See
.BR slconf (5)
for more information on global PPA addressing.
.TP
.BR -c ", " --clei " " \fICLEI\fP
Specifies the Common Language Equipment Identifier,
.IR CLEI ,
associated with the signalling link to be monitored.  The Common Language Equipment Identifier
is an ASCII string representation specifying the CLEI.  See
.BR slconf (5)
for more information on CLEI addressing.
.PP
One of the
.B -p
or
.B -c
options must be specified.  Otherwise,
.B slmon
will print usage information and exit with an error return value.
.TP
.BR -f ", " --file " " \fIFILENAME\fP
Specifies a file,
.IR FILENAME ,
to which the formatted monitoring information is to be written, instead of to standard output,
.IR stdout .
When a file name is specified with this option,
.B slmon
will close
.IR stdin ", " stdout " and " stderr ,
and place itself in the background as a deamon process.
.TP
.BR -h ", " --help
When this option is encountered, print usage information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
.BR -V ", " --version
When this option is encountered, print version information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
.BR -C ", " --copying
When this option is encountered, print copyright and copying information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.\"
.\"
.SH "OUTPUT FORMAT"
.PP
When
.B slmon
starts monitoring a signalling link, or reopens its output file, it outputs an informative header
that provides information about the signalling link being monitored and its configuration.
See
.RI \(lq EXAMPLES ,\(rq
below for an example of the informative header format.
.PP
This informative header is followed by a number of output lines.  Each output line corresponds to a
single service primitive that has traversed the SL service interface.  Each service primitive output
line starts with a common header that contains the following fields:
.TP
.RI < sequence >
A sequence number.  Each service primitive that passes the SL service interface is given a
monitonically increasing sequence number beginning with the number 1.  A missing sequence number
indicates that there was insufficient resources available to capture the service primitive
corresponding to the missing numbers.
.TP
.RI < timestamp >
A timestamp indicating the system clock time at which the service primitive was captured.
.TP
.RI < primitive >
The name of the service primitive that passed the interface.  This is one of the service primitives
defined for the Local Management Interface,
.BR lmi (7),
or Signalling Link Interface,
.BR sli (7),
by name.
.PP
The remaining fields provide the parameters of the service primitive and any user data associated
with the service primitive as a hexadecimal octet string.  Parameters are output with the parameter
name, followed by an equal sign,
.RI ` = ',
with no intervening whitespace, and the value of the parameter as a number or hexadecimal octet
string.
See
.RI \(lq EXAMPLES ,\(rq
below for an example of the service primitive output format.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.B slmon
is invoked from the command line or a shell script to monitor signalling links.  The signalling link
to monitor is specified using the
.BR -p " or " -c
options.  The
.B -p
option is used to specify the signalling link to monitor using the global PPA for the signalling
link.  The
.B -c
option is used to specify the signalling link to monitor using the Common Language Equipment
Identifier for the signalling link.
.PP
Once invoked,
.B slmon
begin printing formatted entries corresponding to SL service interface primitives to standard
output,
.IR stdout ,
if the
.B -f
option is not specified, or to
.I FILENAME
if the
.B -f
option is specified.  When the
.B -f
option is specified,
.B slmon
also places itself in the background and closes standard input, output and error streams.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B slmon
is implemented to use the
.I /dev/sl-mon
minor device provided by the
.BR sl-mux (4)
multiplexing driver.
.B slmon
opens a
.I /dev/sl-mon
stream and attaches the stream to a specific signalling link using the
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive and the global PPA or CLEI of the desired signalling link.  Once attached,
.B slmon
collects copies of service interface primitives that are delivered to the stream.  Each primitive is
formatted and printed either to standard output,
.IR stdout ,
or to a collection file specified with the
.B --file
option.
.\"
.\"
.SH SIGNALS
.PP
When operating as a daemon process, the
.BR slmon
utility accepts a number of signals as follows:
.TP
.RI { SIGHUP }
This signal causes the
.B slmon
utility in daemon mode to close and reopen the output file
.IR FILENAME .
This signal is used to rotate trace files.  The output file is first moved by another process, such
as the log rotation utility, to another file name and then the
.RI { SIGHUP }
signal is sent to the daemon causing it to close the rotated file name an open a new file of name
.I FILENAME
to continue logging.
.TP
.RI { SIGUSR }
This signal causes the
.B slmon
utility in daemon mode to reread configuration information for the signalling link using
input-output controls and output the result to the log file.
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1) indicates that an
error occurred and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message is printed on
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
option suppresses printing of diagnostic messages to
.BR stderr .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B slmon
has an impact on system performance, particularly when used to monitor signalling links that are
carrying a high amount of traffic.  The
.BR sl-mux (4)
driver places a sequence number on each service primitive delivered to the
.B slmon
application.  When the system is congested and the
.B slmon
is unable to keep up with the number of service primitives delivered to it, messages will be
dropped.  Dropped messages can be detected by the occurence of gaps in the sequence numbers
associated with the primitives.  The most likely service primitives to be dropped are
.BR SL_PDU_IND (7)
or
.BR SL_PDU_REQ (7)
primitives.
.PP
.B slmon
only monitors the Signalling Link service interface and the service primitives that traverse the
interface.  It does not monitor state machine transitions, or timer events.  Tracing of state
machine transitions and timer events is performed on a driver-by-driver basis.
For tracing of state
machin transitions and timer events, see the
.BR strace (8)
.IR STREAMS (9)
utility and the particular driver's manual page.
