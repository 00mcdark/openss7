.SH "ADDRESS FORMAT"
.PP
The MTP address format is structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct sockaddr_mtp {
    sa_family_t mtp_family;     /* Address family */
    uint16_t mtp_ni;            /* Network indicator */
    uint16_t mtp_si;            /* Service indicator */
    uint32_t mtp_pc;            /* Point code */
    uint8_t mtp_zero[sizeof(struct sockaddr) -
                     sizeof(sa_family_t) -
                     sizeof(uint16_t) * 2 - sizeof(uint32_t)];
} t_mtp_addr_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
The MTP address format is a
.B t_mtp_addr_t
structure containing the following members:
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I mtp_family
This field is for compatability with the
.BR sockets (3)
library and is not used by XTI/TLI and is ignored by the MTP provider.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I mtp_ni
conveys the Network Indicator.  The Network Indicator is an implementation
specific indication of the numbering space in which the
.I mtp_pc
is relevant.  Network Indicators are assigned by the system adminstrator.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I mtp_pc
conveys the MTP Signalling Point Code.  The format of the signalling point
code is network dependent.  Signalling Point Codes are least significant bit
aligned in a 32-bit long word.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I mtp_si
conveys the MTP Service Indicator.  The specific numbering of service
indicators is implementation and protocol variant specific.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I mtp_zero
This field is for comaptability with the
.BR sockets (3)
library and is not used by XTI/TLI and is ignored by the MTP provider.
.\"
.\"
.PP
The combination of
.IR mtp_ni ", " mtp_pc " and " mtp_si
define the MTP Service Access Point (MTP-SAP).
.\"
.\"
.PP
The network indicator can be \*(lqwildcarded\*(rq by setting
.I mtp_ni
to -1.
The signalling point code can be \*(lqwildcarded\*(rq by setting
.I mtp_pc
to -1.
.\"

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options are formatted according to the
.B t_opthdr
structure as described in
.BR xti (3).
An MTP transport provider compliant to this specification supports none, all
or any subset of the options defined here.  An implementation may restrict the
use of any of these options by offering them only in the privileged or
read-only mode.  M3UA
.RB ( m3ua (4))
and TALI
.RB ( tali (4))
transport providers only support a subset of
the options defined here.
.\"
.\"
.PP
An MTP conforming transport provider supports two levels of options.  These
two levels are described below.

Options within this level are specific to Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) and
are common to the all protocol levels in SS7.  For more information see
.BR xti_ss7 (3).
.\"

XTI/TLI call will fail, return -1, and set

.SS \fB\)t_bind\fR(3)
.PP
For MTP conforming transport providers, the
.I req->addr
field contains an MTP-SAP address as described above under
.IR "\*(lqADDRESS FORMAT\*(rq" .
If either the
.I mtp_ni
or
.I mtp_pc
components of the address are \*(lqwildcarded\*(rq, the MTP conforming
transport provider may assign a value to the \*(lqwildcarded\*(rq fields.  If
the MTP conforming transport provider completes a \*(lqwildcarded\*(rq field,
it must return the resulting bound address in the
.I ret->addr
parameter.
.\"
.\"
.PP
MTP supports a connectionless and pseudo connection oriented mode.  To bind a
connectionless stream,
.I req->qlen
should be set to zero (0).
To bind a pseudo connection oriented stream,
.I req->qlen
should be set to a non-zero positive integer.
Because MTP does not support connection indications,
on return from
.BR t_bind (3),
MTP conforming transport providers will return a
.I ret->qlen
of zero (0) regardless of the setting of
.IR req->qlen .

For pseudo-connection oriented service providers, this XTI/TLI call associates the
local MTP endpoint with a remote MTP endpoint to form a signalling relation.

only.

For connectionless service providers, this XTI/TLI call sends a unit data to the
MTP peer with the specified options, described under
.I \*(lqOPTIONS\*(rq
above.
For pseudo-connection oriented services providers, these XTI/TLI calls will fail,
return -1 and set
.IR t_errno (3)
to
