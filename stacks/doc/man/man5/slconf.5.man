.SH NAME
.B slconf
\- Signalling Link Configuration
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B /etc/slconf
.PP
.B #include <sys/slconf.h>
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The signaling link configuration database file,
.BR /etc/slconf ,
is a system file that contains configuration information for signalling links and, specifically, the
Signalling Link configuration daemon,
.BR slconfd (8).
.PP
Each entry in the signalling link configuration database file can be represented by a
.B slconfig
structure, formatted as follows:
.\"
.\"
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
Entries consist of a number of fields separated by newlines.  Fields are separated by whitespace and
occur in the order in which they are described below.  Whitespace can be embedded as blanks or
tabs.  Backslashes may be embedded as backslashes.  Lines that begin with an octothorpe,
.RI ` # ',
in column 1 are treated as comments.  Each valid line in the file describes an available signalling
link its associated configuration information.  Each entry contains the following fields:
.PP
\fBsl\fP <\fIclei\fP> <\fIglobal-ppa\fP> <\fIdevice-type\fP> \fI...\fP
.PP
Where,
.TP
.I clei
A Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) for the signalling link.  This CLEI can be used by
streams opening the
.BR sl-mux (4)
driver to attach to this signalling link.
.TP
.I global-ppa
A global Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) for the signalling link.  This PPA can be used by
streams opening the
.BR sl-mux (4)
driver to attach to this signalling link.
.TP
.I device-type
The device type defines the type of device that a is providing the signalling link.  The device type
can, for example, be one of:
.BR x400p ", " m2ua " or " m2pa .
For additional information on X400P-SS7 configuration, see
.BR x400pconf (5).
For additional information on M2PA configuration, see
.BR m2paconf (5).
For additional information on M2UA configuration, see
.BR m2uaconf (5).
.TP
.I ...
The remaining fileds are interpreted depending on the device type.  The signalling link
configuration daemon,
.BR slconfd (8),
that reads this file will attempt to open the shared object object derived from the name of the
device type.  The
.BR slconfd (8)
program will attempt to open the shared object named
\(lq\fB/usr/lib/ss7/\fIdevice-type\fB.so\fR\(rq,
where
.I device-type
is the name of the device type from the
.I device-type
field.
For example, for the
.B x400p
device type, the
.BR slconfd (8)
program will attempt to open
.RB \(lq /usr/lib/ss7/x400p.so \(rq.
.IP ""
The shared object opened by
.BR slconfd (8)
provides access procedures for the daemon to open, attach and configure the signalling link.  The
access procedures are passed the remainder of the configuration file entry and is parsed according
to the specific device type.
