.SH SYNOPSIS

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manpage is under construction.
.\"
.\"
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
.PP
Entries consist of a number of fields spearated by newlines.  Fields are separated by whitespace and
occur in the order in which they are described below.  Whitespace can be embedded as blanks or tabs.
Backslashes may be embedded as backslashes.  Lines that begin with an octothorpe,
.RI ` # ',
in column 1 are treated as comment lines.  Each valid line in the file describes either a signalling
data terminal profile or a signalling data terminal, depending upon the initial field value.
.PP
As an option for specifying field values out of order, or skipping field values, the name of the
field can be prefixed to the field entry with a equal sign,
.RB ` = '.
For example, the value for field
.B Te
can be written as:
.RB \(lq Te=\fIvalue\fP \(rq.
.PP
Each entry contains the following fields:
.PP
.B profile
.RI < name >
.RI < t8 >
.RI < Tin >
.RI < Tie >
.RI < T >
.RI < D >
.RI < Te >
.RI < De >
.RI < Ue >
.RI < N >
.RI < m >
.RI < b >
.RI < f >
.PP
Where,
.TP
.B profile
is a selector that indicates that this is a signalling data terminal profile entry.
.TP
.I name
is an identifier string used to identify this profile.
.TP
.I t8
is the EIM T8 timer duration (in milliseconds)
or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value or that the value is not applicable.
This value is only applicable to signalling links that utilize the EIM (Errored Interval Monitor).
.TP
.I Tin
is the AERM normal proving threshold (in number of SUs)
or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value or that the value is not applicable.
This value is only applicable to signalling links that utilize the AERM (Alignment Error Rate Monitor).
.TP
.I Tie
is the AERM emergency proving threshold (in number of SUs)
or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value or that the value is not applicable.
This value is only applicable to signalling links that utilize the AERM (Alignment Error Rate Monitor).
.TP
.I T
is the SUERM error threshold (in number of SUs)
or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value or that the value is not applicable.
This value is only applicable to signalling links that utilize the SUERM (Signal Unit Error Rate Monitor).
.TP
.I D
is the SUERM error rate parameter (in number of SUs)
or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value or that the value is not applicable.
This value is only applicable to signalling links that utilize the SUERM (Signal Unit Error Rate Monitor).
.TP
.I Te
is the EIM error threshold (in intervals)
or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value or that the value is not applicable.
This value is only applicable to signalling links that utilize the EIM (Errored Interval Monitor).
.TP
.I De
is the EIM correct decrement (in intervals)
or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value or that the value is not applicable.
This value is only applicable to signalling links that utilize the EIM (Errored Interval Monitor).
.TP
.I Ue
is the EIM error increment (in intervals)
or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value or that the value is not applicable.
This value is only applicable to signalling links that utilize the EIM (Errored Interval Monitor).
.TP
.I N
is the number of octets per SU in octet-counting mode or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value.
The default value is normally
.B 16
octets.  Octet counting mode is not applicable to all signalling terminals.
.TP
.I m
is the maximum SIF size or a single dash (or missing field) indicating the default value.  The default value is
dependent upon the interface rate and protocol options, but is normally
.B 272
octets.
.TP
.I b
is the transmit block size.
.TP
.I f
if the number of flags to be transmitted between frames.  It can have one of the following values:
.sp
.RS
.TP
.B one
one flag is transmitted between frames.
.PD 0
.TP
.B shared
a shared flag is transmitted between frames.
.TP
.B two
two flags are transmitted between frames.
.TP
.B three
three flags are transmitted between frames.
.TP
.I n
.I n
flags are transmitted between frames.
.TP
.B -
the default value is to be used, or the value is not applicable.
.PD
.PP
The number of flags is only applicable to signalling links that use SS7-HDLC (DAED) for framing
SDUs.  For example, ATM links and M2PA links do not frame SDUs with flags.
.RE
.PP
.B sdt
.RI < clei >
.RI < global-ppa >
.RI < sdti >
.RI < profile >
.RI < device-type >
.I ...
.PP
Where,
.TP
.B sdt
is a selector that indicates that this is a signalling data terminal entry.
.TP
.I clei
is a Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) for the signalling data terminal.  This value can be
used to open the signalling data terminal using the
.BR sl-mux (4)
driver.
.TP
.I global-ppa
is a global Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) for the signalling data termina.  This valud can be used
to open the signalling data terminal using the
.BR sl-mux (4)
driver.
.TP
.I sdti
is a Signalling Data Terminal Identifier (SDTI) for the signalling data termina.  This is interpreted as a
16-bit integer number used to identify the signalling data terminal to remote peers.
.TP
.I profile
is a profile name defined previously a
.B profile
entry with a
.I name
field corresponding to the value of this field.  It describes the configuration data for the
signalling data terminal.
.TP
.I device-type
is a device type.  This device type describes a shared object that can be opened by the
configuration program to interpret the remaining fields in the entry and perform configuration
actions with regard to the signalling data terminal.
.TP
.I ...
are additional configuration fields specific to the device type specified in the
.I device-type
field.
