.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The format of this message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_progress_req {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_PROGRESS_REQ */
    ulong cc_call_ref;          /* call reference */
    ulong cc_event;             /* progress event */
    ulong cc_flags;             /* progress flags */
    ulong cc_opt_length;        /* optional parameter length */

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests that the CCS provider indicate to the calling CCS user
that the call is progressing towards the called CCS user, with the specified
event.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_PROGRESS_REQ .
.TP
.I cc_call_ref
Specifies the call reference.  The call reference is used by the CCS provider
to identify the call.
.TP
.I cc_event
Specifies the progress event.  Progress events are protocol specific (see
Addendum).
.TP
.I cc_flags
Indicates progress flags. Progress flags are protocol specific (see Addendum).
.TP
.I cc_opt_length
Indicates the length of the optional parameters associated with the progress
request.  If no optional parameters are associated with the progress request,
then this parameter must be coded zero.
.TP
.I cc_opt_offset
Indicates the offset of the optional parameters from the start of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.\"
.\"
.\" .SS Rules

primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The applicable non-fatal errors are defined as follows:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.RB [ CCSYSERR ]
A system error occurred and the UNIX system error is indicated in the
.BR CC_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.TP
.RB [ CCOUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADCLR ]
The call reference specified in the primitive was incorrect or illegal.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADFLAG ]
The specified flags contained incorrect or unsupported information.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADOPT ]
The optional parameters were in an incorrect format, or contained illegal
information.
.TP
.RB [ CCACCESS ]
The user did not have proper permissions for the use of the requested address
or options.
.TP
.RB [ CCBADPRIM ]
