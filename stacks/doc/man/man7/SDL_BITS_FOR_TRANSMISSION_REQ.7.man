.SH NAME
.B SDL_BITS_FOR_TRANSMISSION_REQ, sdl_bits_for_transmission_req_t
\- bits for transmission request primitive
\"
\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The transmission request service primitive consists of one optional
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block followed by one or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks containing the bits for transmission.  The
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sdl_long sdl_primitive;
} sdl_bits_for_transmission_req_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This SDLS user originated primitive allows the SDLS user to specify bits for
transmission on the medium.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The transmission request service primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I sdl_primitive
Specifies the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SDL_BITS_FOR_TRANSMISSION_REQ .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only valid in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The state remains unchanged.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
