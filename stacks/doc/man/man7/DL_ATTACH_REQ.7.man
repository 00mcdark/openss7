.TH DL_ATTACH_REQ 7 "$Date: 2004/05/12 10:14:56 $" "$Name:  $" "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)"
.SH NAME
.B DL_ATTACH_REQ (dl_attach_req_t)
\- requests the DLS provider associate a physical point of
attachment (PPA) with astream.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one M_PROTO message block, which contains the
following structure.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_ppa;
} dl_attach_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_ATTACH_REQ
is needed for style 2 DLS providers to identify the physical
medium over which communication will transpire.  The request may not be
issued to a style 1 DLS provider; doing so may cause errors.
.PP
The DLS provider may initialize the physical line on receipt of this
primitive or the
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7).
Otherwise, the line must be initialized
through some management mechanism before this request is issued by the DLS
user.  Either way, the physical link must be initialized and ready for use
on successful completion of the
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7).
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 16
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_ppa
conveys the identifier of the physical point of attachment to be associated
with the stream.  The format of the identifier is provider-specific, and it
must contain sufficient information to distinguish the desired PPA from
all possible PPAs on a system.  At a minimum, this must include
identification of the physical medium over which communication will
transpire.  For media that multiplex multiple channels over a single physical
medium, this identifier should also specify a specific channel to be used
for communication (where each channel on a physical medium is associated with
a separate PPA).

Because of the provider-specific nature of this value, DLS user software that
is to be protocol independent should avoid hard-coding the PPA
identifier.  The DLS user should retrieve the necessary PPA identifier from
some other entity (such as a management entity) and insert it without
inspection into the
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ .
.SH STATE
The message is valid in state
.B DL_UNATTACHED .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.B DL_ATTACH_PENDING .
.SH RESPONSE
If the attach request is successful,
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS user
resulting in state
.BR DL_UNBOUND .
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting state is unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 16
.B DL_ACCESS
The DLS user did not have proper permission to use the requested PPA.
.TP
.B DL_BADPPA
The specified PPA is invalid.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in
the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).

The Data Link Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
