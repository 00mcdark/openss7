.TH DL_DISCONNECT_IND 7 "$Date: 2004/05/12 10:14:57 $" "$Name:  $" "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)"
.SH NAME
.B DL_DISCONNECT_IND (dl_disconnect_ind_t)
\- informs the DLS user that the data link connection on this stream has
been disconnected, or that apending connection (either
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ (7)
or
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7))
has been aborted.  The primitive indicates the origin and the cause of the
disconnect.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block containing the structure shown below.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_originator;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_reason;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_correlation;
} dl_disconnect_ind_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_IND .
.TP
.I dl_originator
conveys whether the disconnect was DLS user or DLS provider originated
.RB ( DL_USER
or
.BR DL_PROVIDER ,
respectively).
.TP
.I dl_reason
conveys the reason for the disconnect:
.RS
.TP
.B DL_DISC_PERMANENT_CONDITION
connection released due to permanent condition
.TP
.B DL_DISC_TRANSIENT_CONDITION
connection released due to transient condition
.TP
.B DL_CONREJ_DEST_UNKNOWN
unknown destination for connect request
.TP
.B DL_CONREJ_DEST_UNREACH_PERMANENT
could not reach destination for connect request - permanent condition
.TP
.B DL_CONREJ_DEST_UNREACH_TRANSIENT
could not reach destination for connect request - transient condition
.TP
.B DL_CONREJ_QOS_UNAVAIL_PERMANENT
requested quality of service parameters permanently unavailable during
connection establishment
.TP
.B DL_CONREJ_QOS_UNAVAIL_TRANSIENT
requested quality of service parameters temporarily unavailable during
connection establishment
.TP
.B DL_DISC_UNSPECIFIED
reason unspecified
.RE
.TP
.I dl_correlation
if non-zero, conveys the correlation number that was contained in the
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
that is being aborted (see
.I \*(lqMulti-threaded Connection Establishment,\*(rq
.BR dlpi (7)).
This value permits the DLS user to associate the message with the proper
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7).
If the disconnect indication is indicating the release of a connection that is
already established, or is indicating the rejection of a previously sent
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ (7),
the value of
.I dl_correlation
will be zero.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in any of the states:
.BR DL_DATAXFER ,
.BR DL_INCON_PENDING ,
.BR DL_OUTCON_PENDING ,
.BR DL_PROV_RESET_PENDING ,
.BR DL_USER_RESET_PENDING .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.BR DL_IDLE .
