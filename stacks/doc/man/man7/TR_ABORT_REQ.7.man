.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_ABORT_REQ
non-fatal \- Abort Request
.
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block followed by one or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks if there is any user data specified by the transaction user.
The format of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TR_abort_req {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_ABORT_REQ */
    ulong TRANS_id;           /* Transaction id */
    ulong ABORT_cause;        /* Cause of the abort */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* Options structure length */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* Options structure offset */
} TR_abort_req_t;
\fR\s+1

.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests that the transaction provider deny a request for association, or abort an
existing association.
.
.
.SS Parameters
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
Specifies the primitive type: always
.BR TR_ABORT_REQ .
.
.TP
.I TRANS_id
Specifies the transaction identifier previously indicated by the transport provider to uniquely
identify the association.
The transaction identifier must be the same as the transaction identifier that was indicated by the
transaction provider in the corresponding
.BR TR_BEGIN_IND (7)
or
.BR TR_BEGIN_CON (7)
primitive.
.
.TP
.I ABORT_cause
Specifies the (user) cause for the abort.
Abort causes are provider specific.
.
.TP
.I OPT_length
Specifies the length of the protocol options associated with the abort.
Supplying protocol options with the primitive is optional.
If the transaction user does not provide protocol options with the primitive, the
.I OPT_length
and
.I OPT_offset
fields must be set to zero (0) by the transaction user.
The format of the protocol options are provider specific.
.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
Specifies the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the protocol options begin.
Alignment of the protocol options in the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is not guaranteed.
However, the alignment of the protocol options in the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block are the same as was specified by the transport user.
.
.
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is only valid in connection-oriented mode.
.
.
.SS Originator
.PP
Transaction user.
.
.
.SS "Valid State"
.PP
This primitive is valid in any connection oriented transaction state other than
.BR TRS_IDLE .
.
.
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new state for the transaction is
.BR TRS_IDLE .
.
.
.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.PP
This primitive requires the transaction provider to generate the following acknowledgement on receipt
of the primitive, and the transaction user must wait for the acknowledgement before issuing any other
primitives:
.
.
.SS Successful
Correct acknowledgement of the primitive is indicated via the
.BR TR_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.
.
.
.SS Non-fatal errors
These errors will be indicated via the
.BR TR_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.
.
.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The allowable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.
.TP 16
.RB [ TRBADDATA ]
The amount of user data specified was invalid.
.
.TP
.RB [ TRBADID ]
The transaction identifier specified in the primitive was incorrect or invalid.
.
.TP
.RB [ TRNOTSUPPORT ]
This primitive is not supported by the transaction provider.
.
.TP
.RB [ TROUTSTATE ]
The primitive would place the transaction interface out of state.
.
.TP
.RB [ TRSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in
the primitive.
.
.
.
.SH "FILES"
.
.TP 16
