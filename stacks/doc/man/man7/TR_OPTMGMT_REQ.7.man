.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_OPTMGMT_REQ
\- Options Management
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of a
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TR_optmgmt_req {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always T_OPTMGMT_REQ */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* options length */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* options offset */
    ulong MGMT_flags;         /* options data flags */
} TR_optmgmt_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive allows the transaction user to manage the options associated with the
.IR stream .
The format of the message is one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
indicates the primitive type
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the protocol options associated with the primitive
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
block where the options begin.
.TP
.I MGMT_flags
are the flags which define the request made by the transaction user.
The allowable flags are:
.RS
.TP 12
.B TR_NEGOTIATE
Negotiate and set the options with the transaction provider
.TP
.B TR_CHECK
Check the validity of the specified options
.TP
.B TR_DEFAULT
Return the default options
.TP
.B TR_CURRENT
Return the currently effective option values.
.RE
.PP
The proper alignment of the options is not guaranteed.
The options are, however, aligned the same as received from the transaction user.
.SH RULES
.PP
For the rules governing the requests made by this primitive see the
.BR TR_OPTMGMT_ACK (7)
primitive.
.PP
This primitive requires the transaction provider to generate one of the following acknowledgments on
receipt of the primitive, and that the transaction user wait for the acknowledgment before issuing
any other primitives:
.SS Successful
Acknowledgment of the primitive via the
.BR TR_OPTMGMT_ACK (7).
.SS Non-fatal errors
These errors will be indicated via the
.BR TR_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.RB [ TRACCES ]
The user did not have proper permissions for the use of the requested options.
.TP
.RB [ TRBADFLAG ]
The flags as specified were incorrect or invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TRBADOPT ]
The options as specified were in an incorrect format, or they contained
invalid information.
.TP
.RB [ TROUTSTATE ]
The primitive would place the transaction interface out of state.
.TP
.RB [ TRNOTSUPPORT ]
This primitive is not supported by the transaction provider.
.TP
.RB [ TRSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in the primitive.
.SH MODES
.PP
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
Transaction user.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transaction Interface first appeared in OpenSS7.
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
This interface conforms to TRI Revision 0.9.2, Draft 1.
