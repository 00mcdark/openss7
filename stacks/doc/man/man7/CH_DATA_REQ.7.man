.TH CH_DATA_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Channel Interface (CHI)"
.SH NAME
.B CH_DATA_REQ, CH_data_req, CH_data_req_t
\- media data request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive is one optional
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks containing one or more bytes of media data.  The optional
.B M_PROTO
message block is structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CH_data_req {
    ch_ulong ch_primitive;      /* always CH_DATA_REQ */
    ch_ulong ch_slot;           /* slot within channel */
} CH_data_req_t;
\s+1\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Conveys media data for transmission from the channel service user to the
channel service provider.
.PP
The optional
.B M_PROTO
message block permits the result of a
.BR write (2)
operation to be passed directly to the CHI conforming provider.
.SH PARAMETERS
The primitive optionally contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I ch_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR CH_DATA_REQ .
.TP
.I ch_slot
specifies the slot to which the data belongs.  This is only valid for explicit
multipel slot channels (e.g, separated stereo or quadraphonic) and is
otherwise coded zero (0) by the channel service user and ignored by the
channel service provider.  When the
.I ch_slot
is insignificant, the optional
.B M_PROTO
message block does not need to be included by the channel service user, and
only the
.B M_DATA
message blocks need be specified.  Whenever the optional
.B M_PROTO
message block is not included,
.I ch_slot
is assumed to be zero (0).
.SH ORIGINATOR
Channel Service User.
.SH STATES
This primitive is valid in state
.BR CHS_CONNECTED
for the transmit direction.  The resulting state is unchanged.
.SH RULES
The following rules apply to the data included in the associated
.B M_DATA
message blocks:
.IP \(em 4
The data included in the associated
.B M_DATA
message blocks must contain at least one byte of data.  If there are no
associated
.B M_DATA
message blocks, or the associated blocks contain no data, the provider returns
the fatal error
.RB [ EPROTO ].
.PP
This primitive requires no acknowledgment but may return a fatal error.
.SH ERRORS
Fatal errors are as follows:
.TP
.RB [ EPROTO ]
The amount of data specified in the associated
.B M_DATA
message blocks is invalid.  That is, the amount of data is zero (0) or is too
large for the channel service provider.  The channel service provider is
allows to return this error if the data is larger than the channel block size
indicated in the
.BR CH_OPTMGMT_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CH_DATA_IND (7).
