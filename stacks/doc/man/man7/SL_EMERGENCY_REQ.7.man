.SH NAME
.B SL_EMERGENCY_REQ, sl_emergency_req_t
\- emergency request primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The emergency request service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
} sl_emergency_req_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The emergency request service primitive provides the SLS user with the ability
to specify that emergency alignment procedures should be used on the current or
next alignment of the signalling link.  Emergency alignment procedures a
shorter in duration (shorter proving period) than normal alignment procedures.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The emergency request service primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Specifies the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_EMERGENCY_REQ .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only valid in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state.  The primitive is valid in any link state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The management and link state remains unchanged.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS User.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
The emergency request service primitive does not require receipt
acknowledgement.
.IP \(en \w'\(en\(em'u
.B Successful:
When successful, the emergency request service primitive does not require
receipt acknowledgement.
.IP \(en
.B Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):
When unsuccessful, the SLS provider negatively acknowledges the primitive with
an
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive containing the error.
.\"
.SS Errors
.PP
.B Non-Fatal Errors:
applicable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.TP \w'\fBLMI_LAN_COLLISIONS\fR\(em'u
.B LMI_UNSPEC
Unknown or unspecified.
.PD 0
.TP
.B LMI_EVENT
Protocol-specific event occurred.
.TP
.B LMI_FATALERR
Device has become unusable.
.TP
.B LMI_OUTSTATE
Primitive was issued from invalid state.
.TP
.B LMI_PROTOSHORT
.BR M_PROTO (9)
block too short.
.TP
.B LMI_SYSERR
UNIX system error.
.TP
.B LMI_DEVERR
Start of device-specific error codes.
