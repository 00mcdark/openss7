.SH NAME
.B SL_OUT_OF_SERVICE_IND, sl_out_of_service_ind_t
\- out of service indication primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The out-of-service indication service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
    sl_ulong sl_timestamp;
    sl_ulong sl_reason;
} sl_out_of_service_ind_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The out-of-service indication service primitive is issued by the SLS provider
to indicate to the SLS user that a previously invoked link start has been
unsuccessful, or that a previously in-service signalling link has failed.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The out-of-service indication service primitive contains the following
parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Indicates the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_OUT_OF_SERVICE_IND .
.TP
.I sl_timestamp
Indication the time of the failure.  The time is indicated as UNIX time
from epoch in milliseconds.
.TP
.I sl_reason
Indicates the reason for failure to start the link or the reason for
failure of an in-service link.  The
.I sl_reason
field can assume one of the following values:
.sp
.RS
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_UNSPECIFIED
The signalling link failed for an unspecified reason.
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_CONG_TIMEOUT
The signalling link failed because of congestion timeout (T6 expiry).
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_ACK_TIMEOUT
The signalling link failed because of acknowledgement timeout (T7
expiry).
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_ABNORMAL_BSNR
The signalling link failed because of receipt of an abnormal backward
sequence number (BSNR).
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_ABNORMAL_FIBR
The signalling link failed because of receipt of an abnormal forward
indicator bit (FIBR).
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_SUERM_EIM
The signalling link failed because the SUERM or EIM error rate
threshold was exceeded.
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_ALIGNMENT_NOT_POSSIBLE
The signalling link failed because the AERM threshold was exceeded
and the maximum number of proving periods was exceeded.
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_RECEIVED_SIO
The signalling link failed due to receipt of an SIO during or after
alignment.
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_RECEIVED_SIN
The signalling link failed due to receipt of an SIN after proving.
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_RECEIVED_SIE
The signalling link failed due to receipt of an SIE after proving.
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_RECEIVED_SIOS
The signalling link failed due to receipt of an SIOS.
.TP
.B SL_FAIL_T1_TIMEOUT
The signalling link failed due to failure to align with remote (T1
timeout).
.RE
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only issued in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state.  This primitive is only issued from a link state other than
.B SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE
or
.BR SL_STATE_POWER_OFF .
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new link state is
.BR SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE .
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS Provider.
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The following rules are observed by the SLS provider when issuing the
out-of-service indication primitive:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The primitive is only issued in response to a
.BR SL_START_REQ (7)
primitive that
was issued from the
.B SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE
state, or as a result of a link
failure from the
.B SL_STATE_IN_SERVICE
state.
.IP \(em
The primitive is only issued once the signalling link has achieved the
.B SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE
state.
