.TH MG_ATTACH_REQ 7 "$Date: 2004/04/17 23:05:16 $" "$Name:  $" "Media Gateway Interface"
.SH NAME
.B MG_ATTACH_REQ, MG_attach_req, MG_attach_req_t
\- attach channel request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive is one
.BR M_PROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MG_attach_req {
    ulong mg_primitive;         /* always MG_ATTACH_REQ */
    ulong mg_mx_id;             /* multiplex id (or 0 for requesting stream) */
    ulong mg_mx_slot;           /* multiplex slot number */
    ulong mg_ch_id;             /* channel id (or 0 for provider assignment) */
    ulong mg_ch_type;           /* type of channel */
} MG_attach_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Requests that the specified slot on the requesting stream
.RI ( "mg_mx_id " "== 0)"
or specified multiplex
.RI ( "mg_mx_id " "!= 0)"
be associated with a newly created channel with specified
.RI ( "mg_ch_id " "!= 0)"
or provider assigned
.RI ( "mg_ch_id " "== 0)"
channel id.
.PP
This primitive is acknowledged with the
.BR MG_ATTACH_ACK (7).
.PP
If the requesting stream is closed, all channels attached to the requesting
stream will be detached.  Only channels that are associated with the
requesting stream need be assigned in this fashion.
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive has the following parameters:
.TP
.I mg_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR MG_ATTACH_REQ .
.TP
.I mg_mx_id
specifies the identifier of the multiplex from which to attach a channel.  If
the identifier is zero (0), it specifies the requesting stream as the
multiplex.
.TP
.I mg_mx_slot
specifies the slot within the specified multiplex to attach as a channel.
.TP
.I mg_ch_id
specifies the channel id to assign to the attached multiplex slot.  When zero
(0), it specifies that the MG provider is to assign a unique channel
identifier.
.TP
.I mg_ch_type
specifies the type of the channel.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Media gateway controller.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR MG_ATTACH_ACK (7).
