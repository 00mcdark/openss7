.SH NAME
.B LMI_ATTACH_REQ, lmi_attach_req_t
\- attach to PPA primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    lmi_long lmi_primitive;
    lmi_uchar lmi_ppa[0];
} lmi_attach_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This LMS user originated primitive requests that the stream upon which the
primitive is issued by associated with the specified Physical Point of
Attachment (PPA).  This primitive is only applicable to
.I Style 2
LMS provider streams, that is, streams that return
.B LMI_STYLE2
in the
.I lmi_ppa_style
field of the
.BR LMI_INFO_ACK (7).
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
The attach request primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP
.I lmi_primitive
Specifies the service primitive type.  Always
.BR LMI_ATTACH_REQ .
.TP
.I lmi_ppa
Specifies the Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) to which to associated the
.I Style 2
stream.  This is a variable length identifier whose length is determined by
the length of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SS State
This primitive is only valid in state
.B LMI_UNATTACHED
and when a local acknowledgement is not pending.
.\"
.\"
.SS "New State"
Upon success, the new state is
.BR LMI_ATTACH_PENDING .
Upon failure, the state remains unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SS Modes
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.\"
.SS Originator
This primitive is issued by the LMS User.
.\"
.\"
.SS Response
The attach request service primitive requires that the LMS provider respond as
follows:
.IP \(en \w'\(en\(em'u
.B Successful:
The LMS provider acknowledges receipt of the primitive and successful outcome
of the attach service with a
.BR LMI_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.  The new state is
.BR LMI_DISABLED .
.IP \(en
.B Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):
The LMS provider acknowledges receipt of the primitive and failure of the
attach service with a
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive containing the reason for failure.  The new state remains unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SS Errors
