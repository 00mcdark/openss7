.SH NAME
.B SL_CONGESTION_ACCEPT_REQ, sl_cong_accept_req_t
\- congestion accept request primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The congestion accept request service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
} sl_cong_accept_req_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The congestion accept request service primitive is used by the SLS user to
specify receive congestion onset.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The congestion accept request service primitive contains the following
parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Specifies the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_CONGESTION_ACCEPT_REQ .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is valid only in
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state.  It is valid
in
.B SL_STATE_IN_SERVICE
link state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The link and management state remains the same.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS User.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
The congestion accept request service primitive does not require receipt
acknowledgement.
.IP \(en \w'\(en\(em'u
.B Successful:
When successful, this primitive does not require acknowledgement.  The state
remains the same.
.IP \(en
.B Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):
When unsuccessful, the SLS provider negatively acknowledges the primitive
using the
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive containing the error and reason.  The state remains the same.
.PP
Note that if the SLS provider is in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
state, but the link is not in the
.B SL_STATE_IN_SERVICE
state, the primitive should be ignored and no non-fatal error generated.
.\"
.SS Errors
.PP
.B Non-Fatal Errors:
applicable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.TP \w'\fBLMI_LAN_COLLISIONS\fR\(em'u
.B LMI_UNSPEC
Unknown or unspecified.
.PD 0
.TP
.B LMI_EVENT
Protocol-specific event occurred.
.TP
.B LMI_FATALERR
Device has become unusable.
.TP
.B LMI_OUTSTATE
Primitive was issued from invalid state.
.TP
.B LMI_PROTOSHORT
.BR M_PROTO (9)
block too short.
.TP
.B LMI_SYSERR
UNIX system error.
.TP
.B LMI_DEVERR
Start of device-specific error codes.
