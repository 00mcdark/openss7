.TH TC_CONT_REQ 7 "$Date: 2004/10/25 09:16:12 $" "$Name:  $" "Transaction Component Interface (TCI)"
.SH NAME
.PP
.BR TC_CONT_REQ ", " TC_CONV_REQ
\- Dialogue Continue Request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks where each
.BR M_DATA (9)
message block contains zero or more bytes of data.
The format of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TC_cont_req {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TC_CONT_REQ */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* Options associated with the primitive */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* Options associated wtih the primitive */
    ulong DIALOG_id;          /* Dialog Identifier */
    ulong COMP_flags;         /* For use with ANSI CWP/CWOP */
} TC_cont_req_t;

typedef struct TC_cont_req TC_conv_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the TC provider that this message contains components.
.PP
Note that the maximum components size allowed by the TC provider is indicated to the TC user with
the
.BR TC_INFO_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
Always
.BR TC_CONT_REQ .
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the protocol options associated with the data.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the protocol options begin.
.TP
.I DIALOG_id
is the dialogue identifier assigned by the TC provider for the dialogue to which the components
belong.
.TP
.I COMP_flags
are the component flags associated with the components.  Component flags are TC provider specific.
.SH RULES
.PP
This primitive does not require any acknowledgments, although it may generate a fatal error.
This is indicated using a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message type which results in the failure of all operating system service routines on the stream.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.RB [ EPROTO ]
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
.RS
.IP - 3
The transaction service interface was found to be in an incorrect state.
If the transaction dialogue is in the
.B TCS_IDLE
state when the TC provider receives the
.B TC_CONT_REQ
primitive, then the TC provider should just drop the message without generating a fatal
error.
.IP -
The amount of TC user data associated with the primitive defines a transaction service data
unit larger than that allowed by the TC provider.
.SH MODES
.PP
Operation class 1, 2, or 3.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
TC user.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B <ss7/tc.h>
\- the transaction component interface header file.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR tci (7),
.BR M_PROTO (9),
.BR M_DATA (9),
.BR M_ERROR (9),
.BR TC_INFO_ACK (7),
.BR TC_CONT_IND (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transaction Component Interface first appeared in OpenSS7.
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
This interface conforms to TCI Revision 0.9.2, Draft 1.
