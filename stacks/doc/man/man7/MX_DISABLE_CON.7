\- multiplex disable confirmation
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MX_disable_con {
    ulong mx_primitive;         /* always MX_DISABLE_CON */
} MX_disable_con_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
Confirms that the multiplex service provider had disabled the multiplex
associated with the requesting stream.
.PP
This primitive is issued by the multiplex service provider after receiving a
.BR MX_DISABLE_REQ (7)
primitive from the multiplex service user.  It is used to confirm that the
multiplex associated with the stream upon which it is issued has been disabled
(removed from service).  Some multiplex service providers will issue this
primitive locally in response to the
.BR MX_DISABLE_REQ (7).
Other service providers will interact wtih the transmission peer or other
protocol modules before issuing the primitive.
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I mx_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR MX_DISABLE_CON .
.SH ORIGINATOR
Multiplex Service Provider.
.SH STATES
This primitive is valid in state
.BR MXS_WCON_RREQ .
The resulting state is
.BR MXS_ATTACHED .
