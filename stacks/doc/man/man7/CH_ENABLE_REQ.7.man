.TH CH_ENABLE_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Channel Interface (CHI)"
.SH NAME
.B CH_ENABLE_REQ, CH_enable_req, CH_enable_req_t
\- channel enable request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CH_enable_req {
    ch_ulong ch_primitive;      /* always CH_ENABLE_REQ */
} CH_enable_req_t;
\s+1\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Requests that the channel service provider enable the channel associated with
the stream.
.PP
Some channels provided by some channel service providers might require
interactions with the peer to enable the channel.  An example of such channel
types are
.BR rt (4)
channels and compressed channels.
.PP
This primitive is used to inform the underlying transmission device that the
requesting channel must be enabled
.IR "post haste" .
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I ch_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR CH_ENABLE_REQ .
.SH ORIGINATOR
Channel Service User.
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in state
.BR CHS_ATTACHED .
The resulting state is
.BR CHS_WACK_EREQ .
.SH RULES
These primitives require the channel service provider to generate one of the
following acknowledgments on receipt of the primitive, and the channel service
user must wait for the acknowledgment before issuing any other primitive:
.TP
.B Successful
Correct acknowledgment of the primitive is indicated with the
.BR CH_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.  In this case, the resulting state is
.BR CHS_WCON_EREQ .
.TP
.B Non-fatal errors
These errors will be indicated with the
.BR CH_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.  In this case, the resulting state is unchanged and remains the
same as the state in which the primitive was issued.
.SH ERRORS
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP
.RB [ CHSYSERR ]
UNIX system error.
A UNIX system error occured during the execution of the primitive, and the
UNIX error number,
.IR errno (3),
is indicated in the
.I ch_unix_error
field of the
.BR CH_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADADDR ]
.\"Bad address format or content.
.TP
.RB [ CHOUTSTATE ]
Interface out of state.
The primitive would place the interface out of state.  The
.B CH_ENABLE_REQ
primitive is only valid in state
.BR CHS_ENABLED .
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADOPT ]
.\"Bad options format or content.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADPARM ]
.\"Bad parameter format or content.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADPARMTYPE ]
.\"Bad paramater structure type.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADFLAG ]
.\"Bad flag.
.TP
.RB [ CHBADPRIM ]
Bad primitive.
The primitive type is not recognized or the primitive contained in the
.B M_PROTO
message block is poorly formatted.
.TP
.RB [ CHNOTSUPP ]
Primitive not supported.
The primitive type is recognized, but is not supported by the stream or the
channel service provider.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHNOADDR ]
.\"Address could not be assigned.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHADDRBUSY ]
.\"Address is busy.
