.TH CH_DISABLE_REQ 7 "$Date: 2005/01/26 07:57:57 $" "$Name:  $" "Channel Interface"
.SH NAME
.B CH_DISABLE_REQ, CH_disable_req, CH_disable_req_t
\- disable the channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CH_disable_req {
    ch_ulong ch_primitive;      /* always CH_DISABLE_REQ */
} CH_disable_req_t;
\s+1\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Requests that the channel service provider disable the channel associated with
the requesting stream.
.PP
Some channels provided by some channel service providers might require
interactions with the peer to disable the channel.  An example of such channel
types are
.BR rt (4)
channels and compressed channels.
.PP
This primitive is used to inform the underlying transmission device that the
requesting channel can be disabled.
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I ch_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR CH_DISABLE_REQ .
.SH ORIGINATOR
Channel Service User.
.SH STATE
This primitive is issued in state
.BR CHS_ENABLED .
The resulting state is
.BR CHS_ATTACHED .
.SH RULES
These primitives require the channel service provider to generate one of the
following acknowledgments on receipt of the primitive, and the channel service
user must wait for the acknowledgment before issuing any other primitives:
.TP
.B Successful
Correct acknowledgment of the primitive is indicated with the
.BR CH_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.  In this case, the resulting state is
.BR CHS_ATTACHED .
.TP
.B Non-fatal errors
These errors will be indicated with the
.BR CH_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.  In this case, the resultings tate is unchanged and remains the
same as the state in which the primitive was issued.
.SH ERRORS
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP
.RB [ CHSYSERR ]
UNIX system error.
A UNIX system error occured during the execution of the primitive and the UNIX
error number,
.IR errno (3),
is indicated in the
.I ch_unix_error
field of the
.BR CH_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADADDR ]
.\"Bad address format or content.
.TP
.RB [ CHOUTSTATE ]
Interface out of state.
The primitive would place the interfce out of state.  The
.B CH_DISABLE_REQ
primitive is only valid in state
.BR CHS_ENABLED .
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADOPT ]
.\"Bad options format or content.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADPARM ]
.\"Bad parameter format or content.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADPARMTYPE ]
.\"Bad paramater structure type.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHBADFLAG ]
.\"Bad flag.
.TP
.RB [ CHBADPRIM ]
Bad primitive.
The primitive type is unrecognized or the
.B M_PROTO
message block is poorly formatted.
.TP
.RB [ CHNOTSUPP ]
Primitive not supported.
This primitive type is recognized, but is not supported by the channel service
provider on the stream upon which it was issued.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHNOADDR ]
.\"Address could not be assigned.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CHADDRBUSY ]
.\"Address is busy.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CH_DISABLE_CON (7),
.BR CH_DISABLE_IND (7),
.BR CH_ERROR_ACK (7),
.BR CH_OK_ACK (7).
