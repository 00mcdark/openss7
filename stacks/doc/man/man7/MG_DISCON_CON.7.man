.SH NAME
.B MG_DISCON_CON, MG_discon_con, MG_discon_con_t
\- disconnect confirmation
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive is one
.BR M_PROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MG_discon_con {
    ulong mg_primitive;         /* always MG_DISCON_CON */
    ulong mg_se_id;             /* session id */
    ulong mg_tp_id;             /* disconnecting termination id */
} MG_discon_con_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Confirms that the requested disconnection primitive,
.BR MG_DISCON_REQ (7),
for the indicated communication session and termination point has been
successfully completed.
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive has the following parameters:
.TP
.I mg_primitive
indicates the primtive type.  Always
.BR MG_DISCON_CON .
.TP
.I mg_se_id
indicates the session id of the communication session within which the
termination point is confirmed disconnected.
.TP
.I mg_tp_id
indicates the termination point id of the termination point that is confirmed
disconnected.
.PP
Providing the
.IR mg_se_id " and " mg_tp_id
in the confirmation primitive permits multiple outstanding
.BR MG_DISCON_REQ (7)
primitives to each be confirmed separately and asynchronously.  The
.IR mg_se_id " and " mg_tp_id
in the
.B MG_DISCON_CON
is the same as the 
.IR mg_se_id " and " mg_tp_id
in the outstanding
.BR MG_DISCON_REQ (7)
primitive that is being confirmed.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Media gateway.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR MG_DISCON_REQ (7),
.BR MG_DISCON_IND (7).
.SH VERSIONS
This manpage was written for MGI Version 1.
