.TH T_CAPABILITY_REQ 7 "$Date: 2004/05/12 10:15:02 $" "$Name:  $" "Transport Provider Interface (TPI)"
.SH NAME
.B T_CAPABILITY_REQ
\- protocol capability acknowledgment
.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consists of an
.B M_PROTO
or
.B M_PCPROTO
message containing a  struct
T_capability_req which contains (at least) the following members:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct T_capablity_req {
    t_scalar_t    PRIM_type;    /* always T_CAPABILITY_REQ  */
                                /* must be the first field! */
    t_unscalar_t  CAP_bits1;    /* capability bits #1       */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive notifies the provider that the user requests certain provider
information and capabilities, and that it can make use of various
.B TPI
features
as encoded in the
.I CAP_bits1
field (see below).
.SH PARAMETERS
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
This    indicates    the   primitive   type   and   is   always
.BR T_CAPABILITY_REQ (7).
This  field must be strictly the first field to allow
receivers to determine the message type.
.TP
.I CAP_bits1
This  is a 32-bit field with zero or more of the following bits set, all other
bits must be zero:
.RS
.TP
.B TC1_INFO
If  set,  his  bit requests the provider information as if the
.B T_CAPABILITY_REQ
were a
.BR T_INFO_REQ .
.TP
.B TC1_ACCEPTOR_ID
If  set,  this  bit  requests  that the provider supply an acceptor identifier
for use in a
.BR T_CONN_RES .
.TP
.B Extensibility
In  addition the following bit is reserved for future use:
.BR TC1_CAP_BITS2 .
This bit may later be used to enable another 32 capability bits, but must not
currently be set.
.SH RULES
This primitive may be sent at any time.  It can be sent as either an
.B M_PROTO
or
.BR M_PCPROTO ,
and  must  be  responded  to with the same message type as
itself.
.SH MODES
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport user.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR T_CAPABILITY_ACK (7),
.BR T_ERROR_ACK (7).
