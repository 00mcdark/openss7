.TH MX_ENABLE_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Multiplex Interface (MXI)"
.SH NAME
.B MX_ENABLE_REQ, MX_enable_req, MX_enable_req_t
\- multiplex enable request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MX_enable_req {
    ulong mx_primitive;         /* always MX_ENABLE_REQ */
} MX_enable_req_t;
\s+1\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Requests that the multiplex associated with the requesting stream and the
attached channels be enabled.
.PP
Some multiplex provided by some multiplex service providers might require
interactions with the transmission peer to enable the multiplex.  An example
of such multiplex types are the H.223 multiplex and compressed channel
multiplexes.
.PP
This primitive is used to inform the underlying transmission device that the
requesting multiplex must be enabled
.IR "post haste" .
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I mx_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR MX_ENABLE_REQ .
.SH ORIGINATOR
Multiplex Service User.
.SH STATES
This primitive is valid in state
.BR MXS_ATTACHED .
The resulting state is
.BR MXS_WACK_EREQ .
.SH RULES
These primitives require the multiplex service provider to generate one of the
following acknowledgments on receipt of the primitive, and the multiplex
service user must wait for the acknowledgment before issuing any other
primitives:
.TP
.B Successful:
Correct acknowledgment of the primitive is indicated with the
.BR MX_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.  In this case, the resulting state is
.BR MXS_WCON_EREQ .
.TP
.B Non-fatal errors:
These errors will be indicated with the
.BR MX_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.  In this case, the resulting state is unchanged and remains the
same as the state in which the primitive was issued.
.SH ERRORS
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.RB [ MXSYSERR ]
UNIX system error.
A UNIX system error occured during the execution of the primitive and the UNIX
error number,
.IR errno (3),
is indicated in the
.I mx_unix_error
field of the
.BR MX_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ MXBADADDR ]
.\"Bad address format or content.
.\"The specified address was poorly formatted or contained invalid information.
.TP
.RB [ MXOUTSTATE ]
Interface out of state.
The primitive would place the interface out of state.  The
.B MX_ENABLE_REQ
primitive is valid only in the
.B MXS_ATTACHED
state.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ MXBADOPT ]
.\"Bad options format or content.
.\"The options specified were poorly formatted or contains invalid information.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ MXBADPARM ]
.\"Bad parameter format or content.
.\"A parameter contained in the specified options was poorly formatted or
.\"contained invalid information.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ MXBADPARMTYPE ]
.\"Bad paramater structure type.
.\"The structure type within the options was unrecognized or invalid.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ MXBADFLAG ]
.\"Bad flag.
.\"The flags specified were invalid.
.TP
.RB [ MXBADPRIM ]
Bad primitive.
The primitive type was unrecognized or the primitive was poorly formatted.
.TP
.RB [ MXNOTSUPP ]
Primitive not supported.
The primitive type was recognized, but is not supported on the requesting
stream or by the multiplex service provider.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ MXBADSLOT ]
.\"Bad multplex slot.
.\"The slot specified in field
.\".I mx_slot
.\"was invalid or out of range.

.BR MX_OK_ACK (7),
