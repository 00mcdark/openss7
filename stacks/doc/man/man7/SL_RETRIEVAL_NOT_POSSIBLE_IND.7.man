.SH NAME
.B SL_RETRIEVAL_NOT_POSSIBLE_IND, sl_retrieval_not_poss_ind_t
\- retrieval not possible indication primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The retrieval not possible indication service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
} sl_retrieval_not_poss_ind_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The retrieval not possible indication service primitive is originated by the
SLS provider to indicate that the updated contents of the retransmission and
transmission buffers is not possible.  The primitive is issued in response to
a
.BR SL_RETREIVAL_REQUEST_AND_FSNC_REQ (7)
primitive received from the SLS user.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The retrieval not possible indication service primitive contains the following
parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Indicates the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_RETRIEVAL_NOT_POSSIBLE_IND .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only issued from the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state, but may be issued from any link state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new state remains unchanged.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS Provider.
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The SLS provider observes the following rules when issuing the retrieval not
possible indication service primitive:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The primitive is only issued from the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state, but may be issued from any link state.
.IP \(em
The primitive is only issued in response to an outstanding
.BR SL_RETRIEVAL_REQUEST_AND_FSNC_REQ (7)
primitive when it is not possible to update and retrieve the updated contents
of the retransmission and transmission buffers.
.IP \(em
When issued, a non-fatal error will not be issued for the same request.
.IP \(em
Upon receipt of the primitive, the SLS user shall consider the retrieval
operation complete.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
The primitive does not require a response from the SLS user.
