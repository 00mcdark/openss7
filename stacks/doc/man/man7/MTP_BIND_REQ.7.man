.SH NAME
.B MTP_BIND_REQ
\- Bind to an MTP-SAP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The format of the MTP bind request is one
.B M_PROTO
message block, formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MTP_bind_req {
    mtp_ulong mtp_primitive;    /* always MTP_BIND_REQ */
    mtp_ulong mtp_addr_length;  /* length of MTP address */
    mtp_ulong mtp_addr_offset;  /* offset of MTP address */
    mtp_ulong mtp_bind_flags;   /* bind flags */
} MTP_bind_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Binds the requesting stream to an MTP address.
.SS Parameters
.PP
.TP
.I mtp_primitive
Always \fCMTP_BIND_REQ\fR.
.TP
.I mtp_addr_length
The length of the address to bind to the requesting stream.
.TP
.I mtp_addr_offset
The offset of the address to bind to the requesting stream from the start of
the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.TP
.I mtp_bind_flags
Bind flags.  See
.I \*(lqFlags\*(rq
below.
.SS Flags
.PP
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is valid in state
.BR MTPS_UNBND .
Upon success, the new state is
.BR MTPS_WACK_BREQ .
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is originated by the MTP User.
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is valid in all modes.
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
.HP
.I Successful:
Successful acknowledgement is performed with the
.BR MTP_BIND_ACK (7)
primitive.
.HP
.I Non-fatal Errors:
Non-fatal errors are indicated with the
.BR MTP_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.TP
.RB [ MSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux \(rg
system error occured and the
.IR errno (3)
is in the
.I UNIX_error
field of the
.BR MTP_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.TP
.RB [ MACCESS ]
The MTP User did not have sufficient permissions to bind the specified
address.
.TP
.RB [ MBADADDR ]
The address was poorly formatted or contained invalid information.
.TP
.RB [ MNOADDR ]
No address was provided and the MTP Provider could not assign one.
.TP
.RB [ MBADPRIM ]
The primitive is unknown to the MTP Provider or was improprerly formatted.
.TP
.RB [ MOUTSTATE ]
The primitive would place the interface out of state.
.TP
.RB [ MNOTSUPP ]
The primitive is known but not supported by the MTP Provider.
.TP
.RB [ MBADFLAG ]
The
.I mtp_bind_flags
field contained invalid flags.
