.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_ADDR_ACK
\- Protocol Address Acknowledgement
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s+1\
typedef struct TR_addr_ack {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_ADDR_ACK */
    ulong LOCADDR_length;
    ulong LOCADDR_offset;
    ulong REMADDR_length;
    ulong REMADDR_offset;
} TR_addr_ack_t;
\fR\s-1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the transaction user the local and remote protocol addresses currently
associated with the transaction endpoint or association.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
the primitive type.  Always
.BR TR_ADDR_ACK .
.TP
.I LOCADDR_length
the length of the local address associated with the transaction endpoint.
.TP
.I LOCADDR_offset
the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block where the local address begins. 
.TP
.I REMADDR_length
the length of the remote address associated with the transaction endpoint.
.TP
.I REMADDR_offset
the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block where the remote address begins. 
.PP
The proper alignment of the addresses in the
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block is not guaranteed. 
.SH RULES
.PP
If the requested transaction identifier was -1 in the corresponding
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive, and the transaction endpoint is not bound to a local address, the
.I LOCADDR_length
and
.I LOCADDR_offset
fields must be set to 0.
.PP
If the requested transaction exists as identifed in the corresponding
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive,
.I LOCADDR_length
and
.I LOCADDR_offset
fields will be populated to reflect the local association address for the specified transaction.
.PP
If the requested transaction identifier was -1 in the corresponding
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive, the
.I REMADDR_length
and
.I REMADDR_offset
fields must be set to 0.
.PP
If the requested transaction exists as identified in the corresponding
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7)
primitive,
.I REMADDR_length
and
.I REMADDR_offset
fields will be populated to reflect the remote association address for the specified transaction.
.SH MODES
.PP
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
Transaction provider.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR tri (7),
.BR M_PCPROTO (9),
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transaction Interface first appeared for OpenSS7.
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
This interface conforms to TRI Revision 0.9.2, Draft 1.
