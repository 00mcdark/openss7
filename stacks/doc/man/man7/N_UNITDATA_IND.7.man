.TH N_UNITDATA_IND 7 "$Date: 2004/05/12 10:15:00 $" "$Name:  $" "Network Provider Interface (NPI)"
.SH NAME
.BR N_UNITDATA_IND " (" N_unitdata_ind_t )
\- unit data indication
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the NS user that a datagram has been received from
the specified source address.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of the message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
blocks containing at least one byte of data.  The format of the
.B M_PROTO
is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;            /* always N_UNITDATA_IND */
    ulong DEST_length;          /* destination address length */
    ulong DEST_offset;          /* destination address offset */
    ulong SRC_length;           /* source address length */
    ulong SRC_offset;           /* source address offset */
    ulong ERROR_type;           /* specifies the reason for the 
                                   error */
} N_unitdata_ind_t;
\fR\s+1

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

.TP
.I DEST_length
Indicates the length of the destination address.  The address is the same as in
the corresponding
.BR N_UNITDATA_REQ (7)
primitive.

.TP
.I DEST_offset
Indicates the offset of the destination address from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.

.TP
.I SRC_length
Indicates the length of the source network address.  This address is the same
as the value associated with the stream on which the
.BR N_UNITDATA_REQ (7) was issued.

.TP
.I SRC_offset
Indicates the offset of the source address from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.

.TP
.I ERROR_type
Specifies the reason for the error.  The possible values are:
.RS

.TP
.B N_UD_CONGESTION
This packet experienced congestion during its delivery.
.RE
.SH STATES
This primitive is valid in state
.BR NS_IDLE .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state remains unchanged.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Network Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
