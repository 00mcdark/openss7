.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_END_IND
\- Transaction End Indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block
followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks if any user data is associated with the primitive.
The format of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TR_end_ind {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_END_IND */
    ulong CORR_id;            /* Correlation id */
    ulong TRANS_id;           /* Transaction id */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* Options structure length */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* Options structure offset */
} TR_end_ind_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the transaction user that the user on the other side of the association
is finished sending data.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
.TP
.I CORR_id
is the transaction user assigned transaction identifier corresponding to a
.BR TR_BEGIN_REQ (7)
primitive issued by the transaction user.
This field is -1, unless the
.B TR_END_IND
is in response to a
.BR TR_BEGIN_REQ (7).
.TP
.I TRANS_id
is the transaction provider assigned transaction identifier.
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the protocol options associated with the primitive and user data.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offest from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the protocol options begin.
.SH MODES
.PP
Only connection-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
Transaction provider.
