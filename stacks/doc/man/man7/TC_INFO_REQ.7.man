.PP
The format of the message is one
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block.
The format of the
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TC_info_req {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TC_INFO_REQ */
} TC_info_req_t;

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests the TC provider to return the sizes of all relevant protocol
parameters, plus the current state of the TC provider.
.PP

and
.BR TC_INFO_ACK (7)
primitives have no effect on the state of the TC provider and do not appear in the state
tables.

.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
indicates the primitive type.
Always
.BR TC_INFO_REQ .
