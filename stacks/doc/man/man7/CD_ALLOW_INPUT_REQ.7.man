.TH CD_ALLOW_INPUT_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Communications Device Interface (CDI)"
.SH NAME
.B CD_ALLOW_INPUT_REQ
\- allow input
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
or
.B M_PCPROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
} cd_allow_input_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This user originated primitive requests that an enabled communications device
permanently allow the input section.
.PP
When a stream is enabled with
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7),
it can be used for transmission.  If the stream returns
.B CD_AUTOALLOW
in the
.I cd_features
field of the
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7),
the device automatically allows input and there is no need to call the
.BR CD_ALLOW_INPUT_REQ
primitive for the device, unless
.BR CD_HALT_INPUT_REQ (7)
has been successfully called beforehand.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Specifies the primitives type.
.SS State
This primitive is valid in the
.BR CD_ENABLED
state.
When successful, the new state is
.BR CD_INPUT_ALLOWED .
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires that the provider acknowledge receipt of the primitive
as follows:
.PP
.B "Successful:"
When successful, the provider acknowledges the receipt of this primitive with
the
.BR CD_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.  The new state is
.BR CD_INPUT_ALLOWED .
.PP
.B "Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):"
When unsuccessful, the provider acknowledges the receipt of this primitive
with the
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.  The reason for failure is provided in the error field of the
primitive.  The state remains unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.B "Non-Fatal Errors:"
applicable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_BADADDRESS ]
.\"Address was invalid.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_BADADDRTYPE ]
.\"Invalid address type.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_BADDIAL ]
.\"Dial information was invalid.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_BADDIALTYPE ]
.\"Invalid dial information type.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_BADDISPOSAL ]
.\"Invalid disposal parameter.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_BADFRAME ]
.\"Defective SDU received.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_BADPPA ]
.\"Invalid PPA identifier.
.TP
.RB [ CD_BADPRIM ]
Unrecognized primitive.
.TP
.RB [ CD_DISC ]
Disconnected.
.TP
.RB [ CD_EVENT ]
Protocol-specific event occurred.
.TP
.RB [ CD_FATALERR ]
Device has become unusable.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_INITFAILED ]
.\"Line initialization failed.
.TP
.RB [ CD_NOTSUPP ]
Primitive not supported by this device.
.TP
.RB [ CD_OUTSTATE ]
Primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ CD_PROTOSHORT ]
M_PROTO block too short.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_READTIMEOUT ]
.\"Read request timed out before data arrived.
.TP
.RB [ CD_SYSERR ]

.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_WRITEFAIL ]
.\"Unitdata request failed.
.PP
.B Note:
If the input section is already allowed and this primitive is issued in the
.B CD_INPUT_ALLOWED
state, the provider should ignore the primitive and not generate a non-fatal
error.
