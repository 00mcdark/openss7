.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consist of one
.BR M_PCPROTO
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MTP_transfer_ind {
    mtp_ulong mtp_primitive;
    mtp_ulong mtp_srce_length;
    mtp_ulong mtp_srce_offset;
    mtp_ulong mtp_mp;
    mtp_ulong mtp_sls;
} MTP_transfer_ind_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates that the MTP provider has received a transfer for the
MTP User from the indicated source address.
.SH Parameters
.TP
.I mtp_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR MTP_TRANSFER_IND .
.TP
.I mtp_srce_length
indicates the length of the source address of the transfer.
.TP
.I mtp_srce_offset
indicates the offset of the source address of the transfer from the beginning
of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the adddress begins.
.TP
.I mtp_mp
indicates the priority of the message.
.TP
.I mtp_sls
indicates the signalling link selection for the message.
.SH States
This primitive is issued in the
.BR MTPS_IDLE " or " MTPS_DATA_XFER
states.  The new state remains unchanged.
.SH Modes
This primitive is issued in any mode; however, in connection oriented mode the
indication of the source address is optional and
.I mtp_srce_length
may be zero (0).
.SH Originator
This primitive is issued by the MTP provider.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR MTP_INFO_ACK (7),
.BR MTP_TRANSFER_REQ (7).
.SH VERSIONS
The Message Transfer Part (MTP) Interface (MTPI) is unique to
.BR OpenSS7 .
This is Version 2 of the interface.
