.SH NAME
.B CC_DISCONNECT_IND
\- disconnect indication
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_disconnect_ind {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_DISCONNECT_IND */
    ulong cc_call_ref;          /* call reference */
    ulong cc_cause;             /* cause value */
    ulong cc_opt_length;        /* optional parameter length */
    ulong cc_opt_offset;        /* optional parameter offset */
} CC_disconnect_ind_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the calling CCS user that there is in-band
information now available in the voice channel.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_DISCONNECT_IND .
.TP
.I cc_call_ref
indicates the call reference.  The call reference is used by the CCS provider
to identify the call.
.TP
.I cc_cause
indicates the cause value for the disconnect.
.TP
.I cc_opt_length
indicates the length of the optional parameters associated with the in-band
information request.  If no optional parameters are associated with the in
band information request, then this parameter must be coded zero.
.TP
.I cc_opt_offset
indicates the offset of the optional parameters from the start of the M_PROTO
message block.
