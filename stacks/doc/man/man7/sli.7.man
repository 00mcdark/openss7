.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This man page describes the STREAMS interface which is used to configure and
exchange data with an SS7 Signalling Link Interface (SLI) for all SS7 devices
conforming to the \fIOpenSS7\fR Signalling Link Interface (SLI) specification.
.SS "LOCAL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE"
.PP
.PP
SLI drivers are normally linked using \fBstreamio\fR(2) \fBI_LINK\fR ioctl
commands under a Signalling Link Set (SLS) STREAMS multiplexor conforming to
the Signalling Link Set Interface (SLSI) specification \fBslsi\fR(7) such as
\fBsls\fR(4), by the SS7 Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8).  Yet, this
interface is available for the purpose of ferry-clip conformance and
diagnostic testing of the SS7 Signalling Link.
.PP
SLI \fRStype 1\fR and \fIStyle 2\fR drivers may be configured to automatically
link under the \fBsls\fR(4) multiplexor and appear as \fBslsi\fR(7) drivers.
Not all SS7 drivers need be written to the SL or lower interfaces: drivers may
be written to the \fBslsi\fR(7) and even \fBmtpi\fR(7) interfaces.
.PP
SLI provides a local management interface which utilizes \fBM_PROTO\fR and
\fBM_PCPROTO\fR messages which can be exchanged with the interface using
\fBputmsg\fR(2) and \fBgetmsg\fR(2) system calls on the stream head once the
interface is opened.  The local management interfae controls local management
(STREAMS configuration functions) which are normally used by the SS7
Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8) on the driver interface before linking
under an \fBsls\fR(4) multiplexor.
.PP
The Local Management Interface (LMI) is common to all \fIOpenSS7\fR drivers
and modules and is described in detail in \fBlmi\fR(7).
.SS "DEVICE CONTROL INTERFACE"
.PP
.PP
SLI provides a device control interface which utilizes \fBioctl\fR(2)
transparent calls or an \fBI_STR\fR ioctl under \fBstreamio\fR(2) from a
stream head or multiplexor control channel to the driver.  The device control
interface controls aspects of the SL driver device which are outside the scope
of the SS7 protocol.  These controls are normally issued by the SS7
Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8) on the driver interface or multiplexor
control channel before or after the protocol stack has been assembled.
.PP
The device control interface (DEVI) is common to all \fIOpenSS7\fR drivers and
modules and is described in detail in \fBdevi\fR(7).
.SS "PROTOCOL SERVICE INTERFACE"
.PP
.PP
SLI provides a protocol service interface which uses \fBM_DATA\fR,
\fBM_PROTO\fR and \fBM_PCPROTO\fR STREAMS messages which can be exchanged with
\fBwrite\fR(2), \fBread\fR(2), \fBputmsg\fR(2) or \fBgetmsg\fR(2) system calls
on the stream head, or which can be exchanged with the driver by upstream
pushed or linked modules.  The protocol service interface exchanges SS7
protocol service primitives between the Signalling Link (SL) and the
Signalling Link Set (SLS), but may also be used for ferry-clip conformance
testing or diagnostics.
.PP
The protocol service interface for SLI is described in detail in section
\fIPROTOCOL SERVICE INTERFACE\fR, below.
.SS "PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE"
.PP
.PP
SLI provides a protocol mangement interface which uses \fBM_CTL\fR messages
between modules or \fBM_IOCTL\fR messages from a stream head or multiplexor
control channel.  This interface uses the controls defined in the Local
Management Interface (LMI) as detailed under
\fIINPUT OUTPUT CONTROL INTERFACE\fR in \fBlmi\fR(7).  The protocol management
interface provides protocol configuration, state inquiry, statistics and event
management (SNMP functions).  This interface is normally used by the SS7
Configuration Daemon \fBss7d\fR(8) on the stream after opening or during
operation.
.PP
The protocol service interface for SLI is described in detail in section
\fIPROTOCOL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE\fR below.

.SH "PROTOCOL SERVICE INTERFACE"
.PP
.PP
Protocol service interface commands are from the stream head to the SL driver
using \fBputmsg\fR(2) and \fBgetmsg\fR(2) commands as follows:

.RS 4
.nf
\fIfd\fB = open("\fI/dev/sl\fB");
\fIret\fB = putmsg(\fIfd\fB, \fIctlptr\fB, \fIdataptr\fB, \fIflags\fB);
\fIret\fB = getmsg(\fIfd\fB, \fIctlptr\fB, \fIdataptr\fB, \fIflags\fB);
.fi
.RE
.PP
Downstream messages are sent from the stream head using \fBputmsg\fR(2);
upstream messages are received at the stream head using \fBgetmsg\fR(2).
.PP
\fIflags\fR is either \fBRS_HIPRI\fR or not indicating a \fBM_PCPROTO\fR
or an \fBM_PROTO\fR message respectively.  \fIctlptr\fR and \fIdataptr\fR are
pointers to a \fBstrbuf\fR structure which contains the following members:

.RS 4
.nf
struct strbuf {
    int     maxlen;
    int     len;
    void    *buf;
};
.fi

data collection within the SL provider.
.PP
\fIic_cmd\fR contains one of the following collection commands:
.TP
