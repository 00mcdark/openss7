.TH DL_TOKEN_ACK 7 "$Date: 2004/04/17 23:05:15 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux Fast-STREAMS"
.SH NAME
.B DL_TOKEN_ACK (dl_token_ack_t)
\- this message is sent in response to
.BR DL_TOKEN_REQ (7);
it conveys the connection response token assigned to the stream.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block, which contains the following structure.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_token;
} dl_token_ack_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_TOKEN_ACK .
.TP
.I dl_token
conveys the connection response token associated with the stream.  This
value must be a non-zero value.  The DLS provider will generate a token value
for each stream upon receipt of the first
.BR DL_TOKEN_REQ (7)
primitive issued on that stream.  The same token value will be returned in
response to all subsequent
.BR DL_TOKEN_REQ (7)
primitives issued on a stream.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in any state in response to a
.BR DL_TOKEN_REQ (7).
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is unchanged.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
