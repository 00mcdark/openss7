.SH NAME
.B CH_DATA_IND, CH_data_ind, CH_data_ind_t
\- media data indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive is one optional
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one ore more
.B M_DATA
message blocks containing one or more bytes of media data.
The optional
.B M_PROTO
message block is strucutred as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CH_data_ind {
    ch_ulong ch_primitive;      /* always CH_DATA_IND */
    ch_ulong ch_slot;           /* slot within channel */
} CH_data_ind_t;
\s+1\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Conveys received media data from the channel service provider to channel
service user.
.SH PARAMETERS
The primitive optionally contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I ch_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CH_DATA_IND .
.TP
.I ch_slot
indicates the slot to which the data belongs.  This is only valid for explicit
multiple slot channels (e.g, separated stereo or quadraphonic) and is
otherwise coded zero (0) by the channel service provider and ignored by the
channel service user.  When the
.I ch_slot
is insignificant, the optional
.B M_PROTO
message block is not included by the channel service provider, and only the
.B M_DATA
message blocks are indicated.
Whenever the optional
.B M_PROTO
message block is not included,
.I ch_slot
is assumed to be zero (0).
.SH ORIGINATOR
Channel Service Provider.
.SH STATES
This primitive is valid in state
.B CHS_CONNECTED
for the receive direction.
The resulting state is unchanged.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CH_DATA_REQ (7).
