This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CH_disable_ind {
    ch_ulong ch_primitive;      /* always CH_DISABLE_IND */
    ch_ulong ch_cause;          /* cause for disable */
} CH_disable_ind_t;
\s+1\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Indicates that an autonomous disabling of the channel associated with the
stream upon which the primitive is issued.
.PP
This primitive indicates that an error or other asynchronous event has occured
that has resulted in the autonomous disabling of the channel associated with
the stream upon which the primitive is issued.
.PP
Not all service providers will necessarily issue this primitive.
