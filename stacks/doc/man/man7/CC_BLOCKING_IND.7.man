.SH NAME
.B CC_BLOCKING_IND
\- circuit management blocking indication
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_blocking_ind {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_BLOCKING_IND */
    ulong cc_flags;             /* blocking flags */
    ulong cc_addr_length;       /* address length */
    ulong cc_addr_offset;       /* address offset */
} CC_blocking_ind_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates that the peer CCS user has requested that the
specified call control address(es) (signalling interface and circuit
identifiers) be remotely blocked.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_BLOCKING_IND .
.TP
.I cc_flags
Specifies the options flags.  See
.IR \*(lqFlags\*(rq ,
below.
.TP
.I cc_addr_length
Indicates the length of the call control address(es) (signalling interface and
circuit identifiers) that the peer CCS user has requested to be remotely
blocked.
.TP
.I cc_addr_offset
Specifies the offset of the call control address(es) from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SS Flags
The options flags are protocol and provider-specific.  For additional
information, see the specific Addendum.
.\"
.\"
.SS State
This primitive will only be issued by the CCS provider if the remote blocking
state of the specified address(es) is
.BR CCS_UNBLOCKED " or " CCS_BLOCKED .
The new remote blocking state will be
.B CCS_WRES_BLIND
for the specified call control addresses.
.\"
.\"
.SS Modes
This primitive will only be issued by the CCS provider for signalling
interfaces in the NNI mode.
.\"
.\"
.SS Originator
This primitive is originated by the CC User.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTES
This primitive is only currently supported for ISUP conforming CCS providers
and will not be issued by any other provider.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B "Rules for Q.764 and ANSI T1.113 conformance:"
.PP
CCS providers conforming to Q.764 or ANS T1.113 adhere to the following
additional rules:
(See also
.BR cci_isup (7)
for address format and
.BR isup (4))
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em 4
The
.I cc_flags
is a bitwise OR of any of the following flags:
.RS
.TP
.B ISUP_GROUP
When set, this flag indicates that the operation is to be performed on a
group of call control addresses and that any circuit identifier in the
specified call control address is to be interpreted by the CCS provider as a
circuit group identifier.
.TP
.B ISUP_MAINTENANCE_ORIENTED
When set, this flag confirms that the operation to be performed is for
maintenance oriented blocking.
.TP
.B ISUP_HARDWARE_FAILURE_ORIENTED
When set, this flag confirms that the operation to be performed is for
hardware failure oriented blocking.
.RE
.\"
.IP \(em
One and only one of
.BR ISUP_MAINTENANCE_ORIENTED " and " ISUP_HARDWARE_FAILURE_ORIENTED
must be set.
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
When
.B ISUP_HARDWARE_FAILURE_ORIENTED
is set,
.B ISUP_GROUP
is implied and need not be indicated by the CCS provider.
.\"
.\"
.IP \(em
When
.B ISUP_GROUP
is set, the call control address must be an address of scope
.BR ISUP_SCOPE_CG ;
when not set,
.BR ISUP_SCOPE_CT .
