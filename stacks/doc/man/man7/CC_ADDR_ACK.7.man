.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive acknowledges the corresponding request primitive and is used by
the CCS provider to return information concerning the bound and connected
protocol addresses for the stream.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_ADDR_ACK .
.TP
.I cc_bind_length
Indicates the length of the bound call control address.
.TP
.I cc_bind_offset
Indicates the offset of the bound call control address.
.TP
.I cc_call_ref
Indicates the call reference for the connected call control address.
.TP
.I cc_conn_length
Indicates the length of the connected call control address.
.TP
.I cc_conn_offset
Indicates the offset of the connected call control address.
.\"
.\"
.SS Rules
.IP \(em 4
If the requesting stream is not bound to a call control address, the CCS
provider will code the
.IR cc_bind_length " and " cc_bind_offset
fields to zero.
Otherwise, the CCS provider will return the same call control address that
was returned in the
.BR CC_BIND_ACK (7).
.IP \(em
If the requesting stream is not connected to a call, the CCS provider will
code the
.IR cc_conn_length " and " cc_conn_offset
fields to zero.  Otherwise, the CCS provider will indicate the call control
address (circuit) upon which the call is connected.
.\"
.\"
.SS State
This primitive is valid in state
.BR CCS_WACK_AREQ .
.\"
.\"
.SS "New State"
The new state is the state previous to the
.BR  CC_ADDR_REQ (7).
.\"
.\"
.SS Modes
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.\"
.SS Originator
This primitive is issued by the CC Provider.
