.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B TPI-SSCOP
provides a stream supporting the Transport Provider Interface
.RB ( tpi (7))
to the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol
.RB ( sscop (4)).
This
.IR STREAMS (4)
interface provides the
.BR sscop (4)
protocol service interface using the T-primitives of the
.BR tpi (7).
This interface is intended solely for use by user programs or protocol modules
requiring the common
.BR tpi (7)
interface such as the
.BR xti (3)
.BR timod (4)
and the
.BR sockets (3)
.BR sockmod (4)
or
.BR socksys (4).
