.SH NAME
.B SL_RB_CLEARED_IND, sl_rb_cleared_ind_t
\- receive buffer cleared indication primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The RB cleared indication service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
} sl_rb_cleared_ind_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The RB cleared indication service primitive is originated by the SLS provider
whenever the receive buffer has been cleared; either in response to a
.BR SL_CLEAR_BUFFERS_REQ (7)
primitive from the SLS user, or due to internal state machine operations.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The RB cleared indication service primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Indicates the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_RB_CLEARED_IND .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only issued by the SLS provider in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state and the
.B SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE
link state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new state remains unchanged.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS Provider.
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The SLS provider observes the following rules when issuing the RB cleared
indication service primitive:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The primitive is only issued from the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state and the
.B SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE
link state.
.IP \(em
The primitive is issued in response to a
.BR SL_CLEAR_BUFFERS_REQ (7)
primitive from the SLS user.
.IP \(em
The primitive is also issued in response to internal state machine
transitions.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
This primitive does not require a response from the SLS user.
