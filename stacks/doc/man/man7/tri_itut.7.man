\- Transaction Interface \(em Corrigendum for ITU-T Q.771 Conformance
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <ss7/tr.h>
.HP
.BI "int " fd " = open(" device ", " flags );
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B TRI-ITUT
provides a
.I stream
supporting the Transaction Interface
.BR "" ( tri (7))
.[
tri
.]
to the Transaction Capabilities Application Part
.BR "" ( tcap (4))
for ITUT Q.771
.[
q771
.]
operation.
This
.IR STREAMS (4)
interface provides the
.BR tcap (4)
protocol service interface using the TR-primitives of the
.BR tri (7).
This interface is intended solely for use by user programs or protocol modules requiring the
.BR tri (7)
interface, such as
.BR map (4).
