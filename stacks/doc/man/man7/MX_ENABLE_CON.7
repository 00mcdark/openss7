.SH NAME
.B MX_ENABLE_CON, MX_enable_con, MX_enable_con_t
\- multiplex enable confirmation
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct MX_enable_con {
    ulong mx_primitive;         /* always MX_ENABLE_CON */
} MX_enable_con_t;
\s+1\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Confirms that the multiplex associated with the stream upon which the
primitive is issued has been enabled (prepared for transmission service).
.PP
This primitive is issued by the multiplex service provider after receiving a
.BR MX_ENABLE_REQ (7)
primitive from the muliplex service user.  It is used to confirm that the
multiplex associated with the stream upon which it is issued has been enabled
(preparted for transmission service).  Some multiplex service providers will
issue this primitive locally in response to the
.BR MX_ENABLE_REQ (7).
Other service providers will interact with the transmission peer or other
protocol modules before issuing the primitive.
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I mx_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR MX_ENABLE_CON .
.SH ORIGINATOR
Multiplex Service Provider.
.SH STATES
This primitive is valid in state
.BR MXS_WCON_EREQ .
The resulting state is
.BR MXS_ENABLED .
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR MX_ENABLE_REQ (7).
