.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is on
.B M_PROTO
message block.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_cont_test_ind {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_CONT_TEST_IND */
    ulong cc_call_ref;          /* call reference */
    ulong cc_addr_length;       /* address length */
    ulong cc_addr_offset;       /* address offset */
} CC_cont_test_ind_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This message confirms to the testing CCS user that a loop back device has been
(or will be) installed on the specified call control address (circuit).  Upon
receiving this message, the testing CCS user should connect tone generation
and detection equipment to the specified circuit, perform the continuity test
and issue a report using the
.BR CC_CONT_REPORT_REQ (7)
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.PP
This primitive will only be issued to streams successfully bound with the
.BR CC_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive with a non-zero number of setup indications and the
.B CC_TEST
bind flag set.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_CONT_TEST_IND .
.TP
.I cc_call_ref
Indicates the call reference associated with the continuity check call for the
specified call control address (circuit identifier).
.TP
.I cc_addr_length
Indicates the length of the call control address (signalling interface and
circuit identifier) upon which a continuity check is confirmed.  The semantics
of the values in the
.BR CC_CONT_TEST_IND (7)
is identical to the values in the
.BR CC_BIND_REQ (7).
.TP
.I cc_addr_offset
Indicates the offset of the connecting address from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.\"
.\"
.\".SS Rules

This primitive is valid in state
.BR CCS_WCON_CREQ .
The new state is
.BR CCS_WAIT_COR .
.\"
.\"
.SS Modes
This primitive is valid only in NNI mode.
.\"
.\"
.SS Originator
This primitive is originated by the CC User.
