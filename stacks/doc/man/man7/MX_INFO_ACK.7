.SH DESCRIPTION
Indicates to the multiplex serivce user requested information concerning the
multiplex service provider associated with the requesting stream and the
attached channels (if any).
.SH PARAMETERS
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I mx_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR MX_INFO_ACK .
.TP
.I mx_addr_length
indicates the length of the channel addresses.
.TP
.I mx_addr_offset
indicates the offset, from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block, of the channel addresses.
.TP
.I mx_parm_length
indicates the length of the channel parameters associated with the channels
attached to the requesting stream.
.TP
.I mx_parm_offset
indicates the offset, from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block, of the channel parameters associated with the channels attached
to the requesting stream.
.TP
.I mx_prov_flags
indicates the provider options flags.  No flags are currently specified.
.TP
.I mx_style
indicates the style of the multiplex.
.I mx_style
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP 12
.B MX_STYLE1
indicates that the stream does not need to perform an attach as described in
.BR MX_ATTACH_REQ (7).
.TP

.B MXI
to which the multiplex service provider conforms.  This version can be one of
the following values:
.RS
.TP 12
.B MX_VERSION_1_0
indicates Version 1.0 of the Multiplex Interface (MXI) Specification.
.TP
.B MX_VERSION
indicates the current version
.RB ( MX_VERSION_1_0 ).
.RE
