.SH NAME
.B CD_MODEM_SIG_IND
\- report modem signals
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
.\"/*
.\" * CD_MODEM_SIG_IND, M_PROTO type
.\" *
.\" * The cd_sigs field reports the current state of the modem signals.
.\" * This message is sent when modem signals change at the hardware
.\" * interface.  Only changes in signals selected by the cd_modem_sig_enb_req_t
.\" * cd_sigs mask will be evaluated for purposes of change detection.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This provider originated primitives indicates the status of a number of modem
lines and signals.  This primitive is issued in response to a change in modem
signals or in response to a
.BR CD_MODEM_SIG_POLL (7)
primitive.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Indicates the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_sigs
Indicates the state of specific modem lines and signals as a bitwise OR of any
of the following flags (when the flag is set, the signal is asserted):
.RS
.TP
.B CD_DTR
Data terminal ready.
.TP
.B CD_RTS
Request to send.
.TP
.B CD_DSR
Data set ready.
.TP
.B CD_DCD
Data carrier detect.
.TP
.B CD_CTS
Clear to send.
.TP
.B CD_RI
Ring indicator.
.RE
.SS State
This primitive can be issued by the CD provider in any state.
