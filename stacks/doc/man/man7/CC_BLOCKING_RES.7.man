.SH NAME
.B CC_BLOCKING_RES
\- circuit management blocking response
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The format is one
.B M_PROTO
message block.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_blocking_res {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_BLOCKING_RES */
    ulong cc_flags;             /* blocking flags */
    ulong cc_addr_length;       /* address length */
    ulong cc_addr_offset;       /* address offset */
} CC_blocking_res_t;
\fR\s+1

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests that the CCS provider respond to the previous blocking
indication.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_BLOCKING_RES .
.TP
.I cc_flags
Specifies options flags for the operation.  (See "Flags" below.)
.TP
.I cc_addr_length
Specifies the length of the call control address (signalling interface and
circuit or circuit group identifiers) upon which local blocking is requested.
.TP
.I cc_addr_offset
Specifies the offset of the call control address(es) from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SS Flags
.PP
The options flags are protocol and provider-specific.  For additional
information, see the specific Addendum.
.\"
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only valid for the previous
.BR CC_BLOCKING_IND (7)
(call control addresses in the
.B CCS_WRES_BLIND
state).  The new blocking state of the previously specified call controla
addresses is the
.B CCS_BLOCKED
state.
.\"
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is only valid for indications for signalling interfaces in the NNI mode.
.\"
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the CC Provider.
.\"
.\"
.SH ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
.PP
The CCS provider should generate one of the following acknowledgments upon
receipt of this primitive:
.HP
.IR Successful :
Successful completion is indicated via the
.BR CC_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.
.HP
.IR Unsuccessful :
Unsuccessful completion is indicated via the
.BR CC_RELEASE_IND "(7) or " CC_RESET_IND
primitive.
.bu
.IR "Non-fatal errors" :
Errors are indicated via the
.BR CC_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The applicable non-fatal errors are defined as follows:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.RB [ CCACCESS ]
The user did not have sufficient permission to invoke the operation.
.TP
.RB [ CCOUSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ CCSYSERR ]
A system error occurred and the UNIX system error is indicated in the
.BR CC_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
