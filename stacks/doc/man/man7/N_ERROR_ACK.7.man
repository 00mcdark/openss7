.SH NAME
.BR N_ERROR_ACK " (" N_error_ack_t )
\- error acknowledgement
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the NS user that a non-fatal error has occurred in
the last network-user-originated primitive.  This may only be initiated as an
acknowledgment for those primitives that require one.  It also indicates to the
user that no action was taken on the primitive that caused the error.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of the message is one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block, and its structure is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;            /* always N_ERROR_ACK */
    ulong ERROR_prim;           /* primitive in error */
    ulong NPI_error;            /* NPI error code */
    ulong UNIX_error;           /* Linux system error code */
} N_error_ack_t;
\fR\s+1

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Identifies the primitive type.

.TP
.I ERROR_prim
Identifies the primitive type that caused the error.

.TP
.I NPI_error
Contains the Network Provider Interface error code.

.TP
.I UNIX_error
Contains the Linux system error code.  This may only be non-zero if the
.I NPI_error
is equal to
.BR NSYSERR .
.SH ERRORS
The following error codes are allowed to be returned:
.TP
.RB [ NBADADDR ]
The network address as specified in the primitive was in an incorrect format,
or the address contained illegal information.
.TP
.RB [ NBADOPT ]
The options values as specified in the primitive were in an incorrect format,
or they contained illegal information.
.TP
.RB [ NBADQOSPARAM ]
The QOS values specified are outside the range supported by the NS provider.
illegal.
.TP
.RB [ NBADQOSTYPE ]
The QOS structure type is not supported by the NS provider.
.TP
.RB [ NBADTOKEN ]
Token used is not associated with an open stream.
.TP
.RB [ NNOADDR ]
The NS provider could not allocate an address.
.TP
.RB [ NACCESS ]
The user did not have proper permissions.
.TP
.RB [ NOUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ NBADSEQ ]
The sequence number specified in the primitive was incorrect or illegal.
.TP
.RB [ NBADFLAG ]
The flags specified in the primitive were incorrect or illegal.
.TP
.RB [ NBADDATA ]
The amount of user data specified was outside the range supported by the NS
provider.
.TP
.RB [ NSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in the
primitive.
.TP
.RB [ NNOTSUPPORT ]
Specified primitive type is not known to the NS provider.
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in all states that have a pending acknowledgment or
confirmation.
.SH "NEW STATE"
The new state is the same as the one from which the acknowledged request or
response was issued.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Network Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
