.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_UNI_IND
\- Unidirectional Indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks where each
.BR M_DATA (9)
message block contains at least one byte of data.  The format of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TR_uni_ind {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_UNI_REQ */
    ulong DEST_length;        /* Destination address length */
    ulong DEST_offset;        /* Destination address offset */
    ulong ORIG_length;        /* Originating address length */
    ulong ORIG_offset;        /* Originating address offset */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* Options structure length */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* Options structure offset */
} TR_uni_ind_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the transaction user that transaction unit data has been received from
the specified source address.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
Always
.BR TR_UNI_IND .
.TP
.I DEST_length
is the length of the destination address.
.TP
.I DEST_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block) where the destination address begins. 
.TP
.I ORIG_length
is the length of the originating address.
.TP
.I ORIG_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block) where the originating address begins. 
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the requested options associated with the primitive.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block) of the requested options associated with the primitive. 
.PP
The proper alignment of the destination address, originating address and options in the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is not guaranteed. 
.SH MODES
