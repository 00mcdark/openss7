.SH NAME
.PP
.B TR_UNBIND_REQ
\- Unbind Protocol Address Request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of a
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TR_unbind_req {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_UNBIND_REQ */
} TR_unbind_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests that the transaction provider unbind the protocol address associated with
the
.I stream
and deactivate the
.IR stream .
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
indicates the primitive type.
Always
.BR TR_UNBIND_REQ .
.SH RULES
.PP
This primitive requires the transaction provider to generate the following acknowledgments on
receipt of the primitive and that the transaction user must wait for the acknowledgment before
issuing any other primitives:
.SS Successful
Correct acknowledgment of the primitive is indicated via the
.BR TR_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SS Non-fatal errors
These errors will be indicated via the
.BR TR_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.RB [ TROUTSTATE ]
The primitive would place the transaction interface out of state.
.TP
.RB [ TRSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the Linux System error is indicated in the primitive.
