.TH TR_ADDR_REQ 7 "$Date: 2004/10/24 11:47:38 $" "$Name:  $" "Transaction Interface (TRI)"
.SH NAME
.B TR_ADDR_REQ
\- Get Protocol Address Request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consists of a
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TR_addr_req {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_ADDR_REQ */
    ulong TRANS_id;           /* Transaction id */
} TR_addr_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive requests the transaction provider to return the local and
remote protocol addresses currently associated with the transaction
endpoint.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
specifies the primitive type.  Always
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ .
.TP
.I TRANS_id
specifies the transaction association identifier for which address service is requested.  If address
service is requested for local bind address, then the transaction identifier must be -1.
.PP
Note that the
.BR TR_ADDR_REQ
and
.BR TR_ADDR_ACK (7)
primitives have no effect on the
state of the transaction provider and do not appear in the state tables. 
.SH RULES
This primitive requires the transaction provider to generate one of the
following acknowledgments on receipt of the primitive and that the transaction
user wait for the acknowledgment before issuing any other primitives:
.TP
.B Successful
Acknowledgment of the primitive via
.BR TR_ADDR_ACK (7).
.TP
.B Non-fatal errors
These errors will be indicated via
.BR TR_ERROR_ACK (7).
.SH MODES
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transaction user.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR tri (7),
.BR M_PCPROTO (9),
.BR TR_ADDR_ACK (7),
.BR TR_ERROR_ACK (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transaction Interface first appeared in OpenSS7.
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
This interface conforms to TRI Revision 0.9.2, Draft 1.
