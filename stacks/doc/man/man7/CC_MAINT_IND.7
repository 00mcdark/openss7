.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by zero or
more
.B M_DATA
blocks.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct CC_maint_ind {
    ulong cc_primitive;         /* always CC_MAINT_IND */
    ulong cc_reason;            /* reason for indication */
    ulong cc_call_ref;          /* call reference */
    ulong cc_addr_length;       /* length of address */
    ulong cc_addr_offset;       /* length of address */
} CC_maint_ind_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates that the CCS provider has observed an event on the
indicated call control address(es) which requires a maintenance action.
.\"
.\"
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.\"
.\"
.TP 16
.I cc_primitive
indicates the primitive type.  Always
.BR CC_MAINT_IND .
.TP
.I cc_reason
Indicates the reason for the maintenance indication.  Maintenance indication
reasons are protocol and provider-specific.  For additional information see
the Addendum.
.TP
.I cc_call_ref
Indicates the call reference.  The call reference is used by the CCS provider
to identify the call.
.TP
.I cc_addr_length
Indicates the length of the call control address(es) (signalling interface and
circuit identifiers) upon which the CCS provider is giving a maintenance
indication.
.TP
.I cc_addr_offset
Indicates the offset of the call control address(es) from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
