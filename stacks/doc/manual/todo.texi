Things to do (there is a great long list of these, but here is a crack
at the first ones):

@itemize @minus
@item
Compile entire (private) package against Linux Fast-STREAMS.

@item
Convert test programs into conformance test suites under GNU autotest.  This should be straight
forward matter.

@item
Start retesting SIGTRAN components against SCTP and Linux Fast-STREAMS starting with M2PA.

@item
Start retesting SS7 Device Drivers under Linux Fast-STREAMS starting with X400P.

@item
Start retesting SS7 Stack components (MTP2, MTP3, SCCP, ISUP, TCAP) under Linux Fast-STREAMS.

@item
Package a public release.  It has been way too long since a public release of this package.
The package has almost a million lines of code in it, most of which the public has never seen!

@item
Complete the SL-MUX driver and utility programs.

@item
Complete the libslpcap library (@manpage{pcap(3)}) for live capture of SS7 link SDUs using
@manpage{ethereal(1)} or @manpage{wireshark(1)}.
