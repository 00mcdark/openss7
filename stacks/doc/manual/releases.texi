This is the OpenSS7 Release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, drivers and modules
used with the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} or @cite{Linux STREAMS} SVR 4.2 STREAMS utility for Linux.
The purpose of providing a separate release of this package was to separate the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, headers, drivers and modules from the @cite{Linux STREAMS} package for
use with both @cite{Linux STREAMS} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} in preparation for replacement of
the former by the later.

The following sections provide information on @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} releases as well as
compatibility information of OpenSS7 release to the original GCOM releases of these modules and
drivers, as well as Linux kernel compatibility.

@node Prerequisites
@section Prerequisites

Prerequisites for the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package are as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item A fairly LSB compliant GNU/Linux distribution.
@footnote{@xref{GNU/Linux Distributions}, for more information.}
@item Linux 2.4 or 2.6 kernel (2.4.10 - 2.4.27) or (2.6.3 - 2.6.10)
@item glibc2 or better.
@item GNU info (for info files).
@item GNU groff (for man pages).
@footnote{If you are using a Debian release, please make sure to install the groff extension package
(@samp{groff_ext}), as it contains the @command{refer} or @command{grefer} commands necessary for
including references in the manual pages.}

When installing from the tarball (@pxref{Installing the Tar Ball}), this distribution is probably
compatible with a  much broader array of distributions than those listed above.  These are the
distributions against which the current maintainer creates builds.

@node Linux Kernel
@subsection Kernel
@cindex Kernel

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} compiles as a @dfn{Linux} kernel module.  It is not ncessary to patch the
@dfn{Linux} kernel to use the package.  At a later date, it is possible to move this package into the
kernel.

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} is compatible with 2.4 kernel series after 2.4.10.  It has been tested
up to and including 2.6.10.

@section Bugs
@cindex bugs

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} has many known bugs.  These are alpha releases.  Use at your own risk.
Remember that there is @b{NO WARRANTY}.@footnote{See section @b{NO WARRANY} under @ref{Copying}.}

@b{This software is @i{alpha} software.  As such, it will likely crash your kernel.  Installation
of the software may irreparably mangle your header files or Linux distribution in such a way as to
make it unusable.  Crashes will likely lock your system and rebooting the system might not repair the
problem.  You can loose all the data on your system.  Because this software can crash your kernel,
the resulting unstable system could destroy computer hardware or peripherals making them unusable.
You will likely void the warranty on any system on which you run this software. YOU HAVE BEEN
WARNED.}
