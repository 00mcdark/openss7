This is the OpenSS7 Release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, drivers and
modules used with the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} or @cite{Linux STREAMS} SVR
4.2 STREAMS utility for Linux.  The purpose of providing a separate release of
this package was to separate the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, headers, drivers
and modules from the @cite{Linux STREAMS} package for use with both @cite{Linux
STREAMS} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} in preparation for replacement of the
former by the later.

The following sections provide information on @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} releases as
well as compatibility information of OpenSS7 release to the original GCOM
releases of these modules and drivers, as well as Linux kernel compatibility.
