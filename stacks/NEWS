The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package.

 Major changes for release strss7-0.9a.5
----------------------------------------

The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package contains a wide array of SS7, SIGTRAN,
ISDN and VoIP drivers and components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  This is
the public release package which has most of the components removed.
Subscribers and sponsors of the OpenSS7 Project have access to the full
array of components.

This is the fifth release of the OpenSS7 SS7 Stack strss7 package that
contains SS7 (Signalling System No. 7), SIGTRAN (SIGnalling TRANsport),
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and VoIP (Void over Internet
Protocol) signalling stack components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The
package contains the necessary header files, manual pages and other
documentation for SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP components in a separate
autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support recent compilers, kernels and
distributions.

   * The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

   * Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automagically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   * Added versioning of all library symbols.

   * Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   * Dropped support for `LiS'.

   * Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.

   * Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   * Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosynchratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   * Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   * Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   * Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     enivironment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   * Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

 Major changes for release strss7-0.9a-4
----------------------------------------

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

   * Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to
     support 32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.
     Binary compatibilty should not have been disrupted.  At the same
     time as the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of
     the IO controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

   * Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

   * Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs
     on x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc
     4.0.2 compiler warnings.

   * Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
     mailing list.

   * Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
     Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
     N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

   * Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibilty over 64-bit on
     x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

This is a public alpha release of the package.

 Major changes for release strss7-0.9a-3
----------------------------------------

This is primarily a bug fixes release and corrections resulting from
testing.  This is a major bug fix release.  The previous release was
largely untested.  This release has been verified (conformance test
suite passes) for operation with `Linux Fast-STREAMS'
(`streams-0.7a.4').

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
`RPM' release numbers will be `-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)' and all `Debian'
release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches and
relelease the package, please bump up the release number and apply a
suitable release suffix for your organization.  We leave `Debian'
release number `_1' reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the
source in the `.dsc' file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
distribution support.  The package also supports both `LiS-2.18.1' as
well as `streams-0.7a' on both kernels.

Not publicly released.

 Major changes for release strss7-0.9a-2
----------------------------------------

Not publicly released.

 Initial release strss7-0.9a-1
------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strss7' release.

Not publicly released.
