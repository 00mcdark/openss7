Things to do (there is a great long list of these, but here is a crack
at the first ones):

   - Compile entire (private) package against Linux Fast-STREAMS.

   - Convert test programs into conformance test suites under GNU
     autotest.  This should be straight forward matter.

   - Start retesting SIGTRAN components against SCTP and Linux
     Fast-STREAMS starting with M2PA.

   - Start retesting SS7 Device Drivers under Linux Fast-STREAMS
     starting with X400P.

   - Start retesting SS7 Stack compontents (MTP2, MTP3, SCCP, ISUP,
     TCAP) under Linux Fast-STREAMS.

   - Package a public release.  It has been wayyy tooo looong since a
     public release of this package.  The package has almost a million
     lines of code in it, most of which the public has never seen!
