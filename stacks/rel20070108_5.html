The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package contains a wide array of SS7, SIGTRAN, ISDN and VoIP drivers and
components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  This is the public release package which has most of the
components removed.  Subscribers and sponsors of the OpenSS7 Project have access to the full array
of components.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This is the fifth release of the OpenSS7 SS7 Stack strss7 package that contains SS7 (Signalling
System No. 7), SIGTRAN (SIGnalling TRANsport), ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and VoIP
(Void over Internet Protocol) signalling stack components for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The package
contains the necessary header files, manual pages and other documentation for SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP
components in a separate autoconf tarball.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is primarily to support recent compilers, kernels and distributions, and to upgrade the
X400P-SS7 driver with support for the Varion V401P (Tormenta III) cards.  Also, this is the first
release that has ISDN, SIGTRAN and VoIP components moved to separate packages (but will still build
all components).
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>The X400P-SS7 driver has been upgraded to support the Varion V401P (Tormenta III) card.  This
driver passes all validation test suites and is production grade.  The driver still supports the
older cards.  Also, an autoconf style validation test suite was added and the test-x400p test case
executable upgraded.</li>
<li>Additional features supported in all packages (see master package release notes).</li>
<!--
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new - -with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added - -disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9a.5 of the OpenSS7 SS7/SIGTRAN/ISDN/VoIP <em>strss7</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 SS7 Stack package includes a wide array of kernel modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers,
modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the
development and execution of Signalling System Number 7 (SS7), Signalling Transport (SIGTRAN),
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Voice over IP (VoIP) protocol stack components and
applications for the Linux Fast-STREAMS environment.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
However, the current package has had ISDN components moved to the `strisdn' package, SIGTRAN
components moved to the `sigtran' package, and VoIP components moved to the `strvoip' package.  Only
SS7 components remain in the `strss7' package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
