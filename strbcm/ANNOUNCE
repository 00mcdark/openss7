strbcm-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 on August 23, 2006.

STREAMS BCM is an implementation of STREAMS Binary Compatibility Modules
for Linux Fast-STREAMS and provides compatibility for Linux with all
major UNIX implementations of STREAMS.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's first separate release from the OpenSS7
Project of the OpenSS7 STREAMS Binary Compatiblity Modules.  This BCM
package provides compatibility with:

* AIX
* etc.

This release is the initial public release.

This is public alpha release of the package: it deprecates previous
releases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strbcm package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strbcm_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.
