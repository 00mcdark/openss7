This is the OpenSS7 Release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, drivers and modules
used with the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} or
@cite{Linux STREAMS}@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use
it.} SVR 4.2 STREAMS releases.

The purpose of providing a separate release of this package was to separate the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, headers, drivers and modules from the @cite{Linux
STREAMS}@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use it.}
package for use with both @cite{Linux STREAMS}@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported
and deprecated.  Do not use it.} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} in preparation for replacement of the
former by the later.

The following sections provide information on @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} releases as well as
compatibility information of OpenSS7 release to mainstream UNIX releases of the core, modules and
drivers, as well as Linux kernel compatibility.

@node Pre-Alpha Releases
@subsection Pre-Alpha Releases

@dfn{Pre-alpha} releases are releases that have received no testing whatsoever.  Code in the release
is not even known to configure or compile.  The purpose of a pre-alpha release is to make code and
documenation available for insepection only, and to solicit comments on the design approach or other
characteristics of the software package.

@dfn{Pre-alpha} release packages ship containing warnings recommending that the user not even
execute the contained code.

@node Alpha Releases
@subsection Alpha Releases

@dfn{Alpha} release are releases that have received little to no testing, or that have been tested
and contains known bugs or defects that make the package unsuitable even for testing.  The purpose
for an @dfn{alpha} release are the same as for the pre-alpha release, with the additional purpose
that it is an earily release of partially functional code that has problems that an external
developer might be willing to fix themselves and contribute back to the project.

@dfn{Alpha} release packages ship containing warnings that executing the code can crash machines and
might possibly do damage to systems upon which it is executed.

@node Beta Releases
@subsection Beta Releases

@dfn{Beta} releases are releases that have received some testing, but the testing to date is not
exhaustive.  @dfn{Beta} release packages do not ship with known defects.  All known defects are
resolved before distribution; however, as exhaustive testing has not been performed, unknown
defects may exist.  The purpose for a @dfn{beta} release is to provide a baseline for other
organizations to participate in the rigorous testing of the package.

@dfn{Beta} release packages ship containing warnings that the package has not been exhaustively
tested and that the package may cause systems to crash.  Suitability of software in this category
for production use is not advised by the project; however, as always, is at the discretion of the
user of the software.

@node Gamma Releases
@subsection Gamma Releases

@dfn{Gamma} release are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project, but
external testing has been minimal.  @dfn{Gamma} release packages do not ship with known defects.  As
exhaustive internal testing has been performed, unknown defects should be few.  Please remember that
there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Gamma} release packages typically resolve problems in previous @dfn{beta} releases, and might
not have had full regression testing performed.  Suitability of software in this category for
production use is at the discretion of the user of the software.   @dfn{The OpenSS7 Project}
recommends that the complete validation test suites provided with the package be performed and pass
on target systems before considering production use.

@node Production Releases
@subsection Production Releases

@dfn{Production} releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project and
validated on specific distributions and architectures.  @dfn{Production} release packages do not
ship with known defects.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Production} packages ship containig a list of validated distributions and architecutres.
Full regression testing of any maintenance changes is performed.  Suitability of software in this
category for production use on the specified target distributions and architectures is at the
discretion of the user.  It should not be necessary to preform validation tests on the set of
supported target systems before considering production use.

@node Unstable Releases
@subsection Unstable Releases

@dfn{Unstable} releases are releases that have received extensive testing within the project and
validated on a a wide range of distributions and architectures; however, is has tested unstable and
found to be suffering from critical problems and issues that cannot be resolved.  Maintenance of the
package has proven impossible.  @dfn{Unstable} release packages ship with known defects (and loud
warnings).  Suitability of software in this category for production use is at the discretion of the
user of the software.  @dfn{The OpenSS7 Project} recommends that the problems and issues be closely
examined before this software is used even in a non-production evironment.  Each failing test
scenario should be completely avoided by the application.  @cite{OpenSS7} beta software is more
stable that software in this category.
