@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the @command{@value{PACKAGE}} release.

This is the initial release of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package for @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}.  The ability to include precompiled STREAMS binaries was formerly part of the
@cite{Linux STREAMS} package, however, as the ability is also applicable to @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}, it was removed into a separate package.  Once @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} is production
grade, this binary compatibility suite will be rolled back into the streams package as @cite{LiS} is
deprecated.
