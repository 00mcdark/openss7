The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Binary Compatibility Modules package.

 Major changes for release strbcm-0.9.2.2.rc3
---------------------------------------------

   * Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   * Dropped support for `LiS'.

   * Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.

   * This release candidate provides support for additional `SuSE'
     distributions on `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution
     support includes `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10',
     `SuSE 10.1'.

   * Added `--enable-devel' `configure' option for embedded targets.

   * Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

 Initial release strbcm-0.9.2.1
-------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strbcm' release.

This is the initial release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS Binary
Compatibility Modules' package for `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.  The ability
to include precompiled STREAMS binaries was formerly part of the `Linux
STREAMS' package, however, as the ability is also applicable to `Linux
Fast-STREAMS', it was removed into a separate package.  Once `Linux
Fast-STREAMS' is production grade, this binary compatibility suite will
be rolled back into the streams package as `LiS' is deprecated.
