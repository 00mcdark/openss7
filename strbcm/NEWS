The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Binary Compatibility Modules package.

 Major changes for release strbcm-0.9.2.2
-----------------------------------------

   * Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   * Added versioning of all library symbols.

   * Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   * Dropped support for `LiS'.

   * Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.

   * Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   * Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   * Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   * Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   * Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

 Initial release strbcm-0.9.2.1
-------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strbcm' release.

This is the initial release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS Binary
Compatibility Modules' package for `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.  The ability
to include pre-compiled STREAMS binaries was formerly part of the
`Linux STREAMS' package, however, as the ability is also applicable to
`Linux Fast-STREAMS', it was removed into a separate package.  Once
`Linux Fast-STREAMS' is production grade, this binary compatibility
suite will be rolled back into the streams package as `LiS' is
deprecated.
