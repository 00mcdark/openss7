@chapter Development
@cindex developing

@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} provides all of the header files, shared object and static libraries,
manual pages and documentation necessary for the development of both user space applications
programs and kernel space @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers based on the package.  The sections that
follow describe these development facilities.

@menu
* Development Header Files::
* Static and Shared Libraries::
* Kernel Module Development::
* Manual Pages::
@end menu

@node Development Header Files::
@section Header Files

Header files are installed, typically, in the @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}/} subdirectory.  To
use the header files from the package, @samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} must be included in the
@command{gcc} command line as a preprocessor option.

In general, @samp{-I} include preprocessor directives on the @command{gcc} command line should be
ordered in the reverse order of the dependencies between packages.  So, for example, if the include
files from all add-on packages are required, the order of these directives would be:
@samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strxns}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strcompat}
@samp{-I/usr/include/streams}.

Following are the user visible header files provided by the @file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}}
package in the directory @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}:

@table @file


@end table

@subsection User Space Programs

Typical include files for interacting with Transport providers from user space include the
@file{xti.h} header file.  Additional header files for interacting with specific drivers or modules
may also be required.  The @cite{xti.h} header file is for interacting with the XTI library.

@subsection Kernel Space Drivers and Modules

Typical include files for writing @dfn{STREAMS} module and drivers implementing transport providers
in kernels space include @cite{xti.h} and @cite{xti_sctp.h}.  The header files provide access to
definitions for the TPI interface and additional XTI definitions for use by @dfn{STREAMS} drivers
and modules.  Additional header files for interacting with specific drivers or modules may also be
required.

Aside from including this header files, the general procedures for compiling @dfn{STREAMS} modules
and drivers also apply to @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers written to the Transport Provider
Interface.

@node Static and Shared Libraries
@section Libraries

Shared or static version of the @cite{libxnet} library may be linked when using the
@file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package.@footnote{Note that the @file{libxnet} library is
now provided by the @file{strxnet-@value{VERSION_STRXNET}} package.} The library may either be
specified on the @command{gcc} command line as a shared library (e.g. @samp{-lxnet}) or as a static
library (e.g.  @samp{/usr/lib/libxnet.a}).

If the shared object library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command
line:

@table @samp

@item -lxnet
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libxnet.so} shared library.

@end table

If the static library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command line:

@table @samp

@item /usr/lib/libxnet.a
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libxnet.a} static library.

@end table

@node Kernel Module Development
@section Kernel Modules

Developing TPI kernel modules is similar to user space programs with regard to header files.
@file{/usr/include/strxnet} should be placed as an include directory to search on the @command{gcc}
command line.  The rules for compiling @cite{Linux} kernel modules and the rules for compiling
@dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers should be followed.  In particular, several important intricacies
should be considered:

@itemize @bullet

@item The @command{gcc} compiler used to compile the kernel modules must be the same version of
compiler that was used to compile the kernel and @dfn{STREAMS} base package.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must have the same compile flags that were used to compile the
kernel and @dfn{STREAMS} base package.  @command{kbuild} can be used to accomplish this.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must define several important kernel defines including
@samp{-DLINUX}, @samp{-D__KERNEL__}, as well as the base name of the module.  Again, @command{kbuild}
can be used to accomplish this.

@item The @command{gcc} command line must include several important files directly on the command
line, such as, @samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-autoconf.h} and
@samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-modversions.h}.@footnote{The
kernel version, @samp{@value{_kversion}}, is just an example.  For the running kernel, use the
output of @samp{uname -r}.}

@node Conformance
@chapter Conformance
@cindex conformance

Although @cite{OpenSS7 Project} software is of high quality, and untested behaviour is often correct
behaviour, the principle of the @cite{OpenSS7 Project} is to test all functional requirements
against the behaviour of the package in a repeatable validation test suite that can be used to
perform regression, target architecture validation and trouble shooting, (@pxrefman{Maturity}, and
@pxrefman{Test Suites}).
