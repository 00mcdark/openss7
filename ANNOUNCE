openss7-0.9.2.C was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

The OpenSS7 Master Package is a single autoconf/RPM tarball that
contains all of the other OpenSS7 packages in a single build
environment.  It is primarily used by the maintainers of the OpenSS7
packaes during development.

This is the third OpenSS7 Master Package release for Linux Fast STREAMS.
The OpenSS7 Master Package contains all of the OpenSS7 release packages
in a single autoconf tarball.  Unfortunately the strss7 component in
this package is also stripped for public release.

 This is a public alpha release of the package.

 Please see README-alpha in the release, or
 <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/openss7-0.9.2.C/README-alpha>.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the openss7 package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/openss7_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/openss7-0.9.2.C/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/openss7-0.9.2.C/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the openss7.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/openss7_manual.html>).
