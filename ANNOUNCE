Subject: openss7 0.9.2.D Released - OpenSS7 Master Package

Package openss7-0.9.2.D was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

This is the OpenSS7 Master Package package.  It consists of a master
package that contains all other OpenSS7 Project package releases.  Use
this package if you are interested in ease of installation of a wide
range of OpenSS7 Project packages.

The OpenSS7 Master Package package contains:

  sctp-0.2.24 (Linux Native Sockets SCTP),
  iperf-2.0.5 (Internet Performance),
  streams-0.9.2.1 (Linux Fast-STREAMS),
  strcompat-0.9.2.4 (STREAMS Compatibility Modules),
  strutil-0.9.2.4 (STREAMS Utilities),
  strbcm-0.9.2.2 (STREAMS Binary Compatibility Module),
  strtty-0.9.2.1 (STREAMS Terminals),
  strxns-0.9.2.4 (STREAMS X/Open Networking Services),
  strxnet-0.9.2.9 (STREAMS X/Open Networking),
  strsock-0.9.2.1 (STREAMS Sockets),
  strinet-0.9.2.4 (STREAMS Internet),
  strsctp-0.9.2.6 (STREAMS SCTP),
  striso-0.9.2.1 (STREAMS Open Systems Interconnect),
  netperf-2.3.4 (Network Performance),
  strchan-0.9.2.1 (STREAMS Channels),
  strisdn-0.9.2.1 (STREAMS ISDN Stack),
  strss7-0.9a.5 (STREAMS SS7 Stacks),
  sigtran-0.9.2.1 (STREAMS SIGTRAN Stack),
  strvoip-0.9.2.1 (STREAMS VoIP Stacks) and
  LiS-2.18.4 (Linux STREAMS).

If you need to build an install a significant number of these packages,
the OpenSS7 Master Package package is the easiest way to do so.

This is the fourth public release of the OpenSS7 Master Package.  The
sub-packages have been reorganized for this release.  See README in the
release for a sub-package listing.  Aside from sub-package
reorganization, the major difference from previous release is that this
release no longer contains LiS.  Too many of the sub-packages will not
even build against LiS because of its Stream head deficiencies.

Most of the sub-packages in the release are production grade for Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  All existing validation test suites run clean on
supported distributions and architectures.  The packages build better
Debian/Ubuntu .deb files.

It is unlikely that the OpenSS7 Master Package will be released as
frequently as before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To
rebuild the master package with a new sub-package release, simply
replace the directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked
sub-package release and then rebuild the master package.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):

         - strnsl-0.9.2.1
         - strbcm-0.9.2.2
         - striso-0.9.2.1
         - strsock-0.9.2.1
         - strtty-0.9.2.1
         - strutil-0.9.2.4

   - Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   - This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp
     drivers at the 2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British
     Columbia.  This version was interoperability tested with all
     implementations present.

   - Better support for Ubuntu and recent `gcc' compilers, including
     debian script corrections.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versioning of all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     `streams' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels:  LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SuSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improvide compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic beahviour for some
     distributions (primarily SuSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to supress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - Each package will not build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     `make doxy' target.  See `make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.


_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs,
see the openss7 package page (http://www.openss7.org/openss7_pkg.html).

See `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/openss7-0.9.2.D/ChangeLog' and
`http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/openss7-0.9.2.D/NEWS' in the release
for more information.  Also, see the `openss7.pdf' manual in the
release (also in html `http://www.openss7.org/openss7_manual.html').

 - strvoip-0.9.2.2 (STREAMS VoIP Stacks),
 - osr61-0.9.2.1 (Dialogic Open System Release 6.1) and
 - LiS-2.18.5 (Linux STREAMS).

If you need to build an install a significant number of these packages,
the OpenSS7 Master Package package is the easiest way to do so.

This is the fourth public release of the OpenSS7 Master Package.  See
README in the release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the

All existing validation test suites run clean on supported distributions
and architectures.

It is unlikely that the OpenSS7 Master Package will be released as

rebuild the master package with a new sub-package release, simply
replace the directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked
sub-package release and then rebuild the master package.  This release
provides support for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

    - Addition of the osr61 sub-package that contains Dialogic Open
      System Release 6.1 version 239 GPL drivers.

    - A few minor corrections to the common build process.

    - Support for autoconf 2.61 and gettext 0.16.

    - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kernels.

    - The package now looks for subpackages with a version number as
      unpacked by separate tarball.

This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
