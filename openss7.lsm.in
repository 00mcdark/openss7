			OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS and SS7/ISDN/VoIP/SIGTRAN 
			Protocol Stacks.
			@PACKAGE@ provides a fully SVR 4.2 MP compatible 
			STREAMS implementation called Linux Fast-STREAMS as 
			well as a collection of STREAMS protocol stacks for 
			IP, OSI and SS7.
			This distribution is currently applicable to Linux 2.4, 
			2.6 and 3.x kernels and was targetted at ix86, x86_64, 
			ppc and ppc64 architectures, but should build and 
			install for other architectures as well.
			Supports a wide range of new and old Linux 
			distributions and production kernels without kernel 
			patching.
