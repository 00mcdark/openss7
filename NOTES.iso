Ethernet Types:
---------------

- 0x00FE shown in RFC 1701 (GRE) for OSI Network Layer, but it
  conflicts with the 802.3 length field.  RFC 1700 shows this
  as the LSAP for ISO CLNS IS 8473, but it is really for the whole
  network layer using ISO/IEC TR 9577 encapsulation

- 0x0800 is IPv4.

- 0x0801 is X.75 Internet
- 0x0805 is X.25 Level 3 (PLP?). (Likely ISO 8881: X.25 for use on LANs)
- 0x0806 is ARP

LLC LSAPS
---------

- 0x7E ISO/IEC 8208 (X.25 PLP over LLC2)
- 0xFE ISO/TR 9577 NLP ID PDUs

ISO/TR 9577 (X.263) NLPIDs
--------------------------

- 00000011 - 0x03 ITU-T Rec. X.633 (network layer fast-byte protocol)

- 00001000 - 0x08 Q.931, Q.932, Q.933, X.36, ISO/IEC 11572, ISO/IEC 11582
- 00001001 - 0x09 Q.2931

- 00110010 - 0x32 X.45
- 0011xxxx - ---- X.25 LLC2 (ISO/IEC 8208 - GFI Extension, except 0x32)
- 01000100 - 0x44 G.764 (PVP)

- 10000000 - 0x80 IEEE SNAP
- 10000001 - 0x81 CLNL  (ISO/IEC 8473-1 | X.233) (active subset)
- 10000010 - 0x82 ES-IS (ISO 9542)

- 10001011 - 0x8B X.273 (ISO/IEC 11577) (NLS)

- 10110000 - 0xC0 FRF.9
- 10110001 - 0xC1 FRF.12
- 10110010 - 0xC2 FRF OA&M
- 10110011 - 0xC3 FRF.priv

- 10001110 - 0x8E IPv6  (RFC 2460)
- 11001100 - 0xCC IPv4  (RFC 0791)
- 11001111 - 0xCF PPP   (RFC 1548)

Note that CLNL packets are self identifying: that is, they identify
whether they are CLNP, ES-IS or IS-IS packets.

It looks like 8208 packets are placing the X.25 address field directly
into the NLP-ID or some such.


IP Multicast Addresses:
-----------------------

- 224.0.0.1  All Systems on this subnet.		(RFC1112)
- 224.0.0.2  All Routers on this subnet.		(RFC1112)
- 224.0.0.3  Unassigned

- 224.0.0.21 IPAllIntermediateSystems (IS-IS)		(RFC1142)


IP Protocol Numbers:
--------------------

- Protocol Number 29 'ISO-TP4' is assigned by IANA for ISO Transport
  Protocol Class 4 for RFC905 (Marshal T. Rose).  (Linux /etc/protocols
  notes that this is ISO Transport Protocol Class 4.)  RFC905 is just a
  copy of a draft of X.224 | ISO/IEC 8073 (COTS).  I suppose this is ISO
  TP4 directly over IP without CLNS, but I cannot find a reference to
  this.

- Protocol Number 80 'ISO-IP' is assigned by IANA for ISO Internet
  Protocol (Marshall T. Rose). (Linux /etc/protocols lists this with no
  notes.)  There is no RFC reference.  I suppose this is CLNS over IP.
  (Actually, there is a direct reference by Marshall in RFC 1070 for
  this protocol number.)

  This protocol can use 224.0.0.1 with the SNAcP defined in RFC 1070.

- Protocol Number 124 'ISIS over IPv4' is assigned by IANA. (Linux
  /etc/protocols lists this with no notes.)  There is no RFC reference.

TCP/UDP/SCTP Port Numbers:
--------------------------

Well Known Port Numbers:

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 102 'iso-tsap' is assigned by IANA for
  ISO-TSAP Class 0 (Marshall T. Rose)  (Linux /etc/services notes that
  this port is used for ISODE.)  (I think that this is TP0 over TCP as 
  described by Marshall in RFC 1006 (ISOT).) (RFC 983, RFC 1006, RFC
  2126.)

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 146 'iso-tp0' is assigned by IANA for ISO-IP0
  (Marshall T. Rose) (not listed in /etc/services)  (Mentioned directly
  by Marshall in RFC 1086, "ISO-TP0 bridge between TCP and X25," for
  TCP.)

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 147 'iso-ip' is assigned by IANA for ISO-IP
  (Marshall T. Rose) (not listed in /etc/services) (Mentioned directly
  by Marshall in RFC 1070 for UDP.)

  This protocol can use 224.0.0.1 with the SNAcP defined in RFC 1070.

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 163 'cmip-man' is assigned by IANA for
  CMIP/TCP Manager (Mashall T. Rose).  (Linux /etc/services notes that
  this port is used for ISO Management over IP (CMOT)).  This is
  definitely RFC 1095, which is now "Historical".

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 164 'cmip-agent' is assigned by IANA for
  CMIP/TCP Agent (Mashall T. Rose).  (Linux /etc/services notes that
  this port is used for ISO Management over IP (CMOT)).  This is
  definitely RFC 1095, which is now "Historical".

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 399 'iso-tsap-c2' is assigned by IANA for ISO
  Transport Class 2 Non-Control over TCP/UDP (Yannic Pouffary). (not
  listed in /etc/services) (I think this is TP2 over TCP as described by
  Yannic in RFC 2126 (ITOT).)

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 499 'iso-ill' is assigned by IANA for ISO ILL
  Protocol (Mark H. Needleman) (not listed in /etc/services)

Registered Port Numbers:

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 1106 'isoipsigport-1' is assigned by IANA for
  ISOIPSIGPORT-1 (Peter Egli) (not listed in /etc/services)

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 1107 'isoipsigport-2' is assigned by IANA for
  ISOIPSIGPORT-2 (Peter Egli) (not listed in /etc/services)

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 1998 'x25-svs-port' is assigned by IANA for
  Cisco X.25 Service (XOT). (not listed in /etc/services) (Defined in
  RFC 1613.)

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 3782 'iso-tp0s' is assigned by IANA for
  Secure ISO TP0 port (Herbert Falk) (not listed in /etc/services)

- TCP/UDP/SCTP port number 17007 'isode-dua' is assigned by IANA. (not
  listed in /etc/services)  (Probably ISODE DUA-DSA for directory
  services.)

RFC 1142 - OSI IS-IS Intra-domain Routing Protocol (ISO/IEC 10589)
RFC 1070 - Use of the Internet as a Subnetwork for Experimentation with the OSI Network Layer

- RFC 1768 - Multicast NSAPs for CLNS and (ES-IS/IS-IS) extensions

- Typical trick: use

  49                AFI (Local Binary)
  --                IDI (NULL)
  XXXX              Routing Domain/Area Code (Subnetwork)
  HH:HH:HH:HH:HH:HH MAC Address
  00                NSel

Note that ES can automatically configure their addresses by observing
the ISO 9542 IS-Hello packets and using the NET at the NSAP all the way
through the Area Code and appending the 48-bit IEEE MAC address and the
N-selector to form its own address.  This does not depend on the form of
the AFI.

Design Notes:
=============

Tricks for TP4 over CLNS
------------------------

Could use an NPI CLNL driver with a wildcard bind to link underneath the
TP4 CLNS driver.  This NPI driver would register for inet protocol 80
'ISO-IP' and deliver packets based on Internet NSAPs.  The network
address selector would distinguish between CLNS, ESIS and ISIS.  It
could also register a packet handler for IP and filter UDP port 147
ISO-grams.  It could also register for CLNL sap ethernet, 802.2 and
SNAP packets.  If wanrouter was fixed in the Linux kernel, we would also
receive MPOX, MPOFR and MPOA encapsulated packets in addition to MP SNAP
packets.  Performing outgoing packet routing (interface selection) gets
a little tricky.  Another trick would be to register for LLC and HDLC
packets and perform our own de-encapsulation.  The trick here is that
most protocol modules should check for PACKET_HOST before processing the
packet.  If we want to steal a packet, just set the packet type on the
sk_buff to -1 or something.  NITs like pcap(3) will still see the
packet.

Better Idea
-----------

TP can use Linux' device independent packet layer and some wanrouter
magic to do what it needs, at least for CLNS.  Any special devices that
we want to support in the scheme of things can be wrappered to pseudo
network devices under Linux.  This could be acheived by opening a
network stream and linking DLPI streams underneath.  NP streams would
not be linked under the TP, the TP would access them via Linux packet
handling.  Specific X.25 PLP CONS connections could be temporarily
linked underneath the TP driver for use by specific TP2, TP3 or TP4 CONS
streams.  It would require an X.25 PLP CONS packet handler and routing
logic, as Linux doesn't have one of those.

For ISO-IP, no additional packet handler is required as IP routing and
handling can be used instead.  What underlying networking is performed
can be handled by using the TP transport address and selectors reserved
for IP.  Sent packets can use the entire IP subsystem.  Received packets
can be filtered.  CONS over LAN can also be performed easily provided
that there is an X.121 ARP facility, or that TP can hook and provide
one.

Zero copy conversion between sk_buffs and msgbs:
------------------------------------------------

Converting from an sk_buff to a chain of mblks is probably pretty easy.
Use esballoc to allocate a message block for the sk_buff header, map
each page in the page fragment list and esballoc a message block, hiding
the vaddr in the internal data buffer somewhere, and then do the same
for each sk_buff in the frag list.  Each time an mblk is esballoc'ed
take another reference on the original sk_buff with skb_get() (except
for the inital mblk).  When the external buffer databs are freed, each
paged fragment has its vaddr unmapped and a reference released on the
head sk_buff with kfree_skb(), each real memory block simply releases a
reference on the head sk_buff with kfree_skb().  When the last reference
to the head sk_buff is released, the head sk_buff is freed. 

Coversion the other way might be difficult.  The major hurdle is that
the sk_buff saves shared information hidden at the end of the data
buffer.  One possibilty for msgb chains is to allocate a zero-length
sk_buff as a header and then place the data buffer information into the
paged frag list (up to 6 buffers in the chain) and then pull some
portion of the header (say the first fragment).  Then these pages could
be mapped by the user of the sk_buff as required.  An skb->destructor is
set that uses information in the control block.  Another wrinkle is that
the control block is overwritten between layers.  This could be
overcome, I suppose, by placing the sk_buff pointer in the head msblk
(b_prev) and then linking them into a hash table (b_next).  The
destructor could then search this hash and free the corresponding mblk.
