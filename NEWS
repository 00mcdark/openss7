The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 Master Package package.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D
------------------------------------------

This is the fourth public release of the OpenSS7 Master Package.  The
sub-packages have been reorganized for this release.  See `README' in
the release for a sub-package listing.  Aside from sub-package
reorganization, the major difference from previous release is that this
release no longer contains `LiS'.  Too many of the sub-packages will
not even build against `LiS' because of its Stream head deficiencies.

Most of the sub-packages in the release are production grade for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  All existing validation test suites run clean on
supported distributions and architectures.  The packages build better
Debian/Ubuntu .deb files.

It is unlikely that the `OpenSS7 Master Package' will be released as
frequently as before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To
rebuild the master package with a new sub-package release, simply
replace the directory to which the sub-package belongs with the
unpacked sub-package release and then rebuild the master package.

Following are the major changes since the last release candidate:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Added `strnsl-0.9.2.1' package.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D.rc3
----------------------------------------------

Third release candidate.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added complete documentation and `Installation and Reference
     Manual' for the `OpenSS7 Master Package' (this manual).

   - Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):

         - `strbcm-0.9.2.2'
         - `striso-0.9.2.1'
         - `strsock-0.9.2.1'
         - `strtty-0.9.2.1'
         - `strutil-0.9.2.4'

   - Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Sub-packages will now support extended ranges of minor devices on
     2.6 kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.

   - This release candidate provides support for additional SuSE
     distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution
     support includes SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE
     10.1.

   - This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp
     drivers at the 2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British
     Columbia.  This version was interoperability tested with all
     implementations present.

This was an subscriber release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D.rc2
----------------------------------------------

Second release candidate.

This release candidate also contains the results of performance testing
of the new second generation UDP driver (implemented completely in
STREAMS instead of using an internal socket).

This release candidate also contains support for SuSE 10.1.

This was an subscriber release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.Drc1
---------------------------------------------

First release candidate.

   - Release candidate for Mark Fugate.

   - Added -enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.

   - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

This was an subscriber release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.C
------------------------------------------

Distribution check for entire master package.  Trying to get master
package into form where it can be released as a complete package.

This was a public release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.B
------------------------------------------

Minor changes for wider release, better master packaging and bug fixes.

This was a public release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.A
------------------------------------------

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
RPM release numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian
release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches and release
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable
release suffix for your organization.  We leave Debian release number
_1 reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the
.dsc file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
distribution support.

This was a public release.

 Initial release openss7-0.9.2-1
--------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM release of the OpenSS7 master package.

This master package contains all other OpenSS7 releases.
