   * Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and

     support includes SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE
     10.1.

   * This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp
     drivers at the 2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British
     Columbia.  This version was interoperability tested with all
     implementations present.

This was an subscriber release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D.rc2
----------------------------------------------

Second release candidate.

This release candidate also contains the results of performance testing
of the new second generation UDP driver (implemented completely in
STREAMS instead of using an internal socket).

This was an subscriber release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.Drc1
---------------------------------------------

First release candidate.

   * Release candidate for Mark Fugate.

   * Added -enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.

   * Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

This was an subscriber release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.C
------------------------------------------

Distribution check for entire master package.  Trying to get master
package into form where it can be released as a complete package.

This was a public release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.B
------------------------------------------

Minor changes for wider release, better master packaging and bug fixes.

This was a public release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.A
------------------------------------------

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
RPM release numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian
release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches and release
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable
release suffix for your organization.  We leave Debian release number
_1 reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the
.dsc file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
distribution support.

This was a public release.

 Initial release openss7-0.9.2-1
--------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM release of the OpenSS7 master package.

This master package contains all other OpenSS7 releases.
