The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 Master Package package.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.G
------------------------------------------

This is the sixth public release of the OpenSS7 Master Package.  See
`README' in the release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the
sub-packages in the release are production grade for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  All existing validation test suites run clean on
supported distributions and architectures.

The `OpenSS7 Master Package' is not released as often as the
sub-packages.  As sub-packages are released more often, to rebuild the
master package with a new sub-package release, simply replace the
directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked
sub-package release and then rebuild the master package.  This release
provides support for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Documented `lib32gcc1' problem on Ubuntu.

   - Noted problem running under XEN kernels.  XEN kernels are not yet
     supported.

   - License upgrade to AGPL v3.

   - Cross-compile fixes (strap out AC_FUNC_REALLOC macro when
     cross-compiling).

   - Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation
     primarily for embedded targets.

   - Improvements to common build process for embedded and
     cross-compile targets.

   - Support for flex 2.5.33  in maintainer mode.


_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU Affero General Public
License Version 3'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball,
SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs,
see the openss7 package page (http://www.openss7.org/openss7_pkg.html).

See `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/openss7-0.9.2.G/ChangeLog' and
`http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/openss7-0.9.2.G/NEWS' in the release
for more information.  Also, see the `openss7.pdf' manual in the
release (also in html `http://www.openss7.org/openss7_manual.html').

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.F
------------------------------------------

This is the fifth public release of the OpenSS7 Master Package.  See
`README' in the release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the
sub-packages in the release are production grade for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  All existing validation test suites run clean on
supported distributions and architectures.

The `OpenSS7 Master Package' is not released as often as the
sub-packages.  As sub-packages are released more often, to rebuild the
master package with a new sub-package release, simply replace the
directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked
sub-package release and then rebuild the master package.  This release
provides support for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Support build on openSUSE 10.2.

   - Support build on Fedora 7 and 2.6.21 kernel.

   - Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).

   - Support build on Ubuntu 7.04.

   - Updated to gettext 0.16.1.

   - Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 and
     2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 kernel.

   - Supports build on Fedora Core 6.

   - Support for recent distributions and tool chains.


 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.E
------------------------------------------

This is the fourth public release of the OpenSS7 Master Package.  See
`README' in the release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the
sub-packages in the release are production grade for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  All existing validation test suites run clean on
supported distributions and architectures.

It is unlikely that the `OpenSS7 Master Package' will be released as
frequently as before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To
rebuild the master package with a new sub-package release, simply
replace the directory to which the sub-package belongs with the
unpacked sub-package release and then rebuild the master package.  This
release provides support for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Addition of the `osr61' sub-package that contains Dialogic(R) Open
     System Release 6.1 version 239 GPL drivers.

   - A few minor corrections to the common build process.

   - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386
     kernels.

   - The package now looks for subpackages with a version number as
     unpacked by separate tarball.


 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D
------------------------------------------

This is the fourth public release of the OpenSS7 Master Package.  The
sub-packages have been reorganized for this release.  See `README' in
the release for a sub-package listing.  Aside from sub-package
reorganization, the major difference from previous release is that this
release no longer contains `LiS'.  Too many of the sub-packages will
not even build against `LiS' because of its Stream head deficiencies.

Most of the sub-packages in the release are production grade for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  All existing validation test suites run clean on
supported distributions and architectures.  The packages build better
Debian/Ubuntu .deb files.

It is unlikely that the `OpenSS7 Master Package' will be released as
frequently as before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To
rebuild the master package with a new sub-package release, simply
replace the directory to which the sub-package belongs with the
unpacked sub-package release and then rebuild the master package.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):

         - `strnsl-0.9.2.4'
         - `strbcm-0.9.2.5'
         - `striso-0.9.2.4'
         - `strsock-0.9.2.4'
         - `strtty-0.9.2.4'
         - `strutil-0.9.2.7'

   - Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   - This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp
     drivers at the 2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British
     Columbia.  This version was interoperability tested with all
     implementations present.

   - Better support for Ubuntu and recent `gcc' compilers, including
     debian script corrections.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versions to all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     `streams' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels:  LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SuSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86
     as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9,
     SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improvide compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic beahviour for some
     distributions (primarily SuSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - Each package will not build `doxygen(1)' html documentation with
     the `make doxy' target.  See `make help' or `README-make' in the
     distribution for more information.


 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D.rc3
----------------------------------------------

Third release candidate.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added complete documentation and `Installation and Reference
     Manual' for the `OpenSS7 Master Package' (this manual).

   - Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):

         - `strbcm-0.9.2.5'
         - `striso-0.9.2.4'
         - `strsock-0.9.2.4'
         - `strtty-0.9.2.4'
         - `strutil-0.9.2.7'

   - Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Sub-packages will now support extended ranges of minor devices on
     2.6 kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.

   - This release candidate provides support for additional SuSE
     distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution
     support includes SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE
     10.1.

   - This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp
     drivers at the 2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British
     Columbia.  This version was interoperability tested with all
     implementations present.

This was an subscriber release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D.rc2
----------------------------------------------

Second release candidate.

This release candidate also contains the results of performance testing
of the new second generation UDP driver (implemented completely in
STREAMS instead of using an internal socket).

This release candidate also contains support for SuSE 10.1.

This was an subscriber release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.Drc1
---------------------------------------------

First release candidate.

   - Release candidate for Mark Fugate.

   - Added -enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.

   - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

This was an subscriber release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.C
------------------------------------------

Distribution check for entire master package.  Trying to get master
package into form where it can be released as a complete package.

This was a public release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.B
------------------------------------------

Minor changes for wider release, better master packaging and bug fixes.

This was a public release.

 Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.A
------------------------------------------

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
RPM release numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian
release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches and release
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable
release suffix for your organization.  We leave Debian release number
_1 reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the
.dsc file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
distribution support.

This was a public release.

 Initial release openss7-0.9.2-1
--------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM release of the OpenSS7 master package.

This master package contains all other OpenSS7 releases.
