  * @section preface Preface
  *
  * @section intro Introduction
  *
  * This manual contains documentation taken directly from the source code using <b>doxygen</b>(1).
  * All <a href="http://www.openss7.org/">OpenSS7 Project</a> user level source code, programs and
  * libraries are documented using <b>doxygen</b>(1).
  *
  * @section overview Overview
  *
  * This manual provides developers and maintainers intensive informaiton concerning one OpenSS7
  * library contained in the @b "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" package, @b @PACKAGE@(@VERSION@).
  *
  * @li @ref streams
  *
  * @subsection typeographical Typeographical Conventions
  *
  * The typographical conventions of <b>doxygen</b>(1) apply with the following additional
  * conventions:
  *
  * @li Manual pages are typeset as `<b>manualpage</b>(section),' such as, for example, <b>doxygen</b>(1).
  *
  *	@defgroup stropts STREAMS Options and Input-Output Controls
  *	@brief Standard STREAMS Stream Head Options and Input-Output Controls.
  *
  *	@defgroup strcalls STREAMS System Calls
  *	@brief Standard STREAMS System Calls.

  *	    @brief STREAMS Test Module testmod(4).
  *
  *	    This module documents the user to STREAMS module interface between
  *	    the user and the Test Module (testmod(4)) STREAMS module.  This
  *	    module is primarily for testing in kernel specifics during
  *	    conformance testsuite runs (see test-streams(8)).  It performs
  *	    several rather highly specialized functions.
  *
  *	@defgroup strdrvs STREAMS Drivers
  *	@brief Standard STREAMS Drivers

  *	    @ingroup strdrvs
  *	    @brief STREAMS Adminstrative Driver sad(4).
  *
  *	    This driver's primary purpose is to support the autopush(8) command.
  *	    It provides an interface between user level programs and the
  *	    underlying autopush(5) mechanism of STREAMS(9).
