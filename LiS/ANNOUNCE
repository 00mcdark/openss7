LiS 2.18.3 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

LiS (Linux STREAMS) is a STREAMS framework that is compatible with UNIX
SVR 4 STREAMS as described in the "UNIX System V Release 4 Programmer's
Guide - STREAMS".

The LiS 2.18.3 release is the OpenSS7 Project's <http://www.openss7.org/>
most recent release of the Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernel compatible package.
It includes libraries, documentation and all the things needed to run
STREAMS for OpenSS7 SS7 packages and other LiS based products.

This release provides:

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.
    
 - Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler warnings.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.  Builds on FC4 2.6.15 kernel and with gcc 4.0.2.

 - Added in many of Paul's 64-bit corrections.

 This is an unstable public alpha release of the package.

This release, as the release before it, suppresses versioning of
LiS exported symbols and restores to a large degree binary compatibility
of interface functions with LiS 2.18.0.  It again contains the pipe
performance programs an POSIX conformance test suite used with Linux
Fast-STREAMS for comparison testing between LiS and Linux Fast-STREAMS.
These programs were used to generate the comparison performance test
results <http://www.openss7.org/streams_perf.html> and conformance test
results <http://www.openss7.org/streams_pics.html>.

A large number of additional tests cases were found to fail on x86_64
and SMP architectures making the LiS packages largely unusable.  Please
read <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/LiS-2.18.3/README-alpha> in the
release.

The package is still largely unusable on 64-bit or SMP kernels.  Linux
STREAMS IS DEPRECATED.  DO NOT USE IT.  THE PACKAGE CONTAINS MANY
UNRESOLVED BUGS.  USE Linux Fast-STREAMS INSTEAD.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's third, and likely last, LiS-2.18.0-based
release of LiS.  The release includes all of the improvements from
previous releases as well as a few additional 64-bit patches.  The
OpenSS7 Project will be replacing LiS with Linux Fast-STREAMS in all
further production releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the LiS package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/streams_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/LiS-2.18.3/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/LiS-2.18.3/NEWS> in the release for
more information.  Also, see the manual/LiS.pdf manual in the release
(also at <http://www.openss7.org/LiS_manual.html>).

		OpenSS7 Linux STREAMS (LiS), SVR 4 STREAMS for Linux.
		LiS is a STREAMS framework that is compatible with SVR4
		STREAMS.  It has lots of debugging features not found in other
		STREAMS packages.  Good to do networking and other things.  It
		allows for installation of binary drivers.
		This distribution is currently applicable to 2.4 and 2.6 kernels
		and was targeted at ix86, x86_64, ppc and ppc64 architectures,
		but should build and install for other architectures as well.
		Mailing-List: linux-streams@gsyc.escet.urjc.es
		Supports a wide range of new and old Linux distributions.
