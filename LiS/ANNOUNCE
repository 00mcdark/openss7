Package LiS-2.18.4 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 Linux STREAMS (LiS) package is an OpenSS7 modified version
of the LiS-2.18 package formerly from GCOM, and formerly maintained by
David Grothe <dave@gcom.com>.

_Note_: The original LiS package from GCOM is no longer actively
maintained by either GCOM or the OpenSS7 Project: use the OpenSS7 Linux
Fast-STREAMS package <http://www.openss7.org/STREAMS.html> instead.

The following are claims made by its authors and original maintainer:

     The OpenSS7 Modified Linux STREAMS (LiS) package is as STREAMS
     framework that is compatible with SVR 4 STREAMS.  It has lots of
     debugging features not found in other STREAMS packages.  Good to do
     networking and other things.  It allows for installation of binary
     drivers.

Linux STREAMS (LiS) aims to provide SVR 4 compatible STREAMS
implementation for Linux and claims to have special debugging
facilities; however, the package suffers from the major failings that it
is:

   - no longer maintained;
   - full of bugs;
   - incompatible with POSIX;
   - implements SVR 4 STREAMS rather than the more popular SVR 4.2 MP/ES
     STREAMS;
   - portions dubiously licensed under the LGPL;
   - unsuitable for mainline adoption;
   - adapts poorly to production kernels;
   - many SMP races and lockups;
   - broken 32-bit over 64-bit compatibility;
   - no strlog(9) STREAMS logger;

This is the final release of LiS.  There are too many packages now that
cannot build against LiS because it is lacking fundamental capabilities
in the Stream head.

This release builds both 32-bit compatibility and 64-bit native
libraries and functions on 64-bit architectures.  One of the major
reasons for doing this for LiS was to demonstrate its sad lack of
ability to sustain any form of 32-bit compatibility on most 64-bit
architectures.  Test suites now run first 64-bit native and then 32-bit
compatibility tests to demonstrate LiS' dismal failure in this regard.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Added `send-pr' scripts for automatic problem report generation.
     (Please do not report bugs on LiS.)

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Corrected start of assignment of major devices numbers (back to
     230).

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Bug fixes to STREAMS library for proper asynchronous thread
     cancellation handling.  Versioning of all library symbols.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

_This is an unsable public alpha release of the package.  Please see
README-alpha in the release.  Do not report bugs on this package._

A large number of additional test cases were found to fail on x86_64 and
SMP architectures making the LiS packages largely unusable, especially
on 64-bit or SMP kernels.

Deprecated and unmaintained.  Download the latest `streams' package
version instead.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public
License Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball,
SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
LiS package page (http://www.openss7.org/LiS_pkg.html).

Package LiS-2.18.5 was released under GPLv2 2007-03-15.

The OpenSS7 Linux STREAMS (LiS) package is an OpenSS7 modified version
of the LiS-2.18 package formerly from GCOM, and formerly maintained by
David Grothe.

Note: The original LiS package from GCOM is no longer actively
maintained by either GCOM or the OpenSS7 Project: use the OpenSS7 Linux
Fast-STREAMS package instead.

The following are claims made by its authors and original maintainer:

 The OpenSS7 Modified Linux STREAMS (LiS) package is as STREAMS

 - portions dubiously licensed under the LGPL;
 - unsuitable for mainline adoption;
 - adapts poorly to production kernels;
 - many SMP races and lockups;
 - broken 32-bit over 64-bit compatibility;
 - no strlog(9) STREAMS logger;

This is an internal release of LiS.  There are too many packages now
that cannot build against LiS because it is lacking fundamental
capabilities in the Stream head.

Do not use this release.  Port to Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Do not report
bugs on this release.  (Yup, there are lots of 'em, but that's LiS.)

Major changes for release LiS-2.18.5

 - Added versions to all exported symbols.  Made LiS functions GPL
   export.

 - Improvements to the common build environment with better support for
   standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

 - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 2.10 and gettext 0.16.

 - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.

This is an unstable public alpha release of the package.  Please see
README-alpha in the release.  information.  Do not report bugs on this
package.

A large number of additional tests cases were found to fail on x86_64
and SMP architectures making the LiS packages largely unusable,
especially on 64-bit or SMP kernels.

Deprecated and unmaintained.  Download the latest streams package
version instead.
