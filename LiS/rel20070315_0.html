This is an internal release of LiS.  There are too many packages now that cannot build against LiS
because it is lacking fundamental capabilities in the Stream head.

Do not use this release.  Port to Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Do not report bugs on this release.  (Yup,
there are lots of 'em, but that's LiS.)

A large number of additional tests cases were found to fail on x86_64 and SMP architectures making
the LiS packages largely unusable, especially on 64-bit or SMP kernels.

OpenSS7 today announced Release 2.18.5 of the Linux STREAMS <em>LiS</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 Linux STREAMS (LiS) package is an OpenSS7 modified version of the LiS-2.18 package
formerly from GCOM, and formerly maintained by David Grothe.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<em>Note</em>: The original LiS package from GCOM is no longer actively maintained by either GCOM or
the OpenSS7 Project: use the <a href="http://www.openss7.org/STREAMS.html"> OpenSS7 Linux
Fast-STREAMS</a> package instead.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The following are claims made by its authors and original maintainer:
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<blockquote>
The OpenSS7 Modified Linux STREAMS (LiS) package is as STREAMS framework that is compatible with SVR
4 STREAMS.  It has lots of debugging features not found in other STREAMS packages.  Good to do
networking and other things.  It allows for installation of binary drivers.
</blockquote>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Linux STREAMS (LiS) aims to provide SVR 4 compatible STREAMS implementation for Linux and claims to
have special debugging facilities; however, the package suffers from the major failings that it is:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>no longer maintained;</li>
<li>full of bugs;</li>
<li>incompatible with POSIX;</li>
<li>implements SVR 4 STREAMS rather than the more popular SVR 4.2 MP/ES STREAMS;</li>
<li>portions dubiously licensed under the LGPL;</li>
<li>unsuitable for mainline adoption;</li>
<li>adapts poorly to production kernels;</li>
<li>many SMP races and lockups;</li>
<li>broken 32-bit over 64-bit compatibility;</li>
<li>no <a href="http://www.openss7.org/man2html?strlog(9)">strlog(9)</a> STREAMS logger;</li>
</ul><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
