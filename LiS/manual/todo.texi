Things to do:

The OpenSS7 release of Linux STREAMS was in maintenance mode for over a year and the latest 2.18
releases are quite stable.  However, LiS is fraught with bugs and suffers from a aging design
approach making it unsuitable for production use.  It fails many of the conformance test cases in
the test suite and even locks the kernel on a number of cases on SMP kernels regardless of their
being run on a UP machine.

The OpenSS7 Project wrote a new STREAMS package for Linux called Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Linux
Fast-STREAMS is now far more stable than LiS, and The OpenSS7 Project will no longer perform
develoment on the LiS package, unless at the bequest of a project sponsor.  As such, LiS is
deprecated.  Use the latest streams package from the OpenSS7 download site at
<http://www.openss7.org/download.html> instead.

@itemize @minus
@item
Last remaining to do item is to release the LiS-2.18.3 release that might very well be the last
release.
