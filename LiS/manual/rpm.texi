In addition, the following @command{rpm} options, specific to the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package are available:

@table @command
@item --with solaris-cmn_err
@itemx --without solaris-cmn_err
Specifies whether Solaris-style @code{cmn_err} is used.  The Solaris style
prints a newline at the end of each statement.  The SVR 4.2 style prints a
newline at the beginning of each statement unless @code{CE_CONT} is specified.
Linux kernel logs use the former, so this defaults to Solaris-style.

@item --with solaris-consts
@itemx --without solaris-consts
Attempt to be compatible with Solaris constants.  The default is to attempt to
be compatible with SVR 4.2/Unixware constants.

@item --with k-cache
@itemx --without k-cache
Invoke Linux kernel caching on primary structures.  This incresase speed and
efficiency.  The default is to perform kernel caching on primary structures.

@item --with k-timers
@itemx --without k-timers
Invoke Linux kernel cahcing on timer structures.  This increases speed and
efficiency but is unsafe on SMP architectures and for buggy drivers.  The
default is to perform kernel caching on timer structures.

@item --with broken-cpu-flags
@itemx --without broken-cpu-flags
Specify @code{int} instead of @code{long} interrupt flags.  Linux uses
@code{long} interrupt flags exclusively.  The default is to use @code{long}
interrupt flags.

@item --with atomic-stats
@itemx --without atomic-stats
Specify @code{atomic_t} element types for elements of the @code{module_stat}
structure instead of @code{int} element types.  The default is to use @code{int}
elements types for the @code{module_stat} structure.

@ignore
@item --with tli
@itemx --without tli
Build and package the TLI modules (@file{streams-timod.o} and
@file{streams-tirdwr.o}).  These are needed by the XTI/XNS Unix98 libraries.
The default is to build and package TLI modules.
@pgindex streams-timod.o
@pgindex streams-tirdwr.o

@item --with inet
@itemx --without inet
Build and package the INET driver (@file{streams-inet.o}).  This driver is
needed for XTI/XNS Unix98 compatibility.  The default is to build and package
the INET driver.
@pgindex streams-inet.o

@item --with xnet
@itemx --without xnet
Build and package the XTI/XNS library (@file{libxnet}).  This library is needed for
XTI/XNS Unix98 compatiblity.  The default is to build and package the XNET
library.
@pgindex libxnet.a
@pgindex libxnet.so
@end ignore
