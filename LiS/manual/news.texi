@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

Third release candidiate.

@itemize
@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.

@item
Added versioning of all library symbols.

@item
Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
documentation present in the release directory.

@item
Many documentation updates for all @uref{http://www.openss7.org/,, OpenSS7}
packages.

@item
This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp drivers at the
@cite{2006 SCTP Interop} at the @cite{University of British Columbia}.  This
version was interoperability tested with all implementations present.

@item
This release candidate provides support for additional @cite{SuSE}
distributions on @code{ix86} as well as @code{x86_64}.  Added distribution
support includes @cite{SLES 9}, @cite{SLES 9 SP2}, @cite{SLES 9 SP3},
@cite{SLES 10}, @cite{SuSE 10.1}.

@item
Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
distributions.

@item
Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in
addition to kernel programs.  Added new @option{--with-optimize} option to
@command{configure} to accomplish this.

@item
Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent @command{gcc}
compilers and some idiosynchratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily
SUSE):

@multitable @columnfractions .01 .99
@item @minus{} @tab Remove @option{-fno-reorder-blocks} and
@option{-fno-reorder-functions} options added by some recent 2.6
@file{Makefile}s for @samp{x86_64} architecture: it impedes performance
optimizations.
@item @minus{} @tab Remove @option{-ffunction-sections} option added by some
rececent 2.6 @file{Makefile}s for @samp{x86_64} architecture: this is an
insane option and should never have been used.
@item @minus{} @tab Add @option{-ffreestanding} that some older 2.6
@file{Makefile}s (such as that with @cite{SLES 9 2.6.5} kernel) neglect to add
to the @command{gcc} command line.
@item @minus{} @tab @cite{SLES 10} expands the directory before
@file{autoconf.h} on the @command{gcc} command line for some reason.
@command{configure} script watches out for this now.
@end multitable

@item
Updated @command{init} scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

@item
Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device
number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.

@item
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} now supports expanded addressable minor device
numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number on
2.6 kernels: unfortunately, @value{PACKAGE} cannot support this change.
@end itemize

This was an internal alpha test release candidate and was not released publicly.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.3

Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on x86_64
architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler
warnings.

Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on mailing
list.  Builds on FC4 2.6.15 kernel and with gcc 4.0.2.

Added in many of Paul's 64-bit corrections.

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} 2.18.3} is still largely unusable on 64-bit or
SMP kernels.  @b{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package is deprecated.  Do not use it.
The package contains many unresovled bugs. Use @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}
instead.}

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.2
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.2
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.2

Cross-build support for newer @cite{Nex@-us@-Ware} releases.  Build support
for (recent FC4) 2.6.14 kernel.  Corrected installation support (init scripts)
for SuSE 9.2.

Binary compatibility backwards compatible to GCOM 2.18.0 included.  This
includes exported symbols changed to not generate versioned symbols on 2.4
kernels.  Also, exported symbols are always compiled
@code{attribute((regparm(0)))} on regparm capable architectures, regardless of
the kernel version or compile options.@footnote{Regparm capable architectures
are really just @code{__i386__} and similar such as @code{__x86_64__} and
@code{k8}.} For actual binary compatibilty packaging, see the @file{strcompat}
package.

A major change for 2.18.2 is the port-back of POSIX/SUSv3 XSR/XSI conformance
test suites and performance programs from Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The purpose of
porting back theses tests suites and supporting modules and drivers is to
provide the ability to do comparison tests between LiS and Linux Fast-STREAMS.

Another change is a module unloading safe vstrlog hook register and unregister
functions register_strlog() and unregister_strlog().

Some bug corrections and fixes for glaring SMP errors reported by Kutluck.

This might be the last OpenSS7 release of @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.  You
should seriously consider using the Linux Fast-STREAMS package (streams-0.7a.4
or later) instead.  If you need comptibility to LiS (or other STREAMS
implementation), investigate the strcompat package, which provides some binary
compatibility to LiS under Linux Fast STREAMS.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.1
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the @command{@value{PACKAGE}} release.

This is a port forward of most of the build and patches from 2.16.19 forward
and applied over 2.18.0.  This is our first @value{PACKAGE}-2.18 release.  All
further development on 2.16.19 will now cease.  2.18.1 is maintained on both
2.4 and 2.6 kernels.  No active development will be performed on 2.18.1, only
maintenance.  For an active development release, see the Linux Fast-STREAMS
releases.

Major changes from @value{PACKAGE}-2.18.0 include all of the autoconf build
system, manual pages and texi/pdf manual for LiS that were applied on the
2.16.19 release.  This includes a number of 64 bit, HPPA, PARISC, printf,
atomic stats, HZ calculations for 64bit machines, DMA patch for mblk buffer
alignment, flush handling patch, panic patch, smp patch, parisc syscall patch,
appq patch, and multithreaded test program patches, POSIX threads compilant
library functions.

Additional changes made to support later 2.6 kernels and distributions.
Switched putpmsg()/getpmsg() to use ioctl for system call emulation instead of
read()/write(), primarily because 2.6.11 kernels check for a valid count
before calling the driver's read()/write() file operations.  Updates to the
build system to support a wider range of kernels and distributions.  See the
installation and reference manual for a complete list of supported kernels and
distributions.

Please note that the entire package is released under GPL.

@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-22
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-22

Replaced m4 and automake files with common equivalents.  This allows the same
set of m4 macros and automake fragments to be used with all of the OpenSS7
release packages.  Maintenance is easier as one correction will propagate
across all items.  Performed similar function with texinfo documentation
pieces.

@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-21
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-21

Removed all XTI/TLI and Linux networking code, headers and documentation from
LiS distribution and bumped epoch to 2.  Linux networking code has been
migrated to the @strong{strxns}, @strong{strxnet}, @strong{strinet} and
@strong{strsctp} packages.  The purpose for doing this was to allow the Linux
networking to build against Linux Fast-STREAMS as well as
@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} and is a preparation for phasing out LiS and
phasing in LfS.

Added missing @file{configure.nexusware} to distribution.  LiS cache options
now default to 'no' because of instabilities with timers.

Not publicly released.

Changes to compile, install and builds rpms for Fedora Core 1 (FC1), Whitebox
Enterprise Linux (WBEL) and RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 (EL3).  Included
explicit epoch in internal dependencies in spec file for RPM versions 4.2.1,
4.2.2 and higher.  Added hugemem kernel detection and moved getpmsg and
putpmsg manual pages.

Correction to symbolic linking and system map file location during non-rpm
autoconf installation.

Correction to zero @code{maxlen} behavior in @code{t_rcvconnect()}.

Added check for @code{CONFIG_REGPARM}, addition of @code{-mregparm=3}
@code{CFLAGS}, addition of @code{regparm_} prefix for exported ksyms.

Minor corrections to separate build directory install of devices and caching
of detected ksyms.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-17
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-17
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-17

Added option @code{--disable-k-modversions} to supress versioning of LiS
exported symbols.

A couple of corrections to the build process reported by Gurol.  Changed order
of build in `make rebuild' target to build tools last so that the rpm debug
package is built correctly on RH9.

Change @code{MODULE_PARM} to static so that @code{make install-strip} does not
strip module parameter symbols.

Added @code{lis_check_mem_region()}, @code{lis_release_mem_region()} and
@code{lis_request_mem_region()} for memory mapped io instead of just io.

Added @code{printk} patches discussed on linux-stream mailling list.  Added
gcc @code{printf} checking and corrected errors in LiS debugging @code{printk}
statements.

Added HP patches.  There are a couple of questionable components in the HP
patches that I reversed.  They include;

@itemize @bullet
@item
modification of @code{lis_msgsize} to @code{lis_msgdsize}.  This would change
the calculation of queue counts.  Queue counts aren't @code{M_DATA} counts,
they are "data" message counts.  LiS probably doesn't have this the right way,
but @code{lis_msgdsize} is not correct either.

@item
addition of @code{qi_mstat->ms_pcnt} increment on @code{lis_safe_putmsg}.
Same for @code{ms_scnt}, @code{ms_ocnt}, @code{ms_ccnt}.  STREAMS is not
supposed to increment counts.  It is the module writer's responsibility to
increment counts in their own queue procedures.
@end itemize


Added HP @code{ldl} patches.

Made modifications to @code{putq()}, @code{putbq()}, @code{insq()} and
@code{appq()} discussed on linux-streams mailing list.  These do not free
messages on failure.  Modified all ocurrences internal to LiS to free the
message on error to ensure old behavior.

Added HP dejagnu patches to @code{strtst} and added dejagnu testsuite
directory and file.  Added the @code{make check} target.  Use @code{DEJATOOLS}
on the make command line to invoke the tests, such as `@code{make
DEJATOOLS=strtst check}' to invoke the tests.  Because a patched
@code{netperf} is not commonly available and @code{netperf} will not be
distributed with the package, GNU @code{autotest} might be a better choice.
But that's for a later release.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-16
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-16
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18-16

General updates to the build process, optimization options, build options.
Corrected library linkage.  Synced TLI modules and INET driver to Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  Removed deadlock from INET driver and loosened locking.
Unfortunately suitable libraries must be installed before distcheck will
clear.

Smoother and more reliable stripping of kernel symbols, starts with
/proc/ksyms if applicable then System.map then modversions.h to attempt to
choose symbols most closely synced with an installed or running kernel.

Improvements to autoconf installation of manpages (autocompressed now) and
info and pdf manuals are distributed.  install-strip target will actually
properly strip kernel modules.

Included an option to build and install only kernel or user parts of package
to speed rpm rebuild process for multiple kernel.  Added `rebuild' target to
rebuild the rpms from srpm for multiple kernel and architectures.  Added a
`sign' and `resign' target to sign srpm and rebuilt rpms respectively.

Greatly enhanced cross-build and cross-compile support, primarily in support
of the NexusWare embedded target.  Added NexusWare helper script and
documentation.  DESTDIR is now a blessed environment variable used by
configure to set the cross-build root as well as the install root.  Try adding
--with-k-optimize='size' to configure to optimize for size for embedded
targets.  Builds clean against NexusWare24 (810p0674.10-rc4).

Added start of an option to build as linkable object for embedded targets
rather than loadable kernel module.

Added defaults for SK_WMEM_MAX and SK_RMEM_MAX for lastest 2.4.25 and 2.4.26
kernel builds.

Enhanced build process.
  
All kernel symbols exported by LiS are versioned on kernels that have
versioned symbols.  This makes it safer to compile kernel modules against
kernel/LiS combinations.  This is in preparation for splitting off the strxnet
package, and the technique was imported from the Linux Fast-STREAMS build.

Added support for cooked manpages both for non-rpm systems and for rpm
systems.  It is still better to leave manpages uncooked for rpm releases
because they are much smaller that way.  Give the --with-cooked-manpages flag
to configure if you want cooked manpages.  You still need grefer on the build
system.

Updates to all manual pages in man7, and some others (xti) in man3.  Removed
unused .macros and .refs files.

Moved automake fragments into separate directory.  Cleaned up automake
fragments.

Rearranged header files in the xti subdirectory to install in LiS package
include directory instead.  Reworked xti, tihdr and tiuser file groups to
include properly from kernel or user space independent of order.  tiuser and
xti still cannot be included together.  Added older TLI interface <tiuser.h>
that is still consistent with newer XTI interface.  Changed references in man
pages to XTI/TLI instead of just XTI.

Added ticlts.h, ticots.h and ticotsord.h header files.  Updated dlpi.h and
npi.h header files.  Removed sys/LiS/tpicommon.h because it is largely
replaced by sys/tli.h and sys/tpi.h.  Removed the, now redundant, xti header
file subdirectory.

A series of bug fixes to xnet.c (libxnet) that resulted from discussions with
Gurol Akman on openss7-develop mailing list.  Mostly surrounding t_alloc and
t_getinfo behaviour and the behavior when NULL pointers are passed to various
XTI/TLI library calls.  Updated xti documentation as well.

Many changes to the inet.c INET driver.  Wildcard IP addresses can now be
bound and wildcard addresses will be assigned with no address is passed to
most providers.  (/dev/rawip still requires an address or TNOADDR is
returned.)  Option management has been extensively rewritten to be more
conformant to XNS documentation.  Test programs test-inet_raw, test-inet_udp,
test-inet_tcp have been upgraded and converted to multiple child processes.  A
number of fixes to SMP lock behavior and M_FLUSH have beend added as reported
by Dave Grothe.  Corrected all level and TBADOPT behavior on negotiation.

Although this driver is now closer to expected behavior, it has not been
tested for XNS 5.2 compliance, nor will it be until someone has the time to
extend the test programs to handle all test cases in a similar manner as was
done for the library.  Your mileage many vary.  Remember, there is no
warranty.

This OpenSS7 release of @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18 updates the previous
@value{PACKAGE}-2.16.16 rpm release to the lastest @value{PACKAGE}-2.16
release level.

This OpenSS7 release of @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.16 includes autoconf for
configuration, complete manual pages and documentation, and packaging in
source and binary RPMs for ease and repeatability of installation.  The
package also builds and installs properly versioned LiS shared object
libraries.

Before the OpenSS7 release of LiS, it was necessary to have a significant
working knowledge of the Linux kernel, kernel source, headers and other
intricacies.  This made it difficult to distribute software based on LiS to
users not proficient in those areas.  The OpenSS7 release removes the
configuration and installation tasks from the user and permits distribution of
applications, modules and driver software based on LiS to users without
sufficient kernel expertise to install the package.

This OpenSS7 release fixes few of the outstanding bugs and deficiencies of the
LiS software.  This release is intended to package and distribute LiS in an
efficient manner and, for the most part, does not address LiS deficiencies or
errors.

This OpenSS7 release is compatible with Linux 2.4 kernels only and will refuse
to configure for older or newer kernels.

Following are the new features of the OpenSS7 release of LiS:

@itemize @bullet
@item
adds configuration using the GNU tools, autoconf, automake and autotest.

These tools greatly enhance the ability to maintain a repeatable and testable
release cycle as well as being compatible with most major package managers
such as Redhat's RPM.

@item
adds long options to all LiS utilities.

This change was necessitated because we use GNITS (the strictest level) of
configuration with autoconf that requires for distribution checking that all
utility programs support the @samp{--help} and @samp{--version} long options
wtihout side-effects.

@item
provides a source and binary release mechanism using both autoconf
distributions as well as RedHat source and binary RPMs.

Use of the RPM mechanism for release permits add-on packages to ensure that
they have sufficient level of support and verionsing of the LiS load during
their build and installation process.  It is now also possible to ensure that
add on binaries are compatible with a loaded LiS during installation.

@item
includes a complete set of kernel programmer manual pages for all LiS exported
kernel functions for use by STREAMS module and driver developers.

@item
includes a complete set of user manual pages for all libLiS functions and
separate administrative utilities.

@item
includes the OpenSS7 strinet driver providing XTI/TLI access to the Linux
native NET4 IP stack including TCP, UDP, IP and (and OpenSS7 SCTP if your
kernel is so equipped).

@item
includes functional @code{tirdwr} and @code{timod} modules for use with the
included XTI/TLI library.@footnote{The @code{tirdwr} module included with the
Gcom @value{PACKAGE}-2.16.18 (and even more current) releases is almost
completely disfunctional and has been replaced in entirety.}

@item
includes complete, thread-safe XNS 5.2 XTI/TLI library support with the
@file{libxnet} library, complete manual pages and documentation released under
the LGPL (@pxref{GNU Lesser General Public License}).

The next release may include some @dfn{strss7} software.
