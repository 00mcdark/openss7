pointers of the new message block are set to the same values as the duplicated
message block.  The data block remains untouched.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"

Upon success,
.BR dupb ()
returns a pointer to the duplicated message block,
.IR bp .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR dupb ()
returnes a
.B NULL
.I bp
pointer.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR dupb ()
fails, it returns a
.B NULL
pointer.
.BR dupb ()
can fail because the passed in message point,
.IR mp ,
is
.BR NULL ;
or, the new message block cannot be allocated.
Normaly if
.BR dupb ()
fails,
.BR esbbcall (9)
should be called with the
.I priority
associated with the message for which duplication failed.
