.TH APPQ 9 "$Date: 2005/03/12 13:06:42 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B appq
\- append a \fISTREAMS\fR message after another
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI int " retval " "= appq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp1 ", mblk_t *" mp2 );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue to which to append the message.
.TP
.I mp1
the message after which to append the message.
.TP
.I mp2
the message to append.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR appq ()
appends the
.IR STREAMS (4)
message
.I mp2
just after the message
.I mp1
already on queue
.IR q .
If there is no message after
.I mp1
in the queue
.IR q ,
this has the same effect as
calling
.BR putq (9)
with
.IR mp2 .
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR appq ()
returns true (1) and the message pointed to by
.I mp
has been appended into the queue.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR appq ()
returns false (0) and the message pointed to by
.I mp
remains unaltered.  (See
.RB " BUGS "
below.)
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR appq ()
fails, it returns false (0).
.BR appq ()
fails if any of
.IR q ", " mp1 " or " mp2
is
.BR NULL ,
or if
.I q
is not
.BR NULL ,
but does not point to a valid queue structure;
the queue assocaited with the passed in queue pointer
.I q
has flags
.BR QCLOSING " or " QPROCSOFF
set indicating that the queue is closing or has had put and service processing
turned off (e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR appq ()
is implemented with a call to
.BR insq (9).
\fB\)appq(\fI\)q\fB\), \fI\)mp1\fB\), \fI\)mp2\fB\))\fR
is functionally equivalent to
\fB\)insq(\fI\)q\fB\), \fI\)mp1->b_next\fB\), \fI\)mp2\fB\))\fR.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Because
.BR appq ()
calls
.BR insq (9),
it is subject to the same bugs as
.BR insq (9).
See
.RB " BUGS "
in
.BR insq (9)
for more information.
.\"
.\"
.SH VERSIONS
.PP
.BR appq ()
is an
.BR LiS -specific
function.
.[
LiS
.]
Before OpenSS7 release
.BR LIS-2.16.18-17 ,
.BR appq ()
returned
.BR void .
As of OpenSS7 release
.BR LIS-2.16.18-17 ,
.BR appq ()
returns
.BR int .
