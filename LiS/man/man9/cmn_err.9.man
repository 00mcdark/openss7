.TH CMN_ERR 9 "$Date: 2005/03/09 23:13:59 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.SH NAME
.B cmn_err
\- print a kernel command error
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/cmn_err.h>
.HP 8
.BI "cmn_err(int " err_lvl ", char *" fmt ", " ... );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
prints a command error message to kernel log files at the level specified by
.I err_lev
and with the
.BR printk ()
formatted format string
.I fmt
and associated variable arguments.
.PP
.I err_lvl
may be one of the following values:
.TP 12
.B CE_CONT
This level indicates to continue printing.
.TP 12
.B CE_NOTE
This error level is for notices.  Notices are important events which should be
logged.
This equates to a
.B KERN_NOTICE
level in
.BR Linux .
.TP 12
.B CE_WARN
This error level is for warinings.  These are critical conditions, however,
these errors do not halt the kernel.
This equates to a
.B KERN_WARNING
level in
.BR Linux .
.TP 12
.B CE_PANIC
This error level is a panic error level.  This is for highly critical errors
where the kernel has destabilized and it is necessary to halt the kernel.
.RS
.PP
When the
.I err_lvl
is specified as
.BR CE_PANIC ,
.BR cmn_err ()
will generate a
.B Linux
kernel panic with the resulting message.
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
Unlike
.BR printk (),
.BR cmn_err ()
returns
.BR void .
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
fails silently when the
.I err_lvl
is invalid or formatting of the message
per
.I fmt
and the variable arguments fails.
