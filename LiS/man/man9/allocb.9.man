.SH NAME
.B allocb
\- allocate a \fISTREAMS\fR message and data block
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "mblk_t *" mp " = allocb(int " size ", unsigned int " priority );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I size
the size of message buffer to allocate.
.TP
.I priority
the priority of the allocation request.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR allocb ()
allocates a message block and a data block of the requested
.IR size " and " priority .
.PP
If the requested
.I size
is less than the
.IR STREAMS (4)
constant
.B FASTBUF
then a data block of size
.B FASTBUF
will be created.
If the requested
.I size
is larger than the
.IR STREAMS (4)
constant
.B FASTBUF
then a data block of size
.I size
will be created.
.PP
The
.I priority
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP 12
.B BPRI_LO
The caller requests a low priority message buffer.
.TP 12
.B BPRI_MED
The caller requests a medium priority message buffer.
.TP 12
.B BPRI_HI
The caller requests a high priority message buffer.
.RE
.PP
The allocated mesage block will have a data block type of
.BR M_DATA .
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR allocb ()
will
return a pointer,
.IR mp ,
to the allocated message block.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR allocb ()
will
return a
.B NULL
message pointer,
.IR mp .
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When an error occurs,
.BR allocb ()
will return a
.B NULL
message pointer
.IR mp .
.PP
.BR allocb ()
will only fail if there is insufficient memory to allocate the necessary
datastructures for the message block, data block or data buffer.
.PP
Failure to allocate a message block is typically followed by a call to
.BR bufcall "(9) or " esbbcall (9).
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
As with other post-SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
.[
svr42
.]
compliant
.IR STREAMS (4)
implementations, LiS
.[
LiS
.]
ignores the
.I priority
argument to
.BR allocb ().
The message block
.I priority
was an SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
concept which was found not to be useful, primarily due to
priority inversion.
For a history of the
.I priority
mechanism and a discussion as to why the mechanism was abandonned in
SVR 4.2,

and continued in SVR 4.2 STREAMS.
