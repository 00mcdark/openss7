.TH UNTIMEOUT 9 "$Date: 2005/03/09 23:14:14 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.SH NAME
.B untimeout, lis_untimeout
\- stop a timer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/dki.h>
.HP 8
.BI "toid_t " retval " = untimeout(toid_t " tid );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
stops a timer previously started with
.BR timeout (9).
.I tid
is the timer identifier that was returned from a previous call to
.BR timeout (9).
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
is typically used to stop timers before they expire, and to deallocate timers
before a stream is closed.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
returns a
.B timo_t
defined as follows:
.sp
.nf
typedef int toid_t;
typedef int timeout_id_t;
.fi
.PP
The return value from
.BR untimeout ()
is undefined and ignored.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
fails silently
.IR "" ( retval
is ignored) when
the timer associated with the timer identifier
.I tid
no longer exists or is invalid.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
provides a wrapper to Linux Kernel timer functions to implement
.BR timeout ().
.BR LiS 's
implementation
.[
LiS
.]
creates a Linux timer structure, assigns it a sequential
integer timer identifier, and places it in a timer list.
Whenever
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
stops a timer, it checks the list for the integer timer identifier with
interrupts disabled.  This is an exhaustive linear search.  This is
inefficient.
.IR STREAMS (4)
modules or drivers that stop timers often will experience poorer performance
than if the Linux kernel timer facility was used
directly.
