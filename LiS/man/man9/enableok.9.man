.TH ENABLEOK 9 "$Date: 2005/03/09 23:13:59 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.SH NAME
.B enableok
\- allows a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue to be scheduled
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "enableok(queue_t *" q );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR enableok ()
clears the
.B QNOENB
flag on the specified
.IR q .
This tells the
.IR STREAMS (4)
executive that the
.I q
can be scheduled for
.BR runqueues ().
.PP
.BR enableok ()
is typically used to re-enable a queue after it has been disabled with
.BR noenable (9).
.PP
If
.BR enableok ()
has been called for a
.IR q ,
and
.BR noenable (9)
has not subsequently been called for the same
.IR q ,
a second call to
.BR enableok ()
will have no effect.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
.BR enableok ()
returns void.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
If the
.I q
passed to
.BR enableok ()
is
.B NULL
or does not point to a queue structure,
then
.BR enableok ()
will silently fail.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR enableok ()
does not add the
.I q
to the current
.BR runqueues ()
schedule list.  It only clears the
.B QNOENB
flag to indicate whether the queue should be subsequently scheduled.
To add a
.I q
to the current run list, use
.BR qenable (9).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR noenable (9),
.BR canenable (9),
and
.BR qenable (9).
