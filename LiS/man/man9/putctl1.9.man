.SH NAME
.B putctl1, lis_putctl1
\- puts a 1 byte control message on a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int " retval " = putctl1(queue_t *" q ", int " type ", int " param );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue to which to put a control message.
.TP
.I type
the type of control message.
.TP
.I param
a one byte parameter for the message.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR putctl1 ()
creates a one-byte control message of type
.I type
with the one-byte data containing the data
.I param
and invokes the put procedure of the queue pointed to by
.I q
to place the message on the queue.
If
.I type
is a data message type and not a control message type,
.BR putctl1 ()
will fail.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"

returns true (1).
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR putctl1 ()
returns false (0).
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR putctl1 ()
fails and returns false (0) if the specified
.I type
is not a control message type, or if the passed in queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
or, if allocation of the necessary message blocks fails.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
None.
.SH BUGS
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
.BR putctl1 ()
will return success even if the operation fails because of the following
conditions:
.I q
is not
.BR NULL ,
but points to something other than a queue structure;
the queue pointed to by
.I q
has a
.I q_info
pointer of
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointed to by
.I q
has no put procedure; or the queue pointed to by
.I q
is closing, or the queue has had put and service routine processing turned off
(e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.B LiS
.[
LiS

should return failure when the operation fails.
