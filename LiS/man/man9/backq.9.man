.TH BACKQ 9 "$Date: 2005/03/09 23:13:58 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.SH NAME
.B backq
\- find the upstream or downstream \fISTREAMS\fR queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "queue_t *" bq " = backq(queue_t *" q );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR backq ()
returns the queue,
.IR bq ,
which feeds messages to the specified queue,
.IR q .
.PP
If the specified queue,
.IR q ,
is a normal read queue, then the returned back queue,
.IR bq ,
is the downstream queue.
If the specified queue,
.IR q ,
is a normal write queue, then the returned back queue,
.IR bq ,
is the upstream queue.
.PP
If the specified queue,
.IR q ,
is a FIFO read queue, then the returned back queue,
.IR bq ,
is the FIFO write queue.
If the specified queue,
.IR q ,
is a FIFO write queue, then the returned back queue,
.IR bq ,
is the FIFO read queue.
.PP
If the specified queue,
.IR q ,
is a pipe read queue, then the returned back queue,
.IR bq ,
is write queue at the other end of the pipe.
If the specified queue,
.IR q ,
is a pipe write queue, then the returned back queue,
.IR bq ,
is the read queue at the other end of the pipe.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR backq ()
returns the pointer to the resulting queue.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR backq ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR backq ()
returns
.B NULL
when the specified queue,
.IR q ,
is
.BR NULL ,
the pointer
.I q
is not a pointer to a queue structure,
or there is no upstream queue for a write queue or downstream queue for a read
queue.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS

will also return
.B NULL
if there is an internal error: that is, if the OTHER(q) pointer is
.BR NULL .
