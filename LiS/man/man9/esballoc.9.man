.TH ESBALLOC 9 "$Date: 2005/03/09 23:13:59 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.SH NAME
.B esballoc
\- allocate a \fISTREAMS\fR message and data block with a caller supplied data buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "mblk_t *" mp " = esballoc(unsigned char *" base ", int " size, ", int " priority ", frtn_t *" freeinfo );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ESBALLOC
is used where the
.IR STREAMS (4)
driver needs control over the location, allocation and deallocation of data
buffers.  This may be because the data buffers are subject to some physical
contraints (e.g. must be allocated in DMA-able memory, or must exist in
dual-ported RAM or in a decriptor ring).  This may also be because some other
mechanism outside of
.IR STREAMS (4)
has already allocated and passed the data buffer to a
.IR STREAMS (4)
driver.
.PP
Where it is not necessary that the caller provide the data buffer,
.BR allocb (9)
is more appropriate.
.PP
.B ESBALLOC
allocates a message block and a data block using the caller supplied data
buffer at
.I base
of the specified
.IR size " and " priority .
.PP
The
.I priority
can be one of the following values:
.TP 12
.B BPRI_LO
The caller requests a low priority message buffer.
.TP 12
.B BPRI_MED
The caller requests a medium priority message buffer.
.TP 12
.B BPRI_HI
The caller requests a high priority message buffer.
.PP
The data buffer of length
.I size
has already been allocated by the caller and is pointed to by the argument
.IR base .
In addition,
.B ESBALLOC
accepts a pointer to a
.B free_rtn
structure that contains the following elements:
.TP
.BI "void (*" free_func ")(char *)"
A function pointer
.I free_func
to a function returning void and taking a single character
pointer argument.  This function should perform whatever actions are necessary
to free the buffer pointed to by
.I base
in the call to
.BR ESBALLOC .
.TP
.BI "char *" free_arg
A character pointer argument
.I free_arg
that will be passed to a call to
.I free_func
when the message block returned by
.B ESBALLOC
is freed with
.BR freeb "(9) or " freemsg (9).
.PP
The allocated message block will have a data block type of
.BR M_DATA .
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
Upon success,
.B ESBALLOC
returns a pointer,
.IR mp ,
to the allocated message block.
.PP
Upon failure,
.B ESBALLOC
returns a
.B NULL
message pointer,
.IR mp .
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When an error occurs,
.BR ESBALLOC
will return a
.B NULL
message pointer,
.IR mp .
.PP
.BR ESBALLOC
will fail if
.I base
is
.BR NULL ,
or if
.I freeinfo
is
.BR NULL ,
or there is insufficient memory to allocate the necessary datastructures for
the message block or data block.
.PP
Failure to allocate a message block is typically followed by a call to
.BR esbbcall (9).
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
As with other post-SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
compliant
.IR STREAMS (4)
implementations,
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
ignores the
.I priority
argument to
.BR ESBALLOC .
The message block
.I priority
was an SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
concept which was found not to be useful, primarily due to
priority inversion.
For a history of the
.I priority
mechanism and a discussion as to why the mechanism was abandonned in SVR 4.2,
