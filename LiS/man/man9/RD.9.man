.TH RD 9 "$Date: 2005/03/09 23:13:58 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.SH NAME
.B RD
\- return the read queue of a \fISTREAMS\fR queue pair
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "queue_t *" rq " = RD(" q );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR RD ()
returns the read queue associated with the queue pair indicated by the queue
pointer
.IR q ,
regardless of whether
.I q
points to the read queue or the write queue of the queue pair.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR RD ()
returns a pointer to the read queue of the queue pair referenced by
.IR q .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR RD ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.PP
.BR RD ()
is typically and often used to find the read queue from a pointer to one of
the queues in a queue pair.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR RD ()
fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.BR RD ()
fails when the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.I q->q_other
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q->q_other
does not point to a valid queue structure.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
implements
.BR RD ()
as a function rather than as the more obvious
macro:
.sp
.nf
#define RD(__q) __q->q_flags & QREADR ? __q : __q->q_other
.fi
.PP
The
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
function call is inefficient, particularly as this function is called often
and regularly.
