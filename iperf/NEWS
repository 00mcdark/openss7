The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 IPERF Utility package as well as compatibility information of
OpenSS7 releases to the original `University of Illinois' releases.

 Major changes for release iperf-2.0.5.rc3
------------------------------------------

Third release candidate.  This is a "maintenance" release candidate.
This release candidate includes:

   * Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   * Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.

   * Changes made to the strsctp drivers at the `2006 SCTP Interop' at
     the `University of British Columbia'.  This version was
     interoperability tested with all implementations present.

   * Support for additional `SuSE' distributions on `ix86' as well as
     `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes `SLES 9', `SLES 9
     SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   * Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions.

   * Optimized compilation for user level programs.  New
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure'.

   * Now includes an `Installation and Reference Manual' (you are
     reading it).

This was an internal alpha test release candidate and was not released
publicly.  This release was only available to subscribers to and
sponsors of the OpenSS7 Project.

 Major changes for release iperf-2.0.5.rc2
------------------------------------------

Second release candidate.  This is a "maintenance" release candidate.
This release candidate includes:

   * Results of performance testing of the new second generation UDP
     driver (implemented completely in STREAMS instead of using an
     internal socket).

   * Support for SuSE 10.1.

This was an internal alpha test release candidate and was not released
publicly.  This release was only available to subscribers to and
sponsors of the OpenSS7 Project.

 Major changes for release iperf-2.0.5rc1
-----------------------------------------

Release candidate for Mark Fugate.  This is a "maintenance" release
candidate.  This release candidate includes:

   * Added `--enable-devel' configure option for embedded targets.

   * Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

This was an internal alpha test release candidate and was not released
publicly.  This release was only available to subscribers to and
sponsors of the OpenSS7 Project.

 Major changes for release iperf-2.0.4
--------------------------------------

Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
compiler warnings.

 Major changes for release iperf-2.0.3
--------------------------------------

Minor changes and bug fixes.  Still remaining to do is merge in the
latest upstream release of iperf.

 Initial public release iperf-2.0.2
-----------------------------------

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
RPM release numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian
release numbers will be _0.  If you wish to apply patches and relelease
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable
release suffix for your organization.  We leave Debian release number
_1 reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the
.dsc file.

 Initial release iperf-2.0.1-1
------------------------------

Initial autoconf/rpm packaging release of Iperf.

This is an autoconf/rpm release of Iperf suitable for use with OpenSS7
Linux Native SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol).  It is usable
for performance testing the SCTP application as well as supporting all
other Iperf TCP and UDP testing.

Not publicly released.
