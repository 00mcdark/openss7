 OpenSS7 IPERF Utility
======================

`OpenSS7 IPERF Utility' is a general purpose tool for measuring
bandwidth and performance of the `Internet Protocol' suite.  The
`OpenSS7 Modified OpenSS7 IPERF Utility' package is an OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org) release of the DAST `iperf' package configured
to run with `OpenSS7 Linux Native Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP)'.

This is a version of the "Iperf" package released by the `University of
Illinois' modified by the OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/) for
use with `OpenSS7 SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)'.  This
`OpenSS7' release of the package is based on the "Iperf-2.0.0" release
from the `University of Illinois'.

Modifications to the package are derived from the `OpenSS7 SCTP'
implementation and are released under the `GNU General Public License
(GPL) Version 2'.  The "Iperf" tool itself is licensed under specific
terms by the `University of Illinois'.  Please see `LICENSE' for the
`University of Illinois' "Iperf" copyright notices and licensing
restrictions.  The "Iperf" tool is:

     Copyright 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004

 Prerequisites
--------------

Prerequisites for the OpenSS7 IPERF Utility package are as follows:

  1. Linux distribution with a 2.4 kernel with the appropriate tool
     chain.  For supported and tested distributions, see the manual.

     (Note that although the original DAST Iperf builds and installs on
     a number of operating systems, the OpenSS7 modified version only
     currently builds and installs on Linux.)

        - A fairly LSB compliant GNU/Linux distribution.  (1)

        - Linux 2.4 kernel (2.4.10 - 2.4.27)

        - glibc2 or better.

        - GNU info (for info files).

        - GNU groff (for man pages).  (2)

  2. The `OpenSS7 Linux Native SCTP' (sctp-0.2.24.rc3.tar.bz2 or
     better).

When configuring and building multiple `OpenSS7 Project' release
packages, place all of the source packages (unpacked tarballs) at the
same directory level and all build directories at the same directory
level.

When installing packages that install as kernel modules, it is
necessary to have the correct kernel development package installed.
For the following distributions, use the following commands:

     Ubuntu:  $> apt-get install linux-headers
     Debain:  $> apt-get install kernel-headers
     Fedora:  $> yum install kernel-devel

You also need the same version of gcc compiple with which the kernel was
built.  If it is not the default, add `CC=kgcc' on the line after
`./configure', for example:

     $> ../iperf-2.0.5.rc3/configure CC='gcc-3.4'

 Installation
-------------

The following commands will download, configure, build, check, install,
validate, uninstall and remove the package:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/iperf-2.0.5.rc3.tar.bz2
     $> tar -xjvf iperf-2.0.5.rc3.tar.bz2
     $> mkdir build
     $> pushd build
     $> ../iperf-2.0.5.rc3/configure --enable-autotest
     $> make
     $> make check
     $> sudo make install
     $> sudo make installcheck
     $> sudo make uninstall
     $> popd
     $> sudo rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf iperf-2.0.5.rc3
     $> rm -f iperf-2.0.5.rc3.tar.bz2

If you have problems, try building with the logging targets instead.
If the make of a logging target fails, an automatic problem report will
be generated that can be mailed to The OpenSS7 Project
(mailto:bugs@openss7.org).  Installation steps using the logging
targets proceed as follows:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/iperf-2.0.5.rc3.tar.bz2
     $> tar -xjvf iperf-2.0.5.rc3.tar.bz2
     $> mkdir build
     $> pushd build
     $> ../iperf-2.0.5.rc3/configure --enable-autotest
     $> make compile.log
     $> make check.log
     $> sudo make install.log
     $> sudo make installcheck.log
     $> sudo make uninstall.log
     $> popd
     $> sudo rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf iperf-2.0.5.rc3
     $> rm -f iperf-2.0.5.rc3.tar.bz2

See `README-make' for additional specialized make targets.

For custom applications, see the `INSTALL' and `INSTALL-iperf' files or
the `Installation and Reference Manual' as listed below.  If you
encounter troubles, see the trouble shooting section of the
`Installation and Reference Manual' before issuing a bug report.

 Brief Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

The OpenSS7 IPERF Utility package is available from the downloads area
of The OpenSS7 Project website (http://www.openss7.org/download.html)
using a command such as:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/iperf-2.0.5.rc3.tar.bz2

Unpack the tarball using a command such as:

     $> tar -xjvf iperf-2.0.5.rc3.tar.bz2

The tarball will unpack into the relative subdirectory named after the
package name: iperf-2.0.5.rc3.

The package builds using the GNU `autoconf' utilities and the
`configure' script.  To build the package, we recommend using a separate
`build' directory as follows:

     $> mkdir build
     $> cd build
     $> ../iperf-2.0.5.rc3/configure

In general, the package configures and builds without adding any special
options to the `configure' script.  For general options to the
`configure' script, see the GNU `INSTALL' file in the distribution:

     $> less ../iperf-2.0.5.rc3/INSTALL

For specific options to the `configure' script, see the `INSTALL-iperf'
file in the distribution, or simply execute the configure script with
the `--help' option like so:

     $> ../iperf-2.0.5.rc3/configure --help

After configuring the package, the package can be compiled simply by
issuing the `make' command:

     $> make

Some specialized makefile targets exists, see the `README-make' file in
the distribution or simply invoke the `help' target like so:

     $> make help | less

After successfully building the package, the package can be checked by
invoking the `check' make target like so:

     $> make check

After succesffully checking the package, the package can be installed by
invoking the `install' make target (as root) like so:

     $> sudo make install

The testsuites that ship with the package can be invoked after the
package has been installed by invoking the `installcheck' target.  This
target can either be invoked as root, or as a normal user, like so:

     $> make installcheck

(Note: you must add the `--enable-autotest' flag to `configure', above
for the testsuites to be invoked with `make installcheck'.)

The package can be cleanly removed by invoking the `uninstall' target
(as root):

     $> sudo make uninstall

Then the build directory and tarball can be simply removed:

     $> cd ..
     $> rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf iperf-2.0.5.rc3
     $> rm -f iperf-2.0.5.rc3.tar.bz2

 Detailed Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the
`Installation and Reference Manual', contained in the distribution in
`text', `info', `html' and `pdf' formats:

     $> cd ../iperf-2.0.5.rc3
     $> less doc/manual/iperf.txt
     $> lynx doc/manual/iperf.html
     $> info doc/manual/iperf.info
     $> xpdf doc/manual/iperf.pdf

The `text' version of the manual is always available in the `MANUAL'
file in the release.

The current manual is also always available online from `The OpenSS7
Project' website at:

     $> lynx http://www.openss7.org/iperf_manual.html

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) *Note GNU/Linux Distributions::, for more information.

(2) If you are using a Debian release, please make sure to install the
groff extension package (`groff_ext'), as it contains the `refer' or
`grefer' commands necessary for including references in the manual
pages.
