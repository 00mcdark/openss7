Things to do:

   - Write a texinfo manual for Iperf.

     _*done*_

     You are reading it.

   - Merge upstream changes from the latest `University of Illinois'
     release of the `Iperf' package into the `OpenSS7 Modified'
     version.  It would really like to do this but don't have the time
     for it right now.  If someone is willing to dive in and give this
     a try, send me the patches.

   - `Iperf' is capable of performing performance testing on `lksctp' as
     well.  I would like to modify the `OpenSS7' version of `Iperf' to
     support both so that performance comparison testing can be done
     between `lkstcp' (which sucks of course) and `OpenSS7'.
