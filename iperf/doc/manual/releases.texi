This is the OpenSS7 Release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package, modified for use with OpenSS7
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Linux Native Kernel.

The purpose of providing a separate release of this package was to provide support for SCTP as well
as providing the ability to use GNU autoconf tools for maintenance and binary RPM release of the
package.

The following sections provide information on @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} releases as well as
compatibility information of OpenSS7 release to the original UI DAST releases of the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package.

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is currently compatible with
@cite{Linux STREAMS},@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use it.}
however, to use the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package with @cite{LiS} requires use of the OpenSS7
release packages of @cite{LiS}.
The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is compatible with the OpenSS7 @b{LiS-@value{VERSION_LIS}} release that
is available from the @url{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, The OpenSS7 Project Downloads
Page}.
But, do not use @cite{LiS}: it is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Use @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}
instead.

This section addresses compatibility issues between @cite{OpenSS7} and @cite{University of Illinois
DAST} releases of @cite{@value{PACKAGE}}.

@subsubheading @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION} and Iperf Compatibility

OpenSS7 modifications to support SCTP does not alter the data structures nor fundamental operation.
New structures and test definitions have been added for SCTP that are largely consistent with those
of TCP.

Specifically, an @cite{iperf-2.0} client should be able to connect and perform tests with an
@cite{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} server.  Also, an @cite{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}}
client should be able to connect and perform tests (other than SCTP) with an @cite{iperf-2.0}
server.

@subsubheading @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION} and Option Compatibility

OpenSS7 releases provide all options compiled-in to the program.  This obviates the need
for editing makefiles and recompiling the program from source as is described in the
@cite{University of Illinois DAST} documentation.  Additional options were provided to support SCTP.

@subsubheading @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION} and SCTP Compatibility

SCTP API tests are (likely) only compatible with the @cite{OpenSS7 Sockets} implementations of SCTP.
The reason for this is that the @cite{OpenSS7 Sockets} implementations use the POSIX standard socket
API rather than the non-standard socket API described in documents such as
@cite{draft-stewart-tsvwg-sctpsocket-xx.txt}.

@node Pre-Alpha Releases
@subsection Pre-Alpha Releases

@dfn{Pre-alpha} releases are releases that have received no testing whatsoever.  Code in the release
is not even known to configure or compile.  The purpose of a pre-alpha release is to make code and
documentation available for inspection only, and to solicit comments on the design approach or other
characteristics of the software package.

@dfn{Pre-alpha} release packages ship containing warnings recommending that the user not even
execute the contained code.

@node Alpha Releases
@subsection Alpha Releases

@dfn{Alpha} releases are releases that have received little to no testing, or that have been tested
and contains known bugs or defects that make the package unsuitable even for testing.  The purpose
for an @dfn{alpha} release are the same as for the pre-alpha release, with the additional purpose
that it is an early release of partially functional code that has problems that an external
developer might be willing to fix themselves and contribute back to the project.

@dfn{Alpha} release packages ship containing warnings that executing the code can crash machines and
might possibly do damage to systems upon which it is executed.

@node Beta Releases
@subsection Beta Releases

@dfn{Beta} releases are releases that have received some testing, but the testing to date is not
exhaustive.  @dfn{Beta} release packages do not ship with known defects.  All known defects are
resolved before distribution; however, as exhaustive testing has not been performed, unknown
defects may exist.  The purpose for a @dfn{beta} release is to provide a baseline for other
organizations to participate in the rigorous testing of the package.

@dfn{Beta} release packages ship containing warnings that the package has not been exhaustively
tested and that the package may cause systems to crash.  Suitability of software in this category
for production use is not advised by the project; however, as always, is at the discretion of the
user of the software.

@node Gamma Releases
@subsection Gamma Releases

@dfn{Gamma} releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project, but
external testing has been minimal.  @dfn{Gamma} release packages do not ship with known defects.  As
exhaustive internal testing has been performed, unknown defects should be few.  Please remember that
there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Gamma} release packages typically resolve problems in previous @dfn{beta} releases, and might
not have had full regression testing performed.  Suitability of software in this category for
production use is at the discretion of the user of the software.   @dfn{The OpenSS7 Project}
recommends that the complete validation test suites provided with the package be performed and pass
on target systems before considering production use.

@node Production Releases
@subsection Production Releases

@dfn{Production} releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project and
validated on specific distributions and architectures.  @dfn{Production} release packages do not
ship with known defects.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Production} packages ship containing a list of validated distributions and architectures.
Full regression testing of any maintenance changes is performed.  Suitability of software in this
category for production use on the specified target distributions and architectures is at the
discretion of the user.  It should not be necessary to preform validation tests on the set of
supported target systems before considering production use.

@node Unstable Releases
@subsection Unstable Releases

@dfn{Unstable} releases are releases that have received extensive testing within the project and
validated on a a wide range of distributions and architectures; however, is has tested unstable and
found to be suffering from critical problems and issues that cannot be resolved.  Maintenance of the
package has proved impossible.  @dfn{Unstable} release packages ship with known defects (and loud
warnings).  Suitability of software in this category for production use is at the discretion of the
user of the software.  @dfn{The OpenSS7 Project} recommends that the problems and issues be closely
examined before this software is used even in a non-production environment.  Each failing test
scenario should be completely avoided by the application.  @cite{OpenSS7} beta software is more
stable that software in this category.

@node Known Defects

@cindex bugs, known

With the exception of packages not originally created by the @cite{OpenSS7 Project}, the
@cite{OpenSS7 Project} software does not ship with known bugs in any release stage except
@dfn{pre-alpha}.  @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} had no known bugs at the time of release.

Nevertheless, the @cite{OpenSS7 Project} does not validate the @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package,
but simply uses it for benchmark performance testing.  Following are some of the expected
difficulties with the package that have not yet been discovered:

@enumerate
@item
No bug fixes from the original Iperf development stream have been rolled back into this release.
Therefore, any bugs reported on the regular Iperf release package probably still exist unfixed in
this release package.
@end enumerate

@cindex history bugs
@cindex bugs, history

This section contains historical bugs that were encountered during development
and their resolutions.  This list serves two purposes:

@enumerate 1
@item
It captures bugs encountered between releases during development that could possibly reoccur (and
the Moon is made of blue cheese).  It therefore provides a place for users to look if they encounter
a problem.

@item
It provides a low overhead bug list between releases for developers to use as a @file{TODO} list.
