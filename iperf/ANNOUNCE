iperf 2.0.4 was released under GPLv2 and UI license on March 15, 2006.

The iperf package is an OpenSS7 release of the University of Illinois
DAST Internet performance test tool configured to run with the OpenSS7
Linux Native Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

This is the OpenSS7 Project's fourth release of the University of
Illinois 'iperf' package, modified to work with the OpenSS7 Linux Native
(Sockets) implementation of SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol -
RFC 2960).  This package contains all of the necessary manual pages and
files, and configures and installs against almost any 2.4 kernel, even
production kernels.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's fourth release of the 'iperf' package
modified for OpenSS7 SCTP.  This is the package that was used to perform
the performance tests shown at <http://www.openss7.org/sctp_perf.html>.

This release provides corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean
compile and test runs on x86_64 architecture.  It also includes some bug
corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler warnings.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2' and
UI license (see the 'LICENSE' release file for more information).  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the iperf package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/iperf_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/iperf-2.0.4/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/iperf-2.0.4/NEWS> in the release for
more information.
