Package iperf-2.0.5 was released 2007-01-08.

Iperf is a general purpose tool for measuring bandwidth and performance
of the Internet Protocol suite.  The OpenSS7 Modified OpenSS7 IPERF
Utility package is an OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/) release
of the DAST `iperf' package configured to run with OpenSS7 Linux Native
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

The OpenSS7 IPERF Utility package provides primarily the iperf(1), C++
Language program that acts as either an Iperf server or client for
testing connections and networking.  The iperf(1) program is executed on
one host in server mode and then executed on another host in client
mode.  Characteristics of the connection or association can be altered
when formed.  Reporting formats and sample intervals can also be altered
when the connection or association is formed.

This is a fork of the Iperf package released by the University of
Illinois modified by the OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/) for
use with OpenSS7 SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol).  This
OpenSS7 release of the package is based on the Iperf-2.0.0 release from
the University of Illinois.

Modifications to the package are derived from the OpenSS7 SCTP
implementation and are released under the `GNU General Public License
(GPL) Version 2'.  The Iperf tool itself is licensed under specific
terms by the University of Illinois.  Please see LICENSES for the
University of Illinois Iperf copyright notices and licensing
restrictions.

This is the fifth full release of the OpenSS7 IPERF Utility package.
This is a stable, production grade release: it deprecates previous
releases.  Please upgrade to the most current release before reporting
bugs.

This release is largely a maintenance release that provides support for
more distributions an architectures as well as tracking feature updates
on related packages (i.e. sctp-0.2.24).

Additional features include:

   - Added `send-pr' scripts for automatic problem report generation.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure run-time targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.  j

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2' as well as the University of Illinois license (see LICENSE in
the release for more information).  The release is available as an
autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the
downloads page (http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf
tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and
DEBs, see the iperf package page
(http://www.openss7.org/iperf_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/iperf-2.0.5/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/iperf-2.0.5/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `iperf.pdf' manual in the release (also

by the University of Illinois.  Please see LICENSES for the University
of Illinois Iperf copyright notices and licensing restrictions.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's sixth release of the University of
Illinois iperf package, modified to work with the OpenSS7 Linux Native
(Sockets) implementation of SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol
- RFC 2960).  This package contains all of the necessary manual pages
and files, and configures and installs against almost any 2.4 kernel,
even production kernels.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's sixth release of the iperf package
modified for OpenSS7 SCTP.  This is the package that was used to perform
the performance tests shown here.

This release is largely a maintenance release that provides support for
more distributions an architectures as well as tracking feature updates
on related packages (i.e.  sctp-0.2.25).

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

 - Support for autoconf 2.61 and gettext 0.16.

 - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kernels.

 - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as
   unpacked by separate tarball.

This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 RPM- and
DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels without
patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2' as well as the University of Illinois license (see LICENSE in
the release for more information).  The release is available as an
autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the
downloads page (http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf
tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and
DEBs, see the iperf package page
(http://www.openss7.org/iperf_pkg.html).
