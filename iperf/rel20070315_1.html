OpenSS7 today announced Release 2.0.6 of the OpenSS7-modified <em>iperf</em> package.

<& SELF:abstract &>
Iperf is a general purpose tool for measuring bandwidth and performance of the Internet Protocol
suite.  The OpenSS7 Modified OpenSS7 IPERF Utility package is an OpenSS7 Project release of the DAST
iperf package configured to run with OpenSS7 Linux Native Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP).
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The OpenSS7 IPERF Utility package provides primarily the <a href="man2html?1+iperf">iperf(1)</a>,
C++ Language program that acts as either an Iperf server or client for testing connections and
networking.  The <a href="man2html?1+iperf">iperf(1)</a> program is executed on one host in server
mode and then executed on another host in client mode.  Characteristics of the connection or
association can be altered when formed.  Reporting formats and sample intervals can also be altered
when the connection or association is formed.

This is a fork of the "Iperf" package released by the University of Illinois modified by the OpenSS7
