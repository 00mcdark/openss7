This is the OpenSS7 Project's fifth release of the University of Illinois <em>iperf</em> package,
modified to work with the OpenSS7 Linux Native (Sockets) implementation of SCTP (Stream Control
Transmission Protocol - RFC 2960).  This package contains all of the necessary manual pages and
files, and configures and installs against almost any 2.4 kernel, even production kernels.<bdo/>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This is the OpenSS7 Project's fifth release of the <em>iperf</em> package modified for OpenSS7 SCTP.
This is the package that was used to perform the performance tests shown <a
href="sctp_perf.html">here</a>.<bdo/>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is largely a maintenance release that provides support for more distributions an
architectures as well as tracking feature updates on related packages (i.e. sctp-0.2.24).<bdo/>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Additional features supported in all packages (see master package release notes).</li>
<!--
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new - -with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added - -disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 2.0.5 of the OpenSS7-modified <em>iperf</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
Iperf is a general purpose tool for measuring bandwidth and performance of the Internet Protocol
suite.  The OpenSS7 Modified OpenSS7 IPERF Utility package is an OpenSS7 Project release of the DAST
iperf package configured to run with OpenSS7 Linux Native Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP).
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The OpenSS7 IPERF Utility package provides primarily the <a href="man2html?1+iperf">iperf(1)</a>,
C++ Language program that acts as either an Iperf server or client for testing connections and
networking.  The <a href="man2html?1+iperf">iperf(1)</a> program is executed on one host in server
mode and then executed on another host in client mode.  Characteristics of the connection or
association can be altered when formed.  Reporting formats and sample intervals can also be altered
when the connection or association is formed.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This is a fork of the Iperf package released by the University of Illinois modified by the OpenSS7
Project for use with OpenSS7 SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol).  This OpenSS7 release of
the package is based on the Iperf-2.0.0 release from the University of Illinois.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
