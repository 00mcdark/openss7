.SH DESCRIPTION

.SS "Open and Close Routines"

.SS "Write-Side Processing"
.PP
The
.B ldterm
module support the following input-output controls:
.BR TCSETA ,
.BR TCSETAW ,
.BR TCSETAF ,
.BR TCSETS ,
.BR TCSETSW ,
.BR TCSETSF ,
.BR TCGETA ,
.BR TCGETS ,
.BR TCXONC ,
.BR TCFLSH ,
.BR TCSKBR ,
.BR TIOCSWINSZ ,
.BR TIOCGWINSZ " and "
.BR JWINSIZE .
.PP
All input-output controls not recognized by the ldterm module are passes
downstream to the neighboring module 
.RB ( ptem (4)) 
or driver
.RB ( tty (4)).
.I BSD
functionality is turned off by
.B IEXTEN .
.PP
The following messages can be received on the write-side:
.BR M_DATA (9),
.BR M_DELAY (9),
.BR M_BREAK (9),
.BR M_FLUSH (9),
.BR M_STOP (9),
.BR M_START (9),
.BR M_STOPI (9),
.BR M_STARTI (9),
.BR M_READ (9),
.BR M_IOCDATA(9) ,
.BR M_CTL "(9) and "
.BR M_IOCTL (9).
.PP
On the write-side, the
.B ldterm
module processes
.BR M_FLUSH (9),
.BR M_DATA (9),
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
and
.BR M_READ (9)
mesages.  All other messages are passed downstream unchanged.
.PP
On the write-side,
.B ldterm
generates an
.BR M_CTL (9)
message as a query to the driver for an intelligent peripheral to decide on
the functional split for
.BR termio (7)
processing.  If all or part of
.BR termio (7)
processing is done by the intelligent peripheral,
.B ldterm
can turn off this processing to avoid computational overhead.  This is done by
sending an appropriate response to the
.BR M_CTL (9)
message, as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
If all of the
.BR termio (7)
processing is done by the peripheral hardware, the driver sends an
.BR M_CTL (9)
message back to
.B ldterm
with
.I ioc_cmd
of the
structure
.BR iocblk (9)
set to
.BR MC_NO_CANON .
If
.B ldterm is to handle all
.BR termio (7)
processing, the device driver sends an
.BR M_CTL (9)
message with
.I ioc_cmd
set to
.BR MC_DO_CANNON .
The default is
.BR MC_DO_CANNON .
.IP \(bu
If the peripheral harware handles only part of the
.BR termio (7)
processing, it informs
.B ldterm
in the following way: the driver for the peripheral device allocate an
.BR M_DATA (9)
message large enough to hold a
.BR termios (5)
structure.  The driver then turns on those
.IR c_iflag ,
.IR c_oflag ,
and
.IR c_lflag ,
fields of the
.BR termios (5)
structure that are processed on the peripheral device by ORing the flag
values.  The
.BR M_DATA (9)
message is then attached to the
.I b_cont
field of the
.BR M_CTL (9)
message it received.  The message is sent back to
.B ldterm
with
.I ioc_cmd
in the data buffer of the
.BR M_CTL (9)
message set to
.BR MC_PART_CANON .
.PP
The line discipline module does not check if write-side flow control is in
effect before forwarding data downstream.  It expects the downstream module or
driver to queue the messages on its queue until flow control is lifted.
