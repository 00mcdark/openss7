.SH NAME
.B unlockpt
\- unlock a slave pseudo-terminal device
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.\".B #include <sys/ptms.h>
.\".br
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.HP
.BI "int unlockpt(int " fd );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
The file descriptor of a master pseudo-terminal device successfully acquired
by opening the
.B /dev/ptmx
device.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR unlockpt ()
subroutine unlocks the slave pseudo-terminal device of the corresponding master pseudo-terminal
device specified by
.IR fd .
Portable applications must call
.BR unlockpt ()
before opening the slave side of a pseudo-terminal device.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
When a master pseudo-terminal device,
.BR ptmx (4),
is opened with a call to
.BR open (2s),
it returns an available master pseudo-terminal device.  As part of the
.BR open (2s),
call processing, the master pseudo-terminal driver,
.BR ptm (4),
automatically locks out both the master and the slave pseudo-terminal driver from subsequent
.BR open (2s)
calls.
.PP
The owner of the master
.BR pty (4)
can then establish appropriate permissions for the slave device using the
.BR grantpt (3)
subroutine, before unlocking the slave to be opened with
.BR unlockpt ().
.PP
The master pseudo-terminal device remains locked.  That is, no other process can open the
pseudo-terminal device,
.IR "including the process holding the device open" ,
once it has already been opened.
.BR unlockpt ()
only unlocks the slave pseudo-terminal device.
.PP
As can be deduced from this procedure, the primary intention of the procedure is one of security.
Other processes are not even afforded a narrow window within which to open the slave pseudo-device
terminal.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR unlockpt (3)
is implemented using the
.BR UNLKPT
intput-output control for master pseudo-terminal devices,
.BR pty (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR unlockpt ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
upon failure,
minus one
.RB ( -1 ).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR unlockpt ()
fails, it returns minus one
.BR ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBEINVAL\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EBADF ]
The
.I fd
argument is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The
.I fd
argument is not associated with a master pseudo-terminal device.
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
The corresponding slave pseudo-terminal device could not be accessed.
.PP
In addition, any other error number returned by
.BR ioctl (2s)
could be returned by
.BR grantpt ().
