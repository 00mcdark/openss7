This is the first separate release from The OpenSS7 Project of the OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals
package.  This package provides pts and ptm pseudo-terminal drivers, as well as an ldterm module.
Additional modules are the ptem, ttcompat and pckt modules.  The package contains all the necessary
manual pages and other documentation for terminal and pseudo-terminal components in a separate
autoconf tarball.

This release is the initial public release.
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>In this inital release, the package already supports a wide range of production distributions as
it uses the same build environment as other OpenSS7 Project packages.</li>
<li>Additional features supported in all packages (see master package release notes).</li>
<!--
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new - -with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added - -disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.1 of the STREAMS Terminals (TTY) <em>strtty</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package provides STREAMS modules and drivers, libraries, programs,
init scripts, and daemons that implement the classical SVR 4 Terminal Subsystem.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules,
libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the development and
execution of OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals components and applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS
environment.  It provides true STREAMS-based Pseudo-Terminals for Linux.

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
