strtty-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package provides STREAMS modules and
drivers, libraries, programs, init scripts, and daemons that implement
the classical SVR 4 Terminal Subsystem.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS Terminals components and applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS
environment.  It provides true STREAMS-based Pseudo-Terminals for Linux.

This is the first separate release from The OpenSS7 Project of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package.  This package provides pts and ptm
pseudo-terminal drivers, as well as an ldterm module.  Additional
modules are the ptem, ttcompat and pckt modules.  The package contains
all the necessary manual pages and other documentation for terminal and
pseudo-terminal components in a separate autoconf tarball.

This release is the initial public release.

   * In this inital release, the package already supports a wide range
     of production distributions as it uses the same build environment
     as other OpenSS7 Project packages.

   * Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

  This is the inital public alpha release of the package.  This
  package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
  reference point for the community.  If you are interested in
  completion of this package, contact <info@openss7.com>.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strtty package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strtty_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strtty-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strtty-0.9.2.1/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strtty.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strtty_manual.html>).
