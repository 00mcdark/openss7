This is the third open source release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS VOIP package.  This release
contains modules and drivers formerly only available with Commercial releases of the <tt>strss7</tt>
package and which are only recently available as open source with the release of this package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
With OpenSS7 Master Package release openss7-0.9.2.D, the VOIP components were
separated from the <tt>strss7</tt> package and placed in this package.  Not all of the VOIP components
previously part of the <tt>strss7</tt> package have been strapped into this release.  Components will be
re-validated against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module and driver-by-driver basis.  See
<a href="codefiles/strvoip-0.9.2.3/TODO">TODO</a> in the release, or <em>Schedule</em>, in the
manual, for information about the release schedule.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The major component first available is H.323 call control.  h323(4) is a STREAMS multiplexing driver
that links tcp(4) or sctp(4) streams to form an H.323 Gatekeeper.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Subsequent releases in 3Q 2007 will include the additional full H.323, SIP-T and GCP
drivers with conformance test suites.
