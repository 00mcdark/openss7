.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
This is the
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ " ( @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ )
package for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[
lfs
.]
.PP
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" ,
.BR streams (5),
consists of a base package that provides basic
.I SVR 4.2 STREAMS
capabilities for
.B Linux
and a number of separate add-on packages.
.PP
OpenSS7
.I STREAMS
add-on packages provide additional functionality and protocol support not traditionally found on
UNIX systems, or which have traditionally fallen into the domain of value-add system software, or,
in this case, where functionality was optional or differently handled in a number of
implementations.
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is one of the several optional add-on packages that provide support for Voice over IP and is
part of the thrust of the
.IR "OpenSS7 Project" .

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package provides
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers, libraries, programs, init scripts, and daemons that
implement the
.I STREAMS
Voice over IP subsystem.
.PP
The package builds and installs the following
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers (as kernel modules):
.IP \(en \w'\(en\(em'u
.B streams_h245.ko
.PP
The following are
.I STREAMS
modules installed by the
.B @PACKAGE@
package:
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package includes kernel modules,
.I SVR 4.2 STREAMS
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the
development and execution of
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
protocol stack components and applications for the
.I SVR 4.2 STREAMS
environment.
.PP
This distribution is only currently applicable to
.B Linux
2.4 and 2.6 kernels and was targeted at
.IR ix86 ", " x86_64 ", " ppc " and " ppc64
architectures, but should build and install for other architectures as well.
.PP
This package represents VOIP components that were previously part of the
.BR strss7 (5)
package, but which were separated into this package at the end of 2006.  Although this manual page
documents all commercial components in the
.BR strvoip (5)
package, not all components have been released publicly.

.IR "OpenSS7 Master Package" ,
.BR openss7 (5).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Although previous releases of the
.B @PACKAGE@
package were tested with
.IR LiS ,
.I LiS
is now deprecated and this release
.RB ( @VERSION@ )
of
.B @PACKAGE@
has not been tested with
.IR LiS .
.I The OpenSS7 Project
will no longer support this package for
.IR LiS :
please upgrade to
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.PP
.I Production
releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project
and validated on specific distributions and architectures.
.I Production
release packages do not ship with known defects.  Please remember that there
is
.B NO WARRANTY
on public release packages.
.PP
.I Production
packages ship containing a list of validated distributions and architectures.
Full regression testing of any maintenance changes is performed.  Suitability
of software in this category for production use on the specified target
distributions and architecturs is at the discretion of the user.  It should
not be necessary to perform validation tests on the set of supported target
systems before considering production use.
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
could possibly contain unknown defects.  This is a
.I production
release.  Nevertheless, some remaining unknown defects could possibly be
harmful.  Validation testing has been performed by the
.I OpenSS7 Project
and external entities on this software for the set of systems listed in the
release notes.  Nevertheless, the software might still fail to configure or
compile on other systems.  The
.I OpenSS7 Project
recommends that you validate this software for your target system before using
this software.  Use at your own risk.  Remember that there is
.BR "NO WARRANTY" .
(See the section
.RI \(lq "NO WARRANTY" \(rq
under the
.RI \(lq "GNU General Public License" ,
in the manual.)
.PP
This software is
.I production
software.  As such, it is stable on validated systems but might still crash
your kernel in unique circumstances.  Installation of the software on a
non-validated distribution might mangel your header files or Linux
distribution in such a way as to make it unusable and rebooting the system
might not repair the problem.  You could possibly lose all the data on your
system.  Because this software stands a chance of crashing your kernel, the
resulting unstable system could possibly destroy computer hardware or
peripherals making them unusable.  You might void the warranty on any system
on which you run this fotware.

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE@
package has been tested with a wide array of production
.B Linux
distributions, kernels, and target architectures, and is considered production
grade by
.IR "The OpenSS7 Project" .
At the time of release, the
.B @PACKAGE@
package had no known bugs.  Problems can be reported to
.RB < bugs@openss7.org >.
Please, however, use the included
.B send-pr
script for generating actionable problem reports.  Please see the file
.RI \(lq PROBLEMS \(rq
in the release for problem reporting guidelines.

.BR VOIP (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
Application programming interfaces for VOIP and other modules
and drivers have not been standardized by a formal standards body.  For the
most part, VOIP implementations have used proprietary interfaces for accessing
the various protocol layers of the VOIP stack.
.PP
The
.I OpenSS7 Project
also uses project-specific (but open) interfaces at a number of layers where a standard
is lacking.  Nevertheless, standard service interfaces are used for a number of
layers in the ISDN components and even in the upper level VOIP components.
These standardized service interfaces are based on the
Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.BR cdi (7),
the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
the Transport Provider Interface (TPI),
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
and the Call Control Interface (CCI),
.BR cci (7).
.PP
.I OpenSS7 Project
VOIP components use the same interfaces as are provided for use by SS7/ISDN
components at the same protocol level.  This makes
.I OpenSS7 Project
VOIP components automatically compatible with OpenSS7 SS7
and ISDN components.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
In general, there are few conformance specifications to which to test VOIP
components.  Nevertheless, a few exist as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
.IP \(bu
.PP
For additional description of conformance and validation test suites and the
standards to which the tests are performed, see the manual page for the
appropriate protocol driver or module.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The contents of the
.B @PACKAGE@
package were formerly part of the
.BR strss7 (5)
package.  As of
.BR "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" ,
the VOIP components were moved out of the
.BR strss7 (5)
package into this
.BR strvoip (5)
package.  This package now contains all of the VOIP components released by
.IR "The OpenSS7 Project" ,
along with associated documentation.
.PP
In the initial releases of the
.BR strvoip (5)
package, only VOIP modules and drivers that have been fully revalidated on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
were initially released.  The remaining components present on the CVS archive and formerly part of the commercial
.BR strss7 (5)
releases, will be publicly released in releases subsequent to
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
as they are revalidated.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATUS
.PP
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package is
.I production
grade on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
for the modules and drivers included in the public release.  Not all OpenSS7
project VOIP modules and drivers have been included in the release
distribution.  The OpenSS7 Project is in the process of revalidating all
package modules and drivers for use on
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
As a result, additional release components will be strapped into the package
once full validation test suites are developed and run against each
component.
.PP
In particular, the following modules and drivers are currently missing from
the public release:
