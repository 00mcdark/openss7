Package strvoip-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS VOIP package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS VOIP applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, sponsor the OpenSS7 Project.  To sponsor the project,
contact <info@openss7.com>.

This is the initial open source release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS VOIP
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which are
only recently available as open source with the release of this package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release openss7-0.9.2.D, the VOIP components
were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this package.
Not all of the VOIP components previously part of the `strss7' package
have been strapped into this release.  Components will be re-validated
against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module and driver-by-driver
basis.  See TODO in the release, or `Schedule', in the manual, for
information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is H.323
call control.  h323(4) is a STREAMS multiplexing driver that links
tcp(4) or sctp(4) streams to form an H.323 Gatekeeper.  Subsequent
releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full H.323, SIP-T and
GCP.

This is a beta grade release of H.323 for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  It
deprecates previous VOIP component releases from the `strss7' package.
Please upgrade to the most current release of these components before
reporting bugs.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

_This is the initial public beta release of the package: it deprecates
previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before
reporting bugs.  Please see README-alpha in the release, or `Maturity',
in the manual._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strvoip package page (http://www.openss7.org/strvoip_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strvoip-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strvoip-0.9.2.1/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `strvoip.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/strvoip_manual.html).

Package strvoip-0.9.2.2 was released under GPLv2 2007-03-15.

This release is the second separate release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS VOIP
package.  Some of the components in this package were formerly present
in the strss7 package.  Various networking drivers are provided as well
as CDI, DLPI, NPI, TPI and CCI header files for VOIP operation.  The
package contains the necessary manual pages and other documentation for
VOIP components in a separate autoconf tarball.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS VOIP package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS VOIP applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This is the second open source release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS VOIP
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only

only recently available as open source with the release of this package.

information about the release schedule.

The major component first available is H.323 call control.  h323(4) is a
STREAMS multiplexing driver that links tcp(4) or sctp(4) streams to form
an H.323 Gatekeeper.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full H.323,
SIP-T and GCP drivers with conformance test suites.

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, contact info@openss7.com.  This release is a
maintenance release providing support for recent distributions and tool
chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

 - Improvements to the common build environment with better support for
   standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

 - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

 - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.

 - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as
   unpacked by separate tarball.

This is a public beta release of the package: it deprecates previous
releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before reporting bugs.
Please see README-alpha in the release.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
