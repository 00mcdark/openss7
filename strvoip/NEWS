 Major changes for release strvoip-0.9.2.1
------------------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strvoip' release.

This is the initial open source release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS VOIP'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the VOIP
components were separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this
package.  Not all of the VOIP components previously part of the `strss7'
package have been strapped into this release.  Components will be
re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the release, or `Schedule', in
the manual, for information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is H.323
call control.  `h323(4)' is a "STREAMS" multiplexing driver that links `tcp(4)'
or `sctp(4)' streams to form an H.323 Gatekeeper.  Subsequent releases
in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full H.323, SIP-T and GCP.

This is a beta grade release of H.323 for `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.  It
deprecates previous VOIP component releases from the `strss7' package.
Please upgrade to the most current release of these components before
reporting bugs.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

_This is the initial public beta release of the package: it deprecates
previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before
reporting bugs.  Please see `README-alpha' in the release, or
`Maturity', in the manual._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM-based or dpkg-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs or DEBs.  See the download page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  See the strvoip package page
(http://www.openss7.org/strvoip_pkg.html) for tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and
binary RPMs or DEBs.
