.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.IR UNIX \(rg
has traditionally provided three components of the Network Services Library,
.BR libnsl ,
that are associated with Transport Provider Interface,
.BR tpi (7),
.IR STREAMS (9)
network pseudo-device drivers, and that are not currently part of the
.B Linux
Network Services Library.  These components are:
.IP 1. \w'1.\(em'u
Network Configuration database access, see
.BR netconfig (3).
.PD 0
.IP 2.
Network Configuration database Path access, see
.BR netpath (3).
.IP 3.
Network Directory Name and Address Service, see
.BR netdir (3).
.PD
.PP
These are often refered to as the Network Selection facility of the Network
Services Library.
.PP
.BR netdir_getbyname ()
provides a forward directory name service for the network transport protocol specified with a
pointer to a
.BR netconfig (5)
structure,
.IR config .
The
.I config
pointer is acquired using the
.BR getnetconfig (3),
.BR getnetconfigent (3)
or
.BR getnetpath (3)
subroutines and describes a particular transport protocol from the
.BR netconfig (5)
network configuration database.
The host and service name tuple to forward lookup is specified as a pointer to a
.B nd_hostserv
structure,
.IR service ,
that contains the host and service name tuple (the structure is described below).
.BR netdir_getbyname ()
returns into the pointer referenced by
.I addrs
a pointer to a
.B nd_addrlist
structure that contains the addresses associated with the name,
.IR service .
.PP
Once the
.B nd_addrlist
structure and the
.BR netbuf (3)
structures that it contains are no longer required, they are freed by passing a pointer to the
structure to
.BR netdir_free (3)
with a
.I struct_type
argument of
.BR ND_ADDRLIST .

Each address in the list pointed to by the

structure is formatted as a

structure.
The
.B netbuf
structure is defined in
.RB < xti.h >
and described in
.BR netbuf (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The procedure for use of the
.BR netdir_getbyname ()
subroutine is to first acquire a pointer to a
.BR netconfig (3)
structure representing an entry in the
.BR netconfig (5)
database using a function such as
.BR getnetconfig (3),
.BR getnetconfigent (3)
or
.BR getnetpath (3).
Then a host and service name tuple is placed in a
.B nd_hostserv
structure and passed to the
.BR netdir_getbyname ()
function.
The returned
.B nd_addrlist
structure pointer contains the address associated with the name.  Once the
.B nd_addrlist
structure is no longer required, it is freed with
.BR netdir_free (3)
with a
.I struct_type
argument of
.BR ND_ADDRLIST .
.PP
For Internet Protocol transports, (that is, when
.I config
points to a
.BR netconfig (5)
structure corresponding to an Internet Protocol Version 4 or Version 6 network),
.BR netdir_getbyname ()
is roughly equivalent to
.BR gethostbyname (3)
or
.BR getipnodebyname (3);
however,
.BR netdir_getbyname ()
is more general and applies to networks other than
.I inet
or
.IR inet6 .
Also,
.BR gethostbyname (3)
and
.BR getipnodebyname (3)
do not accept a service name, nor return a port number.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR netdir_getbyname ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 )
and places pointer to an allocated
.B nd_addrlist
structure in the pointer referenced by the
.I addrs
argument.
Otherwise, minus one
.RB ( -1 )
is returned and
.BR _nderror (3)
is set to indicate the error.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP

.BR netdir_getbyname ()
fails, it returns minus one
.RB ( -1 )

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that when the
.I h_serv
member of the
.B nd_hostserv
structure is specified as
.BR NULL ,
.BR netdir_getbyname ()
will attempt to formulate and return host-based addresses only.
.PP
.BR netdir_perror (3)
and
.BR netdir_sperror (3)
must be called immediately after the failed network configuration subroutine fails.  Otherwise, the
error condition in
.BR _nderror (3)
may be lost.
.PP
The pointer returned to the pointer referenced by the
.I addrs
argument must eventually be released by passing it to
.BR netdir_free (3)
with a
.I struct_type
argument of
.BR ND_ADDRLIST .
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Name to address lookup libraries that will have their
.BR _netdir_getbyname ()
dynamic symbols called to perform the lookup will be searched in the order that they appear in the
.I nc_lookups
member of the specified
.BR netconfig (5)
structure,
.IR config .
If
.I config
specifies an
.I inet
or
.I inet6
network, and the number of lookup libraries,
.IR nc_nlookups ,
is zero, the standard BSD inet lookup functions will be used.
.PP
.BR _netdir_getbyname ()
is the symbol provided by shared object lookup libraries to implement
.BR netdir_getbyname ().
If the library does not implement
.BR _netdir_getbyname (),
.BR netdir_getbyname ()
will fail, return minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and set
.BR _nderror (3)
to
.RB [ ND_NOSYM ].
