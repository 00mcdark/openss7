with @cite{Linux} kernel programming, the @cite{Linux} file system, character devices, driver input
and output, interrupts, software interrupt handling, scheduling, process contexts, multiprocessor
locks, administration, kernel dumps, crashes, oops logs, package managers, the autoconf packaging
system, etc.

The guide is intended for installers and maintainers of @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} software.

Readers of the guide are expected to possess prior knowledge of the @cite{Linux} and @cite{UNIX}
system, programming, networking, and data communication.

@node Objective
@chapter Objective
@cindex objective

@cite{UNIX@registeredsymbol{}} has traditionally provided three components of the Network Services
Library, @file{libnsl}, two of which are associated with the X/Open Transport Interface/Transport
Layer Interface (XTI/TLI), @manref{xti(3)}, the Transport Provider Interface (TPI), @manref{tpi(7)},
and @dfn{STREAMS} network pseudo-device drivers.  Two components provide the TI (Transport
Independent) interface, whereas the other provides the TS (Transport Sockets) interface.  The TI
components provide the Transport Independent RPC services (TI-RPC) pioneered by Sun Microsystems and
standardized by the IETF.

@cite{GNU/Linux glicb} provides (amoung other things) the RPC Interface Library and the TS-RPC and
BSD 4.3 socket address translation facilities in @file{libc}, and provides NIS capabilities in
@file{libnsl}.

@dfn{STREAMS}-related components that are not currently part of the @cite{Linux} Network Services
Library (@file{libnsl}) are:

@enumerate

@item Network Selection, consisting of:

@itemize @bullet

@item Network Configuration database access, @manref{netconfig(3)},

@item Network Path access, @manref{netpath(3)}.

@end itemize

@item Name-to-Address Translation, @manref{netdir(3)}.

@end enumerate

These are often collectively referred to as the Network Selection facility of the Network Services
Library.

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package provides a library, renamed @file{libxnsl}, that provides
the missing Network Selection and Name-to-Address mapping facilities designed to work with
@manref{xti(3)} from the @manref{strxnet(5)} package.

The objective for providing this library and missing capabilities was to provide a mechanism whereby
the @manref{strsock(5)} package and the @file{libsockets} library could set socket options
independent of transport provider.  As a secondary objective, this package could support a full port
of the TIRPCSRC 2.8 transport-independent RPC source to @cite{Linux} and also provide the
@command{rpcbind} service missing from @cite{Linux}.  This would also permit additional source such
as NFS 4 to be rapidly ported to @cite{Linux}.

Following are performance test programs:

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package does not yet contain any performance programs.  For
performance testing of various transport providers, see the @file{netperf-@value{VERSION_NETPERF}}
package.

@subsection Conformance Test Programs

Following are conformance and validation test programs included in the package:

@table @asis


@item @file{/usr/libexec/@value{PACKAGE}/testsuite}
@itemx @file{/usr/libexec/@value{PACKAGE}/atlocal}
The OpenSS7 Project style @command{autotest} test suite.  This test suite can be run stand-alone as
described under @refman{Running Test Suites}.  The @file{atlocal} file provides localized
definitions for the test suite.

@end table

For the proper way to execute these validation test programs in a conformance and validation test
suite, see @refman{Running Test Suites}.

@subsection Problem Report Scripts

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package installs customized problem reporting scripts for reporting
problems associated with test suite execution and other difficulties.  This problem reporting script
is installed in the @file{/usr/libexec/@value{PACKAGE}/} subdirectory as follows:

@table @asis

@item @file{/usr/libexec/@value{PACKAGE}/send-pr}
@itemx @file{/usr/libexec/@value{PACKAGE}/send-pr.config}
This is the problem reporting script tailored for the @file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}}
package.  The @file{send-pr} file is the script proper and the @file{send-pr.config} file contains
localized configuration information.

@end table

For more information on the use of the problem reporting scripts, see @refman{Generating Problem
Reports}.

@node Development
@chapter Development
@cindex developing

@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} provides all of the header files, shared object and static libraries,
manual pages and documentation necessary for the development of both user space applications
programs and kernel space @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers based on the package.  The sections that
follow describe these development facilities.

@menu
* Development Header Files::
* Static and Shared Libraries::
* Manual Pages::
@end menu

@node Development Header Files::
@section Header Files

Header files are installed, typically, in the @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}/} subdirectory.  To
use the header files from the package, @samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} must be included in the
@command{gcc} command line as a preprocessor option.

In general, @samp{-I} include preprocessor directives on the @command{gcc} command line should be
ordered in the reverse order of the dependencies between packages.  So, for example, if the include
files from all add-on packages are required, the order of these directives would be:
@samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strxns}
@samp{-I/usr/include/strcompat}
@samp{-I/usr/include/streams}.

Following are the user visible header files provided by the @file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}}
package in the directory @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}:

@table @file

@item sys/strnsl/config.h
@pgindex sys/strnsl/config.h
@pgindex /usr/include/strnsl/sys/strnsl/config.h
Configuration defines for the package.

@item sys/strnsl/version.h
@pgindex sys/strnsl/version.h
@pgindex /usr/include/strnsl/sys/strnsl/version.h
Module versions for the package (on 2.4 systems).

@item netconfig.h
@pgindex netconfig.h
@pgindex /usr/include/strnsl/netconfig.h
@itemx sys/netconfig.h
@pgindex sys/netconfig.h
@pgindex /usr/include/strnsl/sys/netconfig.h
Definitions for the network configuration database.

@item netdir.h
@pgindex netdir.h
@pgindex /usr/include/strnsl/netdir.h
Definitions for the name-to-address translation facilities.

@end table

@subsection User Space Programs

Typical include files for interacting with Transport providers from user space include the
@file{netconfig.h} or @cite{netdir.h} header files.  Additional header files for
interacting with specific drivers or modules may also be required.  The @cite{netconfig.h} header file 
is used for interacting with the Network Configuration database.  The @cite{netdir.h} header file is for interacting
with the Name-to-Address translation services.

@node Static and Shared Libraries
@section Libraries

Shared or static version of the @cite{libxnsl} library must be linked when using the
@file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package.  The library must either be specified on the
@command{gcc} command line as a shared library (e.g. @samp{-lxnsl}) or as a static library (e.g.
@samp{/usr/lib/libxnsl.a}).

If the shared object library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command
line:

@table @samp

@item -lxnsl
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libxnsl.so} shared library.

@end table

If the static library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command line:

@table @samp

@item /usr/lib/libxnsl.a
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libxnsl.a} static library.

@end table

@node Manual Pages
@section Manual Pages

The @file{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package installs a number of manual pages in the
@file{/usr/share/man} directory as follows:

The following manual pages are installed in Section 3 of the manual (in the subdirectory
@file{/usr/share/man/man3}):

@multitable @columnfractions .35 .65


@end multitable

The following manual pages are installed in Section 5 of the manual (in the subdirectory
@file{/usr/share/man/man5}):
