@subsubheading Current Plan

@subsubheading Things to Do

@itemize @bullet
@item
The package still needs to be internationalized.

@emph{*todo*}

@item
This implementation of the Network Selection facility and Name-to-Address mapping allows direct use
of TI-RPC for Linux.  The primary benefit of this is the ability to use TI-RPC code directly without
significant and thus support upper level services such as NFS Version 4.  Another amazing
possibility is to not only immediately run NFS Version 4, but also to run it over SCTP.  A todo item
is to take the TI-RPC 2.8 release and port it to Linux Fast-STREAMS.  This might best be approached
with a separate strrpc package, or addressed directly by this package.

@emph{*todo*}

@item
One of the primary purposes of providing this package for the OpenSS7 Project was to provide access
to the network configuration database and name-to-address translation functions for the purpose of
using primarily the name-to-address translation functions for SS7 and other telephony related
protocols, not for the purposes of supporting TI-RPC, but a way of providing common mechanisms.
Fortunately, most of the definitions are part of the transport provider implementation.

Provide a mechanism for implementations of transport protocols to add their definitions into the
@manref{netconfig(5)} database files.

@emph{*todo*}

@item
The texinfo manual, @file{libxnsl.texi}, is incomplete.  For the time being, the manual pages,
starting with @manref{libxnsl(3)}, are the definitive documentation.  It would be nice to also
provide these library manual pages as a printable manual, however, the project has not yet found the
time to complete this manual.

@emph{*todo*}

@item
This package is largely untested.  A conformance test suite and some test cases need to be written.

@emph{*todo*}
