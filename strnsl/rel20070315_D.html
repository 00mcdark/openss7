OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.2 of the STREAMS Network Services Library (NSL) <em>strnsl</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
UNIX has traditionally provided three components of the Network Services Library, <tt>libnsl</tt>,
two of which are associated with the X/Open Transport Interface/Transport Layer Interface (XTI/TLI),
<tt>libxnet</tt>, the Trasnport Provider Interface (TPI), and STREAMS network pseudo-device drivers.  Two
components provide the TI (Transport Independent) interface, whereas the other provides the TS
(Transport Sockets) interface.  The TI components provide the Transport Independent RPC services
(TI-RPC) pioneered by Sun Microsystems and subsequently standardized by the IETF.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
GNU/Linux <tt>glibc</tt> provides (amoungst other things) the RPC interface library and the TS-RPC
and BSD 4.3 sockets address translation facilities in <tt>libc</tt>, and provides NIS capabilities
in <tt>libnsl</tt>.  STREAMS related components that are not currently part of the Linux Network
Services Library
(<tt>libnsl</tt>) are:
</p><ol style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Network Selection, consisting of:</li>
<ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
    <li>Network Configuration database access, <a href="man/man2html?3+netconfig">netconfig(3)</a>, and,</li>
    <li>Network Path access, <a href="man/man2html?3+netpath">netpath(3)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Name-to-Address Translation, <a href="man/man2html?3+netdir">netdir(3)</a>.</li>
</ol><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
These are often referred to as the Network Selection facility of the Network Services Library.  The
<cite>OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library</cite> package provides a library, renamed <tt>libxnsl</tt>, that
provides the missing Network Selection and Name-to-Address mapping facilities designed to work with
<a href="man/man2html?3+xti">xti(3)</a>.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library package contains header files and the associated
documentation that were originally contained in the <tt>strxnet</tt> package.  This library was quickly
removed from the <tt>strxnet</tt> distribution and placed in its own add-on package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
