Things to do:

   * Need to remove the following functions:

     `t_sndopt(3)',
     `t_sndvopt(3)',
     `t_rcvopt(3)' and
     `t_rcvvopt(3)',

     as they are non-standard and non-portable.  Instead use the
     following functions:

     `t_sndudata(3)',
     `t_sndvudata(3)',
     `t_rcvudata(3)' and
     `t_rcvvudata(3)'.

     because they have precisely the same argument templates as the
     other.  These functions are described in the OpenGroup
     documentation as inapplicable to connection-oriented transports,
     however, we could releive that restriction for SCTP.  The
     characterstics to check is if T_CLTS, okay, T_COTS or T_COTS_ORD,
     only okay if the tsdu_size is not T_INVALID (as it is for TCP).
     (It would be ok to be T_INFINITE as it is for SCTP.)

     _*todo*_

     They may have already been removed.  Verify this.  They certainly
     have to be implemented this way yet.

   * The XTI/TLI library is now largely in maintenance mode.  Not much
     special development is planned.

   - Full ATM Support.  This is an item where the XTI implementation is
     lacking.  When we provide full TPI ATM support under the strss7
     package, then this item will be investigated.

     _*todo*_

   - Addition of a (unfortunately non-standard) send with options
     commands for SCTP.

     _*done*_

     Actually this was already done a long time ago.  See manual pages:

     `t_sndopt(3)',
     `t_sndvopt(3)',
     `t_rcvopt(3)' and
     `t_rcvvopt(3)'.

     Perhaps what needs to be done is to test them?
