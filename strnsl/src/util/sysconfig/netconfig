# Lines beginning with a '#' (after an arbitraty amount of whitespace)
# form a comment.  Blank lines (or lines consisting entirely of
# whitespace) are ignored.  Any other line consists of 7 whitespace
# separated fields described below.  Any information past the 7'th field
# is ignored.
#
# <netid>	A network identification string assigned by the local system
# 		administrator.  Typical names are: udp6, tcp, rawip,
# 		ticotsord, etc.
#
# <semantics>	The semantics of the trasnport provider service interface.
# 		This field can be one of:
#		
#		tpi_clts	Trasnport provider interface, connectionless
#				transport service.
#
#		tpi_cots	Transport provider interface, connection-
#				oriented transport service with abortive
#				release.
#
#		tpi_cots_ord	Transport provider interface, connection-
#				oriented transport service with orderly
#				release.
#
#		tpi_raw		Transport provider interface, raw transport
#				service.
#
# <flag>	Either a "-" or a sequence of letters, "v" or "b" as follows:
#		
#		-   Indicates that no flags are specified.
#
#		v   Indicates that the visible flag is specified.  Visible
#		    network transports are exposed to the getnetpath(3)
#		    subroutine when the {NETPATH} environment variable is not
#		    set.
#
#		b   Indicates that the broadcast flag is specified.  Network
#		    transports with the broadcast flag set permit RPC
#		    broadcast.
#
# <family>	The protocol family.  This can be one of the following:
#
#		-	    No protocol family applies (experimental).
#		loopback    Loopback interface (to local host).
#		inet	    Internet protocol version 4.
#		inet6	    Internet protocol version 6.
#		implink	    ARPANET imp addresses.
#		pup	    PUP protocols.
#		chaos	    MIT CHAOS protocols.
#		ns	    XEROX NS protocols.
#		nbs	    NBS protocols.
#		ecma	    ECMA (European Computer Manufactuers Association)
#			    protocols.
#		datakit	    DATAKIT protocols.
#		ccitt	    CCITT (IUT-T) protocols, X.25, etc.
#		sna	    IBM SNA (Synchronous Network Architecture)
#			    protocols.
#		decnet	    DECNET protocols.
#		dli	    Direct data link interface.
#		lat	    LAT.
#		hylink	    NSC Hyperchannel.
#		appletalk   Apple Talk.
#		nit	    Network Interface Tap.
#		ieee802	    IEEE 802.2, also ISO 8802.
#		osi	    Umbrella for all families used by OSI.
#		x25	    CCITT (ITU-T) X.25.
#		osinet	    AFI = 47, IDI = 4.
#		gosip	    U.S. Government OSI.
#
# <proto>	The protocol name.  This can be one of the following:
#
#		-	No protocol name applies.
#		sctp	Stream Control Transmission Protocol.
#		tcp	Transmission Control Protocol.
#		udp	User Datagram Protocol.
#		icmp	Internet Control Message Protoocol.
#		ipx	Internet Packet Exchange Protocol.
#		spx	Sequenced Packet Exchange Protocol.
#
# <device>	The absolute filesystem path to the appropriate STREAMS
#		device.  For example, /dev/inet/tcp.
#
# <n2alibs>	Comma separated list of full path names to the name to address
#		dynamic libraries providing a directory service for this
#		network transport, or as dash, "-", indicating that there are
#		no name to address directory service libraries.
#
# Any additional information past the <n2alibs> field is ignored.
