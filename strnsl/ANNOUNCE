Package strnsl-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-07.

UNIX has traditionally provided three components of the Network Services
Library, `libnsl', two of which are associated with the X/Open Transport
Interface/Transport Layer Interface (XTI/TLI), `libxnet', the Trasnport
Provider Interface (TPI), and STREAMS network pseudo-device drivers.
Two components provide the TI (Transport Independent) interface, whereas
the other provides the TS (Transport Sockets) interface.  The TI
components provide the Transport Independent RPC services (TI-RPC)
pioneered by Sun Microsystems and subsequently standardized by the IETF.

GNU/Linux `glibc' provides (amoungst other things) the RPC interface
library and the TS-RPC and BSD 4.3 sockets address translation
facilities in `libc', and provides NIS capabilities in `libnsl'.
STREAMS related components that are not currently part of the Linux
Network Services Library (libnsl) are:

  1. Network Selection, consisting of:
        * Network Configuration database access, netconfig(3), and,
        * Network Path access, netpath(3).
  2. Name-to-Address Translation, netdir(3).

These are often referred to as the Network Selection facility of the
Network Services Library.  The OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library
package provides a library, renamed `libxnsl', that provides the missing
Network Selection and Name-to-Address mapping facilities designed to
work with xti(3).

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library package contains header
files and the associated documentation that were originally contained in
the `strxnet' package.  This library was quickly removed from the
`strxnet' distribution and placed in its own add-on package.

The package contains the following standard SVR 4.2 conforming header
files:

     - <netconfig.h> Network Configuration
     - <sys/netconfig.h> Network Configuration
     - <netdir.h> Network Directory

Note that the XTI/TLI Library and Transport Provider Interface header
files are contained in the strxnet-0.9.2.9 package.

The package builds and installs the following shared object libraries:

xnsl(3)
     This is the X/Open Network Services Library that contains the
     Network Selection facility for the Network Services Library.


The OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library package includes SVR 4.2
STREAMS libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development
environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7 STREAMS Network
Services Library applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This is the first separate release from The OpenSS7 Project of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library package.  This package provides
the `libxnsl' library providing the Network Selection Facility for the
Network Services Library.  The package contains all the necessary manual
pages and other documentation.  The package is packaged as an OpenSS7
style autoconf tarball.

This is the initial alpha release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is part of
the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is the initial public release.

_This is a public alpha release of the package: it deprecates previous
releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before reporting bugs.
Please see README-alpha in the release, or `Maturity', in the manual._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strnsl package page (http://www.openss7.org/strnsl_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strnsl-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strnsl-0.9.2.1/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `strnsl.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/strnsl_manual.html).

  - Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library package contains header
files and the associated documentation that were originally contained in
the strxnet package. This library was quickly removed from the strxnet
distribution and placed in its own add-on package.

This is another separate release from The OpenSS7 Project of the OpenSS7
STREAMS Network Services Library package. This package provides the
libxnsl library providing the Network Selection Facility for the Network
Services Library. The package contains all the necessary manual pages
and other documentation. The package is packaged as an OpenSS7 style
autoconf tarball.

This is an alpha release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is part of the
OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.G). The release provides support
for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

  - Minor documentation corrections.
  - Kernel module license made explicit GPL v2. And then changed back
    to GPL.
  - License upgrade to AGPL Version 3.
  - Modifications to build under Fedora 2.6.22.5-49 kernel. These
    changes also support 2.6.22.9-91.fc7 kernel.
  - Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation
    primarily for embedded targets.
  - Improvements to common build process for embedded and
    cross-compile targets.
  - Modifications to build under Fedora 2.6.25-45.fc9 and
    2.6.26.5-45.fc9 kernels.
  - Updated tool chain to m4-1.4.12, autoconf-2.63 and texinfo-4.13.
  - Conversion of RPM spec files to common approach for major
    subpackages.
  - Updated references database for manual pages and roff(1)
    documents.
  - Build system now builds yum(8) repositories for RPMs and
    apt-get(8) repositories for DEBs. Installation documentation has
    been updated to include details of repository install sourcesref.
  - Added MODULE_VERSION to all modules and drivers.
  - Several important bug fixes for thread safety of the socket
    library: see BUGS in the release, or Bugs in the manual, for more
    information.

This is a public alpha release of the package. This package is currently
incomplete. It is being released as a reference point for the community.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the GNU Affero General Public
License (AGPL) Version 3.  The release is available as an autoconf
tarball, SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs. See the downloads
page for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs. See the strnsl package
