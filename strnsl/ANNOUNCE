strnsl-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 on January 8, 2007.

`UNIX' has traditionally provided three components of the Network
Services Library, `libnsl', two of which are associated with the X/Open
Transport Interface/Transport Layer Interface (XTI/TLI), `libxnet', the
Trasnport Provider Interface (TPI), and "STREAMS" network pseudo-device
drivers.  Two components provide the TI (Transport Independent)
interface, whereas the other provides the TS (Transport Sockets)
interface.  The TI components provide the Transport Independent RPC
services (TI-RPC) pioneered by Sun Microsystems and subsequently
standardized by the IETF.

`GNU/Linux' `glibc' provides (amoungst other things) the RPC interface
library and the TS-RPC and BSD 4.3 sockets address translation
facilities in `libc', and provides NIS capabilities in `libnsl'.
"STREAMS" related components that are not currently part of the `Linux'
Network Services Library (`libnsl') are:

  1. Network Selection, consisting of:

        * Network Configuration database access, `netconfig(3)', and,
        * Network Path access, `netpath(3)'.

  2. Name-to-Address Translation, `netdir(3)'.

These are often referred to as the Network Selection facility of the
Network Services Library.  The `OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services
Library' package provides a library, renamed `libxnsl', that provides
the missing Network Selection and Name-to-Address mapping facilities
designed to work with `xti(3)'.

The `OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library' package contains header
files and the associated documentation that were originally contained
in the `strxnet' package.  This library was quickly removed from the
`strxnet' distribution and placed in its own add-on package.  The package
contains all the necessary manual pages and other documentation in an
autoconf tarball.

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strnsl' release.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

  This is the initial public alpha test release of the package.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strnsl package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strnsl_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and
binary RPMs.

<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strnsl-0.9.2.1/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strnsl.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strnsl_manual.html>).
