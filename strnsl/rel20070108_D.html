This is the first separate release from `The OpenSS7 Project' of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS Network
Services Library' package.  This package provides the `libxnsl' library providing the Network
Selection Facility for the Network Services Library.  The package contains all the necessary manual
pages and other documentation.  The package is packaged as an OpenSS7 style autoconf tarball.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is the initial public release.
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Additional features supported in all packages (see master package release notes).</li>
<!--
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new - -with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added - -disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.1 of the STREAMS Network Services Library (NSL) <em>strnsl</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
`UNIX' has traditionally provided three components of the Network Services Library, `libnsl', two of
which are associated with the X/Open Transport Interface/Transport Layer Interface (XTI/TLI),
`libxnet', the Trasnport Provider Interface (TPI), and "STREAMS" network pseudo-device drivers.  Two
components provide the TI (Transport Independent) interface, whereas the other provides the TS
(Transport Sockets) interface.  The TI components provide the Transport Independent RPC services
(TI-RPC) pioneered by Sun Microsystems and subsequently standardized by the IETF.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
`GNU/Linux' `glibc' provides (amoungst other things) the RPC interface library and the TS-RPC and
BSD 4.3 sockets address translation facilities in `libc', and provides NIS capabilities in `libnsl'.
"STREAMS" related components that are not currently part of the `Linux' Network Services Library
(`libnsl') are:
</p><ol style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Network Selection, consisting of:</li>
<ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
    <li>Network Configuration database access, <a href="man/man2html?3+netconfig">netconfig(3)</a>, and,</li>
    <li>Network Path access, <a href="man/man2html?3+netpath">netpath(3)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Name-to-Address Translation, <a href="man/man2html?3+netdir">netdir(3)</a>.</li>
</ol><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
These are often referred to as the Network Selection facility of the Network Services Library.  The
`OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library' package provides a library, renamed `libxnsl', that
provides the missing Network Selection and Name-to-Address mapping facilities designed to work with
<a href="man/man2html?3+xti">xti(3)</a>.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The `OpenSS7 STREAMS Network Services Library' package contains header files and the associated
documentation that were originally contained in the `strxnet' package.  This library was quickly
removed from the `strxnet' distribution and placed in its own add-on package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
