#
# RPM calls this script and provides a list of packaged files on standard input.
# The script checks the files in the build directory to see whether they have
# all been packaged or not.  The script that ships with RPM is not so efficient.
# It uses temporary files where none are needed.
#
# The output is indented 3 spaces to be compatible with previous versions of the
# check-files script contained with rpm.
#
# This file is invoked from rpm by invoking from an rpm spec file (or
# ~/.rpmmacros file) the following:
#
# %__check_files \
# %{_builddir}/%{name}-%{version}/scripts/rpm/check-files %{buildroot}
#
# Setting the following to 1 will cause unpackaged files to terminate the
# build.  When set to 0, warnings are still generated.
#
# %_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 1
#

# Following is a listing of the script that comes with RPM for reference:

## #
## # Gets file list on standard input and RPM_BUILD_ROOT as first parameter
## # and searches for omitted files and symlinks (not counting directories).
## # Returns it's output on standard output.

## # filon@pld.org.pl
