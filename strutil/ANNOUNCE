strutil-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 on August 23, 2006.

STREAMS Utilities is an implementation of STREAMS Utilities for Linux
Fast-STREAMS and provides compatibility for Linux with all major UNIX
implementations of STREAMS.

This is the OpenSS7 Project's first separate release from the OpenSS7
Project of the OpenSS7 STREAMS Utilities.  This strutil package provides
compatibility with:

* AIX
* etc.

This release is the initial public release.

This is public alpha release of the package: it deprecates previous
releases.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
releases.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strutil package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strutil_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strutil-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strutil-0.9.2.1/NEWS> in the release

Package strutil-0.9.2.3 was released under GPLv2 on 2007-03-15.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Utilities package provides STREAMS modules and
drivers, programs and daemons for administration and handling of the
STREAMS subsystem.

The strutil package is currently incomplete.  The purpose of the package
was to move STREAMS utility programs and modules outside of the STREAMS
release package so as to allow them to be used with both LiS and Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  As Linux Fast-STREAMS has already shown superior to LiS
in terms of both performance and conformance, it is no longer necessary
to keep these packages separate and they can be combined once again with
Linux Fast-STREAMS.

This is an internal alpha release of the package.

Major features since the last internal release are as follows:

 - Added versions to all exported symbols.  Made OpenSS7 unique
   functions GPL export.

 - Improvements to the common build environment with better support for
   standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

 - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

 - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kernels.

 - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as
   unpacked by separate tarball.

This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strutil package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strutil_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strutil-0.9.2.2/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strutil-0.9.2.2/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strutil.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strutil_manual.html>).
