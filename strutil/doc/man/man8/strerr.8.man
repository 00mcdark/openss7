.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B strerr
daemon receives error log messages from the
.I STREAMS
log driver and appends them to a log file.  The error log files produced
reside in the directory
.BR /var/adm/streams " or " /var/log/streams ,
or a user-specified directory,
and are named
.BI error. mm-dd\fR,
where
.I mm
is the month and
.I dd
is the day of the messages contained in each log file.
.PP
Messages that appear in the error log are intended to report exceptional
conditions that require the attention of the person who administers your
system.  Those messages indicating the total failure of a
.I STREAMS
driver or module should have the
.B F
flag set.  Those messages requiring the immediate attention of the
administrator should have the
.B N
flag set, which causes the error logger to send the message to that person by
way of the
.BR mail (1)
command.  The priority level usually has no meaning in the error log, but does
have meaning if the message is also sent to the tracer process.
.PP
Once initiated, the
.B strerr
daemon continues to execute until terminated by the user.  Usually, the
.B strerr
daemon is executed asynchronously.
.\"

.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The format of an error log message is:
.RB < seq "> <" time "> <" ticks "> <" flags "> <" mid "> <" sud "> <" text >
These fields are defined as follows:
.TP
.RB < seq >
Error sequence number.
.TP
.RB < time >
Time of the message in hh:mm:ss.
.TP
.RB < ticks >
Time of the message in machine ticks since boot priority level.
.TP
.RB < flags >
One of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B T
The message was also sent to a tracing process.
.TP
.B F
Indicates a fatal error.
.TP
.B N
Send mail to the person who administers your system.
.RE
.TP
.RB < mid >
Module ID number of source.
.TP
.RB < sud >
Sub-ID number of source.
.TP
.RB < text >
Formatted text of the error message.
On multiprocessor systems,
.RB < text >
is composed of two parts:
.RS
.IP \(bu
the number of processors where the owner of the message has sent it.
.IP \(bu
the formatted text itself.
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1)
indicates that an error occurred and a diagnostic message is printed on
.BR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message
is printed on
.BR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
option suppresses the printing of diagnostic messages to
.BR stderr .
.\"
.\"
.SH SIGNALS
.PP
.B strerr
catches the
.B SIGHUP
signal
.RB "(see " signal (7)).
.TP
.B SIGHUP
When the
.B SIGHUP
signal is caught,
.B strerr
will close the current log file and open a new (or reopen the existing) log
file.  This is for use with
.BR logrotate (8).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Only one
.BR strerr
daemon at a time is permitted to open the
.I STREAMS
log driver.  If a module or driver is generating a large number of error
messages, running the error logger causes a degradation in
.I STREAMS
performance.  If a large number of messages are generated in a short time, the
log driver any not be able to deliver some of the messages.  This situation is
indicated by gaps in the sequence numbering of the messages in the log files.

is compatible with

and systems based on
.B "SVR 4.2"
such as
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,

with the following portability considerations:

Options
.BR -n ", " -b ", " -o ", " -e ", " -p " and " -l
and all long options, are specific to this

implementation of
.B strerr
and should not be used by portable applications.
.IP \(em
No other implementation documents the
.BR -q ", " -D ", " -v ", " -h ", " -V " or " -C
options.
They should not be used by portable applications.
.IP \(em
Options
.BR --help " and " --version
are provided for compatibility with GNU coding standards;
.BR --copying ,
OpenSS7 coding standards.
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
do not document the
.BR -a " or " -d
options;
.IR HP-UX \(rg
and
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
do.
.IP \(em
All other implementations document the log file directory as
.B /var/adm/streams
instead of
.BR /var/log/streams .
.B /var/log/streams
is used under
.B Linux
for compatibility with the
.BR "Linux File Standard" .
For compatibility,
.B strerr
first checks if the directory
.B /var/adm/streams
exists, and then creates
.B /var/log/streams
if necessary, unless a directory is specified with the
.B -d
option.
.IP \(em
Under
.IR "SVR 4.2"
.[
svr42cr
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7doc
.]
the
.I STREAMS
error logger is called
.B /dev/log
rather than
.BR /dev/strlog .
Under
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
.[
osfdoc
.]
the
.I STREAMS
error logger is called
.B /dev/stream/log
instead of
.BR /dev/strlog .
For compatibility with these operating environments,
.B strerr
attempts to open
.BR /dev/streams/log ", " /dev/strlog " and then " /dev/log
if not specified with the
.B -l
option.
The call to
.B strerr
will fail if there is no
.IR STREAMS -based
log device in this search sequence, or specified with the
.B -l
option.
