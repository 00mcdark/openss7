.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.HP 12
\fBstrreset\fR [ \fB-M\fI major \fR] [ \fB-m\fI minor \fR]
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B strreset
command reset an open stream by generating a
.BR M_FLUSH (9)
message to the stream head.  You use it mainly to reset blocked streams.  When
it is impossible to reopen the stream, issue an
.B I_FLUSH
.BR streamio (7)
.BR ioctl (20,
or equivalen command.  This situation may happen with a process sleeping in a
module's close routine, when signals can not be sent to the process (a zombie
process exiting, for example).
