.HP 8
.BI "int ioctl(" pfds[0] ", " I_PUSH ", " \*(lqpipemod\*(rq );

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B pipemod
is a
.I STREAMS
module that is pushed over one end of a
.IR STREAMS -based
bidirectional pipe, or pushed over a FIFO,
to reverse the send of the
.B M_FLUSH
command.  (See the
.I I_FLUSH
command to
.BR streamio (7)).
.PP
Pipes and FIFOs have a twist in the stream at their midpoints.  At their
midpoints, the read-side stream becomes the write-side stream and visa versa.
As an
.B M_FLUSH
message traverses the twist, the sense of read-side and write-side must be
reversed within the message (as indicated by the
.BR FLUSHW
and
.BR FLUSHR
flags).
.B pipemod
accomplishes this swapping of the read and write side flush flags across the
twist at the midpoint in a
.I STREAMS -based
pipe or FIFO.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.B pipemod
should be pushed over one end of a newly created
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe, or pushed over a FIFO, before any other modules are pushed on either end
of the pipe, or onto the FIFO.  This ensures that
.B pipemod
sits at the midpoint of the pipe or FIFO, the necessary position for reversing the
send of the
.B M_FLUSH
message.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
It is not necessary to use
.B pipemod
if all flushes flush both read and write queues at the same time,
or if the
.I I_FLUSH
command is never issued on the pipe for one side of the stream,
or the
.B M_FLUSH
command is never send by a pushed module for one side of the stream.
.PP
Note that the stream head normally flushes the stream on final close of the
stream.  This flush is performed on both the read and write side of the stream
at the same time, so the stream head does not require
.BR pipemod .
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Following is an example of the
.B s_pipe
function which generates a
.IR STREAMS -based
software pipe and pushes the
.B pipemod
module on one end:
.nf
\fC\s-2
int s_pipe(int fds[2])
{
        int err;
        if ((err = pipe(fds)) != 0)
                return (err);
        if ((err = ioctl(fds[0], I_PUSH, "pipemod")) < 0) {
                close(fds[0]);
                close(fds[1]);
                return (err);
        }
        return (0);
}
