This is the OpenSS7 Release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, drivers and modules
used with the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} or @cite{Linux STREAMS} SVR 4.2 STREAMS utility for Linux.

The purpose of providing a separate release of this package was to separate the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, headers, drivers and modules from the @cite{Linux STREAMS} package for
use with both @cite{Linux STREAMS} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} in preparation for replacement of
the former by the later.

The following sections provide information on @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} releases as well as
compatibility information of OpenSS7 release to mainstream UNIX releases of the core, modules and
drivers, as well as Linux kernel compatibility.

@node Prerequisites
@section Prerequisites
@cindex prerequisites

Prerequisites for the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package are as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item A fairly LSB compliant GNU/Linux distribution.
@footnote{@xref{GNU/Linux Distributions}, for more information.}
@item Linux 2.4 or 2.6 kernel (2.4.10 - 2.4.27) or (2.6.3 - 2.6.10)
@item glibc2 or better.
@item GNU info (for info files).
@item GNU groff (for man pages).
@footnote{If you are using a Debian release, please make sure to install the groff extension package
(@samp{groff_ext}), as it contains the @command{refer} or @command{grefer} commands necessary for
including references in the manual pages.}

@node GNU/Linux Distributions
@subsection GNU/Linux Distributions
@cindex GNU/Linux Distributions

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} is compatible with the following @dfn{Linux} distributions:

@itemize @bullet
@item RedHat Linux 7.2 (RH7)
@item RedHat Linux 7.3 (RH7)
@item Performance Technlogies @dfn{NexusWare24}
@item RedHat Linux 8.0 (RH8)
@item RedHat Linux 9 (RH9)
@item SuSE 8.0 Professional

@item Mandrakelinux 9.2 (MDK92)
@item RedHat Enterprise Linux 3.0 (EL3)
@item WhiteBox Enterprise Linux 3.0 (WBEL3)
@item CentOS Enterprise Linux 3.4 (centos34)
@item Fedora Core 2 (FC2)
@item SuSE 9.1 Personal
@item Mandrakelinux 10.0 (MDK100)

@item Fedora Core 3 (FC3)
@item RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 (EL4)
@item CentOS Enterprise Linux 4.0 (centos4)
@item WhiteBox Enterprise Linux 4 (WBEL4)

@end itemize

When installing from the tarball (@pxref{Installing the Tar Ball}), this distribution is probably
compatible with a  much broader array of distributions than those listed above.  These are the
distributions against which the current maintainer creates and tests builds.

@node Linux Kernel
@subsection Kernel
@cindex Kernel

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package compiles as a @dfn{Linux} kernel module.  It is not
necessary to patch the @dfn{Linux} kernel to build or use the package.@footnote{At a later date, it
is possible to move this package into the kernel, however, with continued resistance to STREAMS from
within the @dfn{Linux} developer community, this is currently unlikely.} Nor do you have to
recompile your kernel to build or use the package.  OpenSS7 packages use @command{autoconf} scripts
to adapt the package source to your existing kernel.  The package builds and runs nicely against
production kernels from the distributions listed above.  Rather than relying on kernel versions, the
@command{autoconf} scripts interrogate the kernel for specific features and variants to better adapt
to distribution production kernels that have had patches applied over the official
@url{http://www.kernel.org/, kernel.org} sources.

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is compatible with 2.4 kernel series after 2.4.10.  It has
been tested up to and including 2.6.11.

@node Linux STREAMS
@subsection Linux STREAMS
@cindex Linux STREAMS

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is currently compatible with @cite{Linux STREAMS (LiS)},
however, to use the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package with @cite{LiS} requires use of the OpenSS7
release packages of @cite{LiS}.
The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is compatible with the OpenSS7 @b{LiS-2.18.2} release that
is available from the @url{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, The OpenSS7 Project Downloads
Page}.

@node Linux Fast-STREAMS
@subsection Linux Fast-STREAMS
@cindex Linux Fast-STREAMS

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is currently compatible with @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS
(LfS)}.
The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is compatible with the OpenSS7 @b{streams-0.7a.4} release
that is available from the @url{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, The OpenSS7 Project Downloads
Page}.

@node Bugs
@section Bugs
@cindex bugs

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} has many known bugs.  These are alpha releases.  Use at your own risk.
Remember that there is @b{NO WARRANTY}.@footnote{See section @b{NO WARRANY} under @ref{GNU General
Public License}.}

@b{This software is @i{alpha} software.  As such, it will likely crash your kernel.  Installation
of the software may irreparably mangle your header files or Linux distribution in such a way as to
make it unusable.  Crashes will likely lock your system and rebooting the system might not repair the
problem.  You can loose all the data on your system.  Because this software can crash your kernel,
the resulting unstable system could destroy computer hardware or peripherals making them unusable.
You will likely void the warranty on any system on which you run this software. YOU HAVE BEEN
WARNED.}
