@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3

Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on x86_64
architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler
warnings.

Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on mailing
list.

This is an internal alpha release.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2

The previous release was experimental and was an Alpha release.  This package
represent a stripping off of utilities from @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} that
could also be used for @cite{Linux STREAMS (LiS)}.  This release is the result
of further development and testing on this utilities package.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the @command{@value{PACKAGE}} release.

This is the initial release of the @cite{OpenSS7 STREAMS Utilities} package
for @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} (and LiS).  These STREAMS utilities were
formerly part of the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} package
(@file{streams-0.7a.3}), however, as they were also applicable to LiS, they
have been removed into a separate package.  Once @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} is
production grade, these compatibility modules will be rolled back into the
streams package as @cite{LiS} becomes deprecated.
