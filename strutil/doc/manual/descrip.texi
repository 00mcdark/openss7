The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package provides @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers, programs and
daemons for administration and handling of the @dfn{STREAMS} subsystem.

@quotation
The @command{@value{PACKAGE}} package is currently incomplete.  The purpose of the package was to
move @dfn{STREAMS} utility programs and modules outside of the @dfn{STREAMS} release package so as
to allow them to be used with both @cite{LiS} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.  As @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS} has already shown superior to @cite{LiS} in terms of both performance and conformance,
it is no longer necessary to keep these packages separate and they can be combined once again with
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.
@end quotation

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package includes kernel modules, @cite{SVR 4.2} @dfn{STREAMS}
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the
development and execution of @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers.  This package contains primarily
user-space utilities and test programs.

This distribution is only currently applicable to @cite{Linux} 2.4 and 2.6 kernels and was targeted
at @code{ix86}, @code{x86_64}, @code{ppc} and @code{ppc64} architectures, but should build and
install for other architectures as well.
