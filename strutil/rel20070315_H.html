OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.5 of the STREAMS Utilities <em>strutil</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The <cite>OpenSS7 STREAMS Utilities</cite> package provides STREAMS modules and drivers, programs
and daemons for administration and handling of the STREAMS subsystem.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The strutil package is currently incomplete.  The purpose of the package was to move STREAMS utility
programs and modules outside of the STREAMS release package so as to allow them to be used with both
LiS and Linux Fast-STREAMS.  As Linux Fast-STREAMS has already shown superior to LiS in terms of
both performance and conformance, it is no longer necessary to keep these packages separate and they
can be combined once again with Linux Fast-STREAMS.

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
