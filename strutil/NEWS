The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Utilities package.

 Major changes for release strutil-0.9.2.4
------------------------------------------

This is an internal alpha release of the package.

 Major changes for release strutil-0.9.2.3.rc3
----------------------------------------------

   * Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   * Added versioning of all library symbols.

   * Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   * Dropped support for `LiS'.

   * Updated `init' scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   * Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.
     `strutil' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: `LiS' cannot support this change.

   * Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   * Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   * Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   * Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   * Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

This was an internal alpha release.

 Major changes for release strutil-0.9.2.3.rc2
----------------------------------------------

Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
compiler warnings.

Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
mailing list.

This was an internal alpha release.

 Major changes for release strutil-0.9.2.2
------------------------------------------

The previous release was experimental and was an Alpha release.  This
package represent a stripping off of utilities from `Linux
Fast-STREAMS' that could also be used for `Linux STREAMS (LiS)'.  This
release is the result of further development and testing on this
utilities package.

 Initial release strutil-0.9.2.1
--------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strutil' release.

This is the initial release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS Utilities' package
for `Linux Fast-STREAMS' (and LiS).  These STREAMS utilities were
formerly part of the `Linux Fast-STREAMS' package (`streams-0.7a.3'),
however, as they were also applicable to LiS, they have been removed
into a separate package.  Once `Linux Fast-STREAMS' is production
grade, these compatibility modules will be rolled back into the streams
package as `LiS' becomes deprecated.
