This is the third open source release of the <cite>OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN</cite> package.  This
release contains modules and drivers formerly only available with Commercial releases of the
<tt>strss7</tt> package and which are only recently available as open source with the release of
this package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
With OpenSS7 Master Package release openss7-0.9.2.D, the SIGTRAN and SS7 over IP components were
separated from the <tt>strss7</tt> package and placed in this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN
components previously part of the <tt>strss7</tt> package have been strapped into this release.
Components will be re-validated against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See <a href="codefiles/sigtran-0.9.2.3/TODO">TODO</a> in the release, or
<em>Schedule,</em> in the manual, for information about the release schedule.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The major component first available is M2PA.  <a href="man2html?m2pa_sl(4)"><b>m2pa_sl</b>(4)</a> is
a pushable STREAMS module that is pushed over a <a href="man2html?sctp_n(4)"><b>sctp_n</b>(4)</a>
SCTP driver Stream to form an M2PA signalling link providing the Signalling Link service interface
(<a href="man2html?sli(7)"><b>sli</b>(7)</a>).  A complete test suite that tests to
draft-bidulock-sigtran-m2pa-07.txt is included in the release.  The historical SS7 over IP
implementations are provided, but without conformance test suites.  The release also contains
simplified AS modules for M2UA (<a href="man2html?m2ua_as(4)"><b>m2ua_as</b>(4)</a>), M3UA
(<a href="man2html?m3ua_as(4)"><b>m3ua_as</b>(4)</a>) that as yet do not have a conformance test
suite.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Subsequent releases in 3Q 2007 will include the additional full M3UA, SUA and TUA multiplexing
drivers with conformance test suites.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Major features since the last public release are as follows:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Dramatic performance improvements enabled by Linux Fast-STREAMS and STREAMS SCTP.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support build on openSUSE 10.2.<bdo/></li>
