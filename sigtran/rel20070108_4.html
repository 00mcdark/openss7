This is the initial open source release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN package.  This release
contains modules and drivers formerly only available with Commercial releases of the `strss7'
package and which are only recently available as open source with the release of this package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
With OpenSS7 Master Package release openss7-0.9.2.D, the SIGTRAN and SS7 over IP components were
separated from the `strss7' package and placed in this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN components
previously part of the `strss7' package have been strapped into this release.  Components will be
re-validated against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module and driver-by-driver basis.  See
TODO in the release, or `Schedule', in the manual, for information about the release schedule.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
In this initial release, the major component first available is M2PA.  m2pa_sl(4) is a pushable
STREAMS module that is pushed over a sctp_n(4) SCTP driver Stream to form an M2PA signalling
link providing the Signalling Link service interface (sli(7)).  A complete test suite that tests
to draft-bidulock-sigtran-m2pa-07.txt is included in the release.  The historical SS7 over IP
implementations are provided, but without conformance test suites.  The release also contains
simplified AS modules for M2UA (m2ua_as(4)), M3UA (m3ua_as(4)) that as yet do not have a
conformance test suite.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full M3UA, SUA and TUA multiplexing
drivers with conformance test suites.  The objective is to have these components publicly available
before the SIGTRAN Interoperability test event in April 2007.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Additional features supported in all packages (see master package release notes).</li>
<!--
<li>Better support for Ubuntu and recent gcc compilers, including debian script corrections.</li>
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries, as well, and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules
and drivers.  The <em>make installcheck</em> target will now automatically test both 64-bit native
and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Added versioning of all library symbols.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for <i>LiS</i>.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  <b>streams</b> now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: <i>LiS</i> cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes
SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new - -with-optimize option to `configure' to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added - -disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>
<li>Each package will now build <a href="man/man2html?1+doxygen">doxygen(1)</a> html documentation
with the doxy make target.  See <em>make help</em> or README-make in the distribution for more
information.</li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.1 of the OpenSS7 SIGTRAN Stack <em>sigtran</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules,
libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the development and
execution of OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This package contains modules and drivers formerly only part of the Commercial releases of the
`strss7' package.  These are commercial grade implementations that have only recently been released
as open source.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
