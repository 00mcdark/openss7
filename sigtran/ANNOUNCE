Package sigtran-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS SIGTRAN applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This package contains modules and drivers formerly only part of the
Commercial releases of the `strss7' package.  These are commercial grade
implementations that have only recently been released as open source.

This is the initial open source release of the OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which are
only recently available as open source with the release of this package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release openss7-0.9.2.D, the SIGTRAN and SS7
over IP components were separated from the `strss7' package and placed
in this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN components previously part of
the `strss7' package have been strapped into this release.  Components
will be re-validated against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module
and driver-by-driver basis.  See TODO in the release, or `Schedule', in
the manual, for information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is M2PA.
m2pa_sl(4) is a pushable STREAMS module that is pushed over a sctp_n(4)
SCTP driver Stream to form an M2PA signalling link providing the
Signalling Link service interface (sli(7)).  A complete test suite that
tests to draft-bidulock-sigtran-m2pa-07.txt is included in the release.
The historical SS7 over IP implementations are provided, but without
conformance test suites.  The release also contains simplified AS
modules for M2UA (m2ua_as(4)), M3UA (m3ua_as(4)) that as yet do not have
a conformance test suite.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full M3UA,
SUA and TUA multiplexing drivers with conformance test suites.  The
objective is to have these components publicly available before the
SIGTRAN Interoperability test event in April 2007.

This is a stable, production grade release of M2PA for Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  It deprecates previous SIGTRAN component releases from
the `strss7' package.  Please upgrade to the most current release of
these components before reporting bugs.

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
sigtran package page (http://www.openss7.org/sigtran_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sigtran-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sigtran-0.9.2.1/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `sigtran.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/sigtran_manual.html).
