The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN package.

 Major changes for release sigtran-0.9.2.2
------------------------------------------

This is the second open source release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the SIGTRAN and
SS7 over IP components were separated from the `strss7' package and
placed in this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN components previously
part of the `strss7' package have been strapped into this release.
Components will be re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a
module-by-module and driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the
release, or `Schedule', in the manual, for information about the
release schedule.

This is a stable, production grade release of M2PA for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  It deprecates previous SIGTRAN component releases from
the `strss7' package.  Please upgrade to the most current release of
these components before reporting bugs.  This release is a maintenance
release and provides support for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Support for autoconf 2.61 and gettext 0.16.

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kenels.

   - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number
     as unpacked by separate tarball.


 Major changes for release sigtran-0.9.2.1
------------------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `sigtran' release.

This is the initial open source release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the SIGTRAN and
SS7 over IP components were separated from the `strss7' package and
placed in this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN components previously
part of the `strss7' package have been strapped into this release.
Components will be re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a
module-by-module and driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the
release, or `Schedule', in the manual, for information about the
release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is M2PA.  `m2pa_sl(4)'
is a pushable "STREAMS" module that is pushed over a `sctp_n(4)' SCTP
driver Stream to form an M2PA signalling link providing the Signalling
Link service interface (`sli(7)').  A complete test suite that tests to
`draft-bidulock-sigtran-m2pa-07.txt' is included in the release.  The
historical SS7 over IP implementations are provided, but without
conformance test suites.  The release also contains simplified AS
modules for M2UA (`m2ua_as(4)'), M3UA (`m3ua_as(4)') that as yet do not
have a conformance test suite.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full M3UA,
SUA and TUA multiplexing drivers with conformance test suites.  The
objective is to have these components publicly available before the
SIGTRAN Interoperability test event in April 2007.

This is a stable, production grade release of M2PA for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  It deprecates previous SIGTRAN component releases from
the `strss7' package.  Please upgrade to the most current release of
these components before reporting bugs.

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball, SRPM,
DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs,
see the sigtran package page (http://www.openss7.org/sigtran_pkg.html).
