The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN package.

 Major changes for release sigtran-0.9.2.4
------------------------------------------

This is the fourth open source release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the SIGTRAN and
SS7 over IP components were separated from the `strss7' package and
placed in this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN components previously
part of the `strss7' package have been strapped into this release.
Components will be re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a
module-by-module and driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the
release, or `Schedule',in the manual, for information about the release
schedule.

This is a stable, production grade release of M2PA.  It deprecates
previous SIGTRAN component releases from the `strss7' package.  Please
upgrade to the most current release of these components before
reporting bugs.  This release is a maintenance release and provides
support for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Added SG (Signalling Gateway) project document.

   - Minor documentation corrections.

   - Kernel module license made explicit "GPL v2".  And then changed
     back to "GPL".

   - License upgrade to AGPL Version 3.

   - Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation
     primarily for embedded targets.

   - Improvements to common build process for embedded and
     cross-compile targets.

   - Support for flex 2.5.33  in maintainer mode.


_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU Affero General Public
License Version 3'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball,
SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs,
see the sigtran package page (http://www.openss7.org/sigtran_pkg.html).

See `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sigtran-0.9.2.4/ChangeLog' and
`http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sigtran-0.9.2.4/NEWS' in the release
for more information.  Also, see the `sigtran.pdf' manual in the
release (also in html `http://www.openss7.org/sigtran_manual.html').

 Major changes for release sigtran-0.9.2.2
------------------------------------------

This is the second open source release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

This is a stable, production grade release of M2PA for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  It deprecates previous SIGTRAN component releases from
the `strss7' package.  Please upgrade to the most current release of
these components before reporting bugs.  This release is a maintenance
release and provides support for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - A number of SIGTRAN AS drivers (M2UA, M3UA, SUA, TUA) are present
     in the release (that have not been fully tested and do not have
     testsuites just yet).  Consider these as alpha until the next
     release.

   - Corrections for several non-testsuite affecting bugs discovered in
     the M2PA module. (See
     `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sigtran-0.9.2.4/BUGS' in the
     release for more information.)

   - Improvements to the common build environment with better support
     for standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

   - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386
     kernels.

   - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number
     as unpacked by separate tarball.


 Major changes for release sigtran-0.9.2.1
------------------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `sigtran' release.

This is the initial open source release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN'
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only
available with Commercial releases of the `strss7' package and which
are only recently available as open source with the release of this
package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release `openss7-0.9.2.D', the SIGTRAN and
SS7 over IP components were separated from the `strss7' package and
placed in this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN components previously
part of the `strss7' package have been strapped into this release.
Components will be re-validated against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' on a
module-by-module and driver-by-driver basis.  See `TODO' in the
release, or `Schedule',in the manual, for information about the release
schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is M2PA.
`m2pa_sl(4)' is a pushable "STREAMS" module that is pushed over a
`sctp_n(4)' SCTP driver Stream to form an M2PA signalling link
providing the Signalling Link service interface (`sli(7)').  A complete
test suite that tests to `draft-bidulock-sigtran-m2pa-07.txt' is
included in the release.  The historical SS7 over IP implementations are
provided, but without conformance test suites.  The release also
contains simplified AS modules for M2UA (`m2ua_as(4)'), M3UA
(`m3ua_as(4)') that as yet do not have a conformance test suite.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full M3UA,
SUA and TUA multiplexing drivers with conformance test suites.  The
objective is to have these components publicly available before the
SIGTRAN Interoperability test event in April 2007.

This is a stable, production grade release of M2PA for `Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.  It deprecates previous SIGTRAN component releases from
the `strss7' package.  Please upgrade to the most current release of
these components before reporting bugs.
