This is the second open source release of the <cite>OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN</cite> package.  This
release contains modules and drivers formerly only available with Commercial releases of the
<tt>strss7</tt> package and which are only recently available as open source with the release of
this package.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
With OpenSS7 Master Package release openss7-0.9.2.D, the SIGTRAN and SS7 over IP components were
separated from the <tt>strss7</tt> package and placed in this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN
components previously part of the <tt>strss7</tt> package have been strapped into this release.
Components will be re-validated against Linux Fast-STREAMS on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See TODO in the release, or <em>Schedule,</em> in the manual, for
information about the release schedule.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The major component first available is M2PA.  m2pa_sl(4) is a pushable STREAMS module that is pushed
over a sctp_n(4) SCTP driver Stream to form an M2PA signalling link providing the Signalling Link
service interface (sli(7)).  A complete test suite that tests to draft-bidulock-sigtran-m2pa-07.txt
is included in the release.  The historical SS7 over IP implementations are provided, but without
conformance test suites.  The release also contains simplified AS modules for M2UA (m2ua_as(4)),
M3UA (m3ua_as(4)) that as yet do not have a conformance test suite.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full M3UA, SUA and TUA multiplexing
drivers with conformance test suites.  The objective is to have these components publicly available
before the SIGTRAN Interoperability test event in April 2007.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
Major features since the last public release are as follows:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>A number of SIGTRAN AS drivers (M2UA, M3UA, SUA, TUA) are present in the release (that have not been
fully tested and do not have testsuites just yet).  Consider these as alpha until the next
release.<bdo/></li>
<li>Corrections for several non-testsuite affecting bugs discovered in the M2PA module. (See
<a href="codefiles/sigtran-0.9.2.2/BUGS">BUGS</a> in the release for more
information.)<bdo/></li>
<li>Improvements to the common build environment with better support for standalone package builds
on 2.4 kernels.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386 kernels.<bdo/></li>
<li>The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number as unpacked by separate
tarball.<bdo/></li>
</ul><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<em>This is a stable, production grade release of M2PA for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  It deprecates
    previous SIGTRAN component releases from the <tt>strss7</tt> package.  Please upgrade to the
    most current release of these components before reporting bugs.</em>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.2 of the OpenSS7 SIGTRAN Stack <em>sigtran</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules,
libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and development environment for the development and
execution of OpenSS7 STREAMS SIGTRAN applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This package contains modules and drivers formerly only part of the Commercial releases of the
<tt>strss7</tt> package.  These are commercial grade implementations that have only recently been
released as open source.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
