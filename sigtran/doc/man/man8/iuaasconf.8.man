.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B iuasconf
is a configuration utility for the IUA-AS multiplexing driver,
.BR iua-as (4).
Its purpose is to open SCTP Streams, link them under the IUA-AS driver, and configure them using
IUA-AS driver input-output controls.
.PP
The
.B iuasconf
utility is intended to be run at system startup from a System V initialization script, or when
reconfiguration of the IUA-AS driver is necessary.  Once configuration of the IUA-AS multiplexing
driver is complete, application programs (DL-Users) can open, attach, enable and use Signalling Link
streams opened on the driver.

.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.SS "Command Options"
.PP
.TP
[{\fB-c\fR|\fB--command\fR}] \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIARGUMENT\fR [\fI...\fR]]
This option processes the command,
.IR COMMAND .
The literal
.BR -c " or " --command
option can be ommitted and just the arguments listed.  (The
.BR -c " or " --command
option is implied.
.I COMMAND
can be one of the following:
.RS
.TP
.B add
Add the specified entry.
.TP
.B cha
Change the specified entry.
.TP
.B del
Delete the specified entry.
.RE
.TP
{\fB-f\fR|\fB--file\fR} [\fIFILENAME\fR]
.PP
The following command options are common to all OpenSS7 project command line utilities:
.TP
{\fB-h\fR|\fB--help\fR|\fB-H\fR|\fB-?\fR|\fB--?\fR}
When this option is encountered, print usage information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
{\fB-V\fR|\fB--version\fR}
When this option is encountered, print version information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
{\fB-C\fR|\fB--copying\fR}
When this option is encountered, print copying information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.SS "Configuration Options"
.PP
.TP
{\fB-e\fR|\fB--device\fR} \fIDEVNAME\fR
Specifies the IUA-AS device name to be opened for linking and configuring IUA ASP-SG relations.  The
default device name is
.BR /dev/iua-as .
.TP
{\fB-s\fR|\fB--sctpdev\fR} \fIDEVNAME\fR
Specifies the SCTP device name to be opened for establishing SCTP association streams.  The default
device name is
.BR /dev/sctp_t .
.\"
.\"
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
When the
{\fB-f\fP|\fB--file\fP}\ \fIFILENAME\fP
option is specified, the supplied file contains IUA-AS configuration entries as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Each line in the file contains one entry or comment per line.
.IP \(bu
Each entry consists of a number of fields separated by whitespace.
.IP \(bu
Any field that begins with an octothorpe character,
.RB ` # ',
is a comment that continues to the end of the line.
.IP \(bu
Any line containing only a comment (beginning with optional whitespace followed by an octothorpe
character,
.RB ` # ')
is ignored.
.IP \(bu
Blank lines are ignored.
.PP
Each line containing an IUA-AS configuration entry consists of the following fields:
.PP
.RI < sgid >
.RI < aspid >
.RI < options >
.RI < local-endpoint >
.RI < remote-endpoint >
.PP
Where,
.TP
.I sgid
is an SG identifier that is an integer number identifying an ASP-SG relation (i.e. SCTP
association).
.TP
.I aspid
is an ASP Identifier that will be used in the ASP Up request to the SG.  If this field is specified
as zero
.RB ( 0 ),
or as a single dash,
.RB ( - ),
then no ASP Identifier will be used in the ASP Up request to the SG.
.TP
.I options
is a list of comma-separated SG options, with no embedded whitespace.  The following options are
defined:
.RS
.TP
.B dynamic
When included in the options, this keyword specifies that the SG requires dynamic configuration
(registration).  If this option is not included, the SG requires static configuration (no
registration).
.RE
.TP
.I local-endpoint
is the local endpoint address to which the SCTP association is bound to communicate with the remote
SG.  This can take the form:
{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}[\fB,\fR{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}][\fB:\fR{\fIport\fR|\fIservice\fR}].
The special hostname consisting of a single star,
.RB ( * ),
can be used to indicate a wildcard address.  When the wildcard address is used, only one
.IR hostname " or " ipaddress
can occur in the address.  If the
.IR port " or " service
is not specified, then a dynamic port number will be allocated.  If the
.I service
is specified as
.RB \(lq iua ,\(rq
then the IUA registered (well-known) port number will be used.
.TP
.I remote-endpoint
is the remote endpoint address to which the SCTP association is connected to communicate with the
remote SG.  This can take the form:
{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}[\fB,\fR{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}][\fB:\fR{\fIport\fR|\fIservice\fR}].
If the
.IR port " or " service
is not specified, the IUA registered (well-known) port number will be used.
.PP
The
.B iuaasconf
utility, reads this configuration file and performs the following steps for each entry in the file:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The
.B iuaasconf
utility opens an SCTP association by opening the
.B /dev/sctp_t
device, or the device specified with the
.B -s
option.
.IP 2.
The
.B iuaasconf
utility opens a stream on the IUA-AS driver using the
.B /dev/iua-as
device, or the device specified by the
.B -e
option, and links the SCTP stream under the IUA-AS multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
input-output control.
The
.B iuaasconf
utility can then close the file descriptor for the SCTP stream.
.IP 3.
The
.B iuaasconf
utility uses the
.B IUA_AS_IOCSCONFIG
input-output control to associated the lower multiplex SCTP stream with an ASP-SG relation.  The
input-output control takes the information provided in the configuration file line entry, and the
multiplexer identifier returned from the
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
input-output control operation.  The IUA-AS driver, in response to the
.B IUA_AS_IOCSCONFIG
input-output control, completes the ASP-SG relation information as part of the lower multiplex stream
private structure.  The IUA-AS driver also binds and connects the SCTP association and attempts to
bring the ASP to the ASP Up state with the remote SG.
.IP 4.
Steps 1 through 3, above, are repeated for each entry in the configuration file.
.IP 5.
The utility can also open and attach signalling links streams and link them under the DL-MUX
multiplexing driver with a global PPA and CLEI.

.SH SIGNALS
.PP
.TP
.RI { SIGHUP }
This signal causes the
.B iuaasconf
utility to reread the configuration file.
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1) indicates that an
error occurred and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message is printed on
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
options suppresses the printing of diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .
