.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B m2uasconf
is a configuration utility for the M2UA-AS multiplexing driver,
.BR m2ua-as (4).
Its purpose is to open SCTP Streams, link them under the M2UA-AS driver, and configure them using
M2UA-AS driver input-output controls.
.PP
The
.B m2uasconf
utility is intended to be run at system startup from a System V init script, or when reconfiguration
of the M2UA-AS driver is necessary.  Once configuration of the M2UA-AS multiplexing driver is
complete, application programs (SL-Users) can open, attach, enable and use Signalling Link streams
opened on the driver.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.SS "Command Options"
.PP
.PP
The following command options are common to all OpenSS7 project command line utilities:
.TP
{\fB-h\fR|\fB--help\fR|\fB-H\fR|\fB-?\fR|\fB--?\fR}
When this option is encountered, print usage information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
{\fB-V\fR|\fB--version\fR}
When this option is encountered, print version information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.TP
{\fB-C\fR|\fB--copying\fR}
When this option is encountered, print copying information to
.I stdout
and exit.
.\"
.\"
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
When the
{\fB-f\fP|\fB--file\fP}\ \fIFILENAME\fP
option is specified, the supplied file contains M2UA-AS configuration entries as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Each line in the file contains one entry or comment per line.
.IP \(bu
Each entry consists of a number of fields separated by whitespace.
.IP \(bu
Any field that begins with an octothorpe character,
.RB ` # ',
is a comment that continues to the end of the line.
.IP \(bu
Any line containing only a comment (beginning with optional whitespace followed by an octothorpe
character,
.RB ` # ')
is ignored.
.IP \(bu
Blank lines are ignored.
.PP
Each line containing an M2UA-AS configuration entry consists of the following fields:
.PP
.RI < sgid >
.RI < aspid >
.RI < options >
.RI < local-endpoint >
.RI < remote-endpoint >
.PP
Where,
.TP
.I sgid
is an SG identifier that is an integer number identifying an ASP-SG relation (i.e. SCTP
association).
.TP
.I aspid
is an ASP Identifier that will be used in the ASP Up request to the SG.  If this field is specified
as zero
.RB ( 0 ),
or as a single dash,
.RB ( - ),
then no ASP Identifier will be used in the ASP Up request to the SG.
.TP
.I options
is a list of comma-separated SG options, with no embedded whitespace.  The following options are
defined:
.RS
.TP
.B dynamic
When included in the options, this keyword specifies that the SG requires dynamic configuration
(registration).  If this option is not included, the SG requires static configuration (no
registration).
.RE
.TP
.I local-endpoint
is the local endpoint address to which the SCTP association is bound to communicate with the remote
SG.  This can take the form:
{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}[\fB,\fR{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}][\fB:\fR{\fIport\fR|\fIservice\fR}].
The special hostname consisting of a single star,
.RB ( * ),
can be used to indicate a wildcard address.  When the wildcard address is used, only one
.IR hostname " or " ipaddress
can occur in the address.  If the
.IR port " or " service
is not specified, then a dynamic port number will be allocated.  If the
.I service
is specified as
.RB \(lq m2ua ,\(rq
then the M2UA registered (well-known) port number will be used.
.TP
.I remote-endpoint
is the remote endpoint address to which the SCTP association is connected to communicate with the
remote SG.  This can take the form:
{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}[\fB,\fR{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}][\fB:\fR{\fIport\fR|\fIservice\fR}].
If the
.IR port " or " service
is not specified, the M2UA registered (well-known) port number will be used.
.PP
The
.B m2uaasconf
utility, reads this configuration file and performs the following steps for each entry in the file:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The
.B m2uaasconf
utility opens an SCTP association by opening the
.B /dev/sctp_t
device, or the device specified with the
.B -s
option.
.IP 2.
The
.B m2uaasconf
utility opens a stream on the M2UA-AS driver using the
.B /dev/m2ua-as
device, or the device specified by the
.B -e
option, and links the SCTP stream under the M2UA-AS multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
input-output control.
The
.B m2uaasconf
utility can then close the file descriptor for the SCTP stream.
.IP 3.
The
.B m2uaasconf
utility uses the
.B M2UA_AS_IOCSCONFIG
input-output control to associated the lower multiplex SCTP stream with an ASP-SG relation.  The
input-output control takes the information provided in the configuration file line entry, and the
multiplexer identifier returned from the
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
input-output control operation.  The M2UA-AS driver, in response to the
.B M2UA_AS_IOCSCONFIG
input-output control, complets the ASP-SG relation information as part of the lower multiplex stream
private structure.  The M2UA-AS driver also binds and connects the SCTP association and attempts to
bring the ASP to the ASP Up state with the remote SG.
.IP 4.
Steps 1 thorugh 3, above, are repeated for each entry in the configuration file.
.IP 5.
The utility can also open and attach signalling links streams and link them under the SL-MUX
multiplexing driver with a global PPA and CLEI.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1) indicates that an
error occured and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message is printed on
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
options suppresses the printing of diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .

.B m2uaasconf
is an OpenSS7-specific configuration command.  Because this command is used at startup and is
transparent to the SL-User operaning SL streams, compatibility is not an issue.
