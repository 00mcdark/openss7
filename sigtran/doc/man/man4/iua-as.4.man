.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The IUA-AS is a multiplexing driver that implements the ASP side of the IUA
.[
iuarfc
.]
protocol.
Streams opened on the upper multiplex provide the
.IR "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)",
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7).
Streams linked under the lower multiplex provide the
.IR "Transport Provider Interface (TPI)",
.[
tpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
for SCTP,
.BR sctp_t (4).
.\"
.SS Configuration
.PP
When the IUA-AS driver is configured, SCTP Streams are opened and linked under the multiplexing
driver.  Each SCTP stream represents an association between a local ASP (Application Server Process)
and a remote SG (Signalling Gateway).  Input-output controls are used to configure each lower
multiplex Stream.  Once a lower multiplex Stream is configured, the IUA-AS driver attempts to form
an SCTP association with the remote SG, and to bring IUA association to the ASP Up state.  Should
the association be dropped, the ASP-SG relation is moved to the ASP Down state and the IUA-AS driver
attempts to reconnect the association and bring it to the ASP Up state again and activate all active
interfaces.
.PP
Once configured, DL Streams can be opened on the upper multiplex.  These DL Streams are not
associated with an ASP-SG association until they are attached.  When the
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive is issued, the PPA contained in the request is composed of an SG identifier and an
Interface Identifier.  This information is sufficient for the IUA-AS driver to determine the
association for the interface.  When the
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive is issued, the assigned Interface Identifier is used to activate the interface with the
remote SG, if the interface has not already been activated with the remote SG.
.PP
After the link has been attached with the
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive, it can be linked beneath the DL-MUX multiplexing device driver and assigned a CLEI and
global PPA.
.PP
Configuration is performed using an IUA-AS driver configuration utility,
.BR iuaasconf (8).
This utility reads a configuration file used to define the objects necessary for configuration.  The
configuration file contains entries that define ASP-SG relationships as follows:
.TP
.I sgid
An integer number identifying the ASP-SG relation.
.I aspid
The ASPID that is used in communication with the SG.  This ASPID can be null (a single dash,
.RB ( - ))
indicating that no ASPID is to be used in communication with the SG.  This ASPID corresponds also to
the value zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.TP
.I streams
The number of SCTP streams that will be requested to the SG.
.TP
.I local-endpoint
The local endpoint address to which an SCTP association is bound to communicate with the remote SG.
This can take the form:
{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}[\fB,\fR{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}][\fB:\fR{\fIport\fR|\fIservice\fR}].
The special hostname consisting of a single star,
.RB ( * ),
can be used to indicate a wildcard address.  If the
.IR port " or " service
is not specified, then a dynamic port number will be allocated.  If the service is specified as
.BR iua ,
then the IUA registered (well-known) port number will be used.
.[
iuarfc
.]
.TP
.I remote-endpoint
The remote endpoint address to which an SCTP association wil connect to communicate with the remote
SG.  This can take the form:
{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}[\fB,\fR{\fIhostname\fR|\fIipaddress\fR}][\fB:\fR{\fIport\fR|\fIservice\fR}].
If the
.IR port " or " service
is not specified, the IUA registered (well-known) port number will be used.
.[
iuarfc
.]
.TP
.I options
Contains a comma separated list of SG options, with no embedded whitespace.  The following options
are defined: (there are currently no SG options for IUA).
.PP
The configuration utility reads this configuration file and performs the following steps for each
entry in the file:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The utility opens an SCTP association by opening the
.B /dev/sctp_t
device, or the device specified by the
.B -s
option.
.IP 2.
The utility opens a stream on the IUA-AS driver using the
.B /dev/iua-as
device, or the device specified by the
.B -e
option, and links the SCTP stream under the IUA-AS multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
input-output control.  The utility can then close the file descriptor for the SCTP stream.
.IP 3.
The utility uses the
.B IUA_AS_IOCSCONFIG
input-output control to associate the lower multiplex SCTP stream with the ASP-SG relation.  The
input-output control takes the information provided in the configuration file line entry, and the
multiplexer identifier returned from the
.IR I_LINK "(7) or " I_PLINK (7)
input-output control operation.  The IUA-AS driver, in response to the
.B IUA_AS_IOCSCONFIG
input-output control, completes the ASP-SG relation information as part of the lower multiplex
stream private structure.  The IUA-AS driver also binds and connects the SCTP association and
attempts to bring the ASP to the ASP Up state with the remote SG.
.IP 4.
Steps 1 through 3, above, are repeated for each entry in the configuration file.
.IP 5.
The utility can also open and attach data link streams and link them under the DL-MUX multiplexing
driver with a global PPA and CLEI.
