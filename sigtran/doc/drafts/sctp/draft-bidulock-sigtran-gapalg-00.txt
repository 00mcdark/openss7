    Abstract

    This  Internet Draft describes an algorithm for the tracking and genera-
    tion of SACK Gap and Duplicate TSN reports.  This algorithm has been im-
    plemented in the OpenSS7 Linux Kernel implementation of SCTP [RFC 2960].


    1.  Introduction

    This internet-draft provides an algorithm for tracking gap and duplicate
    TSN  SACK  reports  for  the Stream Control Transmission Protocol as de-
    scribed in [RFC 2960].

    There are several difficulties to consider when  attempting  implementa-
    tion of the Gap and Duplicate TSN reports in SCTP:


    i)   The algorithm must support a quick determination of whether the TSN
         is a duplicate TSN.

    ii)  The algorithm must support a quick determination of whether the TSN
         falls within an existing SACK'ed TSN range.

    iii) The  algorithm  must support counting duplicates accumulated over a
         number of SCTP messages but be able to be cleared quickly as a  Du-
         plicate TSN report is generated.

    iv)  The algorithm must support on demand generation of Gap Reports.

    v)   The algorithm must consume a finite and bounded amount of memory.

    vi)  The algorithm must smoothly interwork with the SCTP's procedures.

    The  algortihm  presented in this internet-draft attempts to meet all of
    these objectives and provide a compact solution.
