Abstract

   This Internet Draft defines an interworking architecture and function
   for  providing  seamless and transparent interworking between the SS7
   newtork and and IP network at SS7 Level 3  (MTP  -  Message  Transfer
   Part)  for  providing  IP host-based MTP User Parts within an IP net-
   work.  This architecture permits IP hosts performing an MTP User Part
   function  to  appears  as though they are normal SEPs (Signalling End
   Points) or STPs (Signalling Transfer Points) withing the SS7 network,
   while acting normally within the IP domain.  The gateway function de-
   scribed here is an  SG  (Signalling  Gateway)  interworking  function
   which provides this capability at the boundary of the SS7 and IP net-
   works.  This specifiction is independent  of  IP  transport,  however
   candidates are UDP, TCP, RDP, RUDP, and SCTP.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Scope

   A need has been identified for providing seamless and transparent in-
   terworking between SS7 and IP networks for the  purposes  of  placing
   application  in  the  IP  domain  which service the SS7 domain.  This
   would permit IP host applications whcih are located in the IP  domain
   to  provide  services into an SS7 network as though they we a part of
   that SS7 network.  The intention of this MTP3 Gateway Architecture is
   as follows:

    + permit  the application to only be concerned with IP related rout-
      ing and tasks.
    + Gateways) acting as SEPs (Signalling End  Points)  or  STPs  (Sig-
      nalling  Transfer  Points)  to remain conformant to SS7 specifica-
      tions without compromising the IP network philosophy.

1.2.  Terminology

   Signalling Gateway (SG)

   Signalling End Point (SEP)
      An SEP (Signalling End Point) is  an  SS7  SP  (Signalling  Point)
      which  originates  and terminates MTP (Message Transfer Part) User
      traffic.

   Signalling Transfer Point (STP)
      An STP (Signalling Transfer Point) is an SS7 SP (Signalling Point)
      which  can forward or relay SS7 MTP messages which are destined to
      an SS7 SP (Signalling Point) which is distant or remote  from  the
      point in question.
