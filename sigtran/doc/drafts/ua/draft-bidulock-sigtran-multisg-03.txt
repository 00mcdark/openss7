Abstract

     This Internet-Draft describes Load Selection for Signalling User
  Adaptation Protocols [M3UA, SUA..TUA], which permits an Application
  Server Processes (ASP) to indicate its placement within an Application
  Server and permits an Signalling Gateway (SG) to distribute traffic
  over ASPs in Application Servers under Application Server Process
  (ASP) control.

Internet Draft                 UA MULTI-SG             February 21, 2004

Contents

     A complete table of contents, list of tables and illustrations, and
  change history appears at the end of this document.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Scope

     This Internet-Draft provides parameters and procedures in extension
  to the parameters and procedures of the Signalling User Adaptation
  Layers (UAs) [M3UA, SUA..TUA], for the purpose of supporting
  Application Servers interworking with multiple Signalling Gateways to
  the SS7 Network.

     UA implementations with Multiple SG Support are intended to be
  compatible with UA implementations not supporting this configuration.

     MULTI-SG is only applicable to Signalling Gateway (SG)-Application
  Server Process (ASP) configurations in which ASP are supporting
  Application Server (AS) connectivity to an SS7 network via multiple
  SGs.[1] MULTI-SG is not applicable to configurations of IPSPs working
  in a point-to-point network without relay points.[2]

1.2.  Terminology

     Multiple SG Support (MULTI-SG) supplements the terminology used in
  the UA documents [M3UA, SUA..TUA] by adding the following terms:

  Multiple SG Support (MULTI-SG) - the parameters and procedures
      provided in this document.

  Signalling User Adaptation Layer (UA) - one or more of the Stream
      Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC 2960] SS7 Signalling
      User Adaptation Layers [M3UA, SUA..TUA] supporting the concept of
      a Routing Context.

1.3.  Overview

     MULTI-SG provides procedures in addition to the UA procedures[3]
  that provides for seamless interworking of SS7 Network Management with
  Application Server Processes (ASPs) supporting Application Servers
  (AS) to multiple Signalling Gateways (SGs).  MULTI-SG procedures
  provide support for the following functions not provided for in the
  existing UA documents:

   + Support for fail-over of SCTP associations between Signalling
     Gateways (SGs).
   + Support for rerouting of traffic destined to Signalling Endpoints
     (SEP) in SS7 Network between Signalling Gateways (SGs).
   + Support for seamless interworking with SS7 Changeback [Q.704]
     procedures towards the SS7 Network for rerouting of traffic between
     SGs for elminating message mis-sequencing across the interworking
     point between the SS7 and IP networks.

Internet Draft                 UA MULTI-SG             February 21, 2004

     MUTLI-SG supplements the procedures for the diversion of traffic
  during fail-over or restoration of ASPs, SGPs and IPSPs already
  provided for in "Correlation Id and Heartbeat Procedures (CORID)
  Supporting Lossless Fail-Over between SCTP Associations" [CORID].  The
  benefits of MULTI-SG can, nevertheless, be supported indepedent from
  CORID [CORID]

1.3.1.  Multiple SGs

     No procedures are described which provide for reduction of message
  loss, duplication or mis-sequencing in multiple SG configurations in
  the existing UA procedures.

1.3.1.1.  Fail-over of routesets between SGs

1.3.1.2.  Redirection of routesets between SGs

         Figure 1.  Example (A) Sample Multiple-SG Configuration


     A typical Example (A) configuration multiple Signalling Gateways is
  illustrated in Figure 1.  In this configuration a number of
  Application Server Processes (ASPs) serving a number of Application
  Servers (ASs) are connected to two Signalling Gateways (SGs).  The SGs
  appear as mated SS7 Signalling Transfer Points (STPs) [Q.705] to the

  SS7 Network.  Traffic originating at Signalling Endpoints (SEP) in the
  SS7 network and directed toward SEP in the IP network (i.e.,
  Application Servers) is loadshared over the STPs by the Signalling
  Link Selection (SLS) [Q.704] value associated with each message.
  Traffic originating at the SEP in the IP network (i.e, AS) is
  loadshared over the SGs in the same fashion.
