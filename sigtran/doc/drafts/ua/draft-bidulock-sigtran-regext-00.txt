Abstract

      This memo describes Registration Extensions that provides the
   ability for an Application Server Process (ASP) to modify existing
   Routing Keys (RKs) with a Signalling Gateway (SG).

      Current procedures in the SS7 Signalling User Adaptation Layers
   (UAs) do not provide for the modification of Routing Keys (RKs)
   without deactivation of the Application Server (AS).  This causes
   problems in making changes to live systems.

      The extensions described in this memo permit modification of
   Signalling Link membership in Application Servers for SS7 MTP2-User

   Adaptation Layer [M2UA], modification of Circuit Identification Code
   (CIC) ranges for the SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer [M3UA],
   modificiation of Destination Local Reference (DLR) ranges for SS7
   SCCP-User Adaptation Layer [SUA10], and modification of Transaction
   Identifier (TID) ranges for SS7 TCAP-User Adaptation Layer [TUA01].

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Scope

      This Internet-Draft provides parameters and procedures in
   extension to the parameters and procedures of the SS7 Signalling User
   Adaptation Layers (UAs) [M2UA, M3UA, SUA10, TUA01], for the purpose
   of supporting changed to Routing Keys to be made in live systems.

      UA implementations with REGEXT are intended to be compatible with
   UA implementations not supporting this extension.

1.2.  Terminology

      REGEXT adds the following terms to the terminology presented in
   the UA documents:

   Registration Extension - The parameters and procedures described by
      this memo.

   Signalling Peer Process - refers to an ASP, SGP or IPSP.

   Signalling User Adaptation Layer (UA) - one or more of the Stream
      Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC 2960] SS7 Signalling
      User Adaptation Layers [M2UA, M3UA, SUA10, TUA01] supporting
      Registration.

1.3.  Overview

      Existing registration mangement procedures do not provide for the
   alteration of Routing Keys on live systems.  This can lead to
   significant operational difficulties in large scale deployments.
   This memo provides extension procedures that permit this
   modification.

1.3.1.  Limitations of Existing Registration Management

      Each of the UAs [M2UA, M3UA, SUA10, TUA01] provides procedures for
   registration and deregistration of Routing (Link) Keys.  None of
   these procedures currently provides for alteration of Routing Keys
   for a Application Server (AS) in the active state.

      In SS7 MTP2-User Adaptation Layer [M2UA] registration of a Link
   Key associates a signalling link with an Interface Identifier (IID).
   However, registration does not provide a mechanism for associating
   groups of Interface Identifiers (IID) together into Application
   Servers (AS), nor does it provide a mechanism for altering the
   membership of signalling links associated with an Application Server.

      The SS7 MTP3-User Adaptation Layer [M3UA] registration of a
   Routing Key associates a range of tranffic with an Application Server
   through a Routing Context.  However, it does not provide procedures
   for changing the range of traffic associated with an Application
   Server and Routing Context without deactivating the Application
   Server and deregistering the Routing Key.  This can cause
   difficulties when M3UA is used in support of ISUP MTP3-Users where
   normal circuit management expects to add and remove specific circuits
   or ranges of circuits (circuit groups) to and from Application
   Servers.

      The SS7 SCCP-User Adaptation Layer [SUA10] registration of a
   Routing Key associates a range of traffic with an Application Server
   through a Routing Context and the Address Mapping Fucntion.  However,
   it does not provide procedures for changing the range of traffic
   associated with an Application Server and Routing Context without
   deactivating the Application Server and deregistering the Routing
   Key.  This can cause difficulties when SUA is used in the connection-
   oriented environment and the ASP wishes to dynamically assign
   connections to Application Servers.

      The SS7 TCAP-User Adapatation Layer [TUA01] registration of a
   Routing Key associates a range of traffic wtih an Application Server
   through a Routing Context and the Transaction Mapping Function.
   However, it does not provide procedures for changing the range of
   traffic associated with an Application Server and Routing Context
   without deactivating the Application Server and deregistering the
   Routing Key.  This can cause difficulties when TUA is used in
   operations class 1, 2 and 3 (dialogues) and the ASP wishes to
   dynamically assign dialogues to Application Servers.

1.3.2.  Registration Extension

      This memo provides extensions for the UA registration and
   dregistration procedures which addresses these limitations in the
   existing prcoedures.  REGEXT provide the following

1.3.2.1.  M2UA

1.3.2.2.  M3UA

1.3.2.3.  SUA

1.3.2.4.  TUA

2.  Conventions

      The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in

3.  Protocol Elements

      The following subsections describe the parameters which are added
   or whose use is modified by this extension, their format and the
   messages in which they are used.

3.1.  Parameters

      Registration Extensions does not add any new parameters, but
   permits the use of the Routing Context parameter within a Routing Key
   parameter.  It also allows the use of the Routing Key parameter
   within a DEREG REQ message.

3.1.1.  Routing Key

      REGEXT augments the Link Key parameter of M2UA [M2UA] and the
   Routing Key parameters of M3UA, SUA, and TUA [M3UA, SUA10, TUA01].

3.1.1.1.  M2UA Link Key

3.1.1.2.  M3UA Routing Key

      The Routing Key parameter is used in the REG REQ and DEREG REQ
   messages.  It is used to identify the portion of traffic for which an
   ASP is registering or deregistering.

      The Routing Key parameter is formatted as follows:

   The Routing Key parameter contains the following sub-parameters:

   Local-RK-Identifier parameter: TLV

     The mandatory Locak-RK-Identifier parameter is used to uniquely
     identify the registration request.  The Local-RK-Identifier value
     is assigned by the ASP, and is used to correlate the response in an
     REG RSP message with the original registration request.  THe Locak-
     RK-Identifier value must remain unique until the REG RSP message is
     received.

     The format of the Local-RK-Identifier is as follows:
