Abstract

      This memo describes Session Id Registration that provides the
   ability for one (listening) Application Server to indicate that a
   session should be established with another (accepting) Application
   Server for connection- and transaction-oriented messaging the in SS7
   Signalling User Adaptation Layers [M3UA, SUA09, TUA01].  Extension
   parameters and procedures are added by this memo in extension to
   those of the User Adaptation layers to provide a closer model to that
   of the XNS/XTI interfaces, where one interface may be designated as a
   `listener' and another designated as an `acceptor'.  This permits ISO
   compliant interfaces for SCCP to maintain the same semantic for SUA
   and TUA.
