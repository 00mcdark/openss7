@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This is the fourth open source release of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package.  This release
contains modules and drivers formerly only available with Commercial releases of the @file{strss7}
package and which are only recently available as open source with the release of this package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release @file{openss7-0.9.2.D}, the SIGTRAN and SS7 over IP components
were separated from the @file{strss7} package and placed in this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN
components previously part of the @file{strss7} package have been strapped into this release.
Components will be re-validated against @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} on a module-by-module and
driver-by-driver basis.  See @file{TODO} in the release, or @refman{Schedule}, for information about
the release schedule.

This is a stable, production grade release of M2PA.  It deprecates previous SIGTRAN component
releases from the @file{strss7} package.  Please upgrade to the most current release of these
components before reporting bugs.  This release is a maintenance release and provides support for
recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

@itemize -
@item
Minor documentation corrections.

@item
Kernel module license made explicit "GPL v2".  And then changed back to "GPL".

@item
License upgrade to @cite{AGPL Version 3}.

@item
Improvements to common build process for embedded and cross-compile targets.

@item
Modifications to build under @cite{Fedora} @samp{2.6.25-45.fc9} and @samp{2.6.26.5-45.fc9} kernels.

@item

@item
Updated references database for manual pages and roff documents.

@item

for DEBs.  Installation documentation has been updated to include details of repository install
sourcesref.

@item
Added @constant{MODULE_VERSION} to all modules and drivers.

@item
Added SG (Signalling Gateway) project document.

@end itemize

@emph{This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it deprecates previous
releases.  Please upgrade to the current release before reporting bugs.}

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on
production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the @cite{GNU Affero General Public License Version 3}.  The
release is available as an @command{autoconf} tarball, SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.
See the @uref{http://www.openss7.org/download.html,downloads page} for the @command{autoconf}
tarballs, SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
@uref{http://www.openss7.org/@value{PACKAGE}_pkg.html,@value{PACKAGE} package page}.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the @command{@value{PACKAGE}} release.

This is the initial open source release of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}
package.  This release contains modules and drivers formerly only available
with Commercial releases of the @file{strss7} package and which are only
recently available as open source with the release of this package.

With OpenSS7 Master Package release @file{openss7-0.9.2.D}, the SIGTRAN and SS7
over IP components were separated from the @file{strss7} package and placed in
this package.  Not all of the SIGTRAN components previously part of the
@file{strss7} package have been strapped into this release.  Components will
be re-validated against @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} on a module-by-module
and driver-by-driver basis.  See @file{TODO} in the release, or
@refman{Schedule}, for information about the release schedule.

In this initial release, the major component first available is M2PA.
@manpage{m2pa_sl(4)} is a pushable @dfn{STREAMS} module that is pushed over a
@manpage{sctp_n(4)} SCTP driver Stream to form an M2PA signalling link
providing the Signalling Link service interface (@manpage{sli(7)}).  A
complete test suite that tests to @file{draft-bidulock-sigtran-m2pa-07.txt} is
included in the release.  The historical SS7 over IP implementations are
provided, but without conformance test suites.  The release also contains
simplified AS modules for M2UA (@manpage{m2ua_as(4)}), M3UA
(@manpage{m3ua_as(4)}) that as yet do not have a conformance test suite.

Subsequent releases in 1Q 2007 will include the additional full M3UA, SUA and
TUA multiplexing drivers with conformance test suites.  The objective is to
have these components publicly available before the SIGTRAN Interoperability
test event in April 2007.

This is a stable, production grade release of M2PA for @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}.  It deprecates previous SIGTRAN component releases from the
@file{strss7} package.  Please upgrade to the most current release of these
components before reporting bugs.
