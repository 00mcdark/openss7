Install Fedora 9 and set it up.

configure gave then message that it cannot do a headless build.
Need kernel-source package, kernel-devel package or kernel-headers package.

sudo yum install kernel-devel

same message, try

sudo yum install kernel-headers

still didn't work, they were newer versions: did

sudo yum update

and update 400 and some packages.
