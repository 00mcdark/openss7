	* acinclude.m4: add check for <net/request_sock.h> for 2.6.13 kernels.
	  I finally stumbled across a 2.6.13 kernel (in SuSE 10) that has a
	  request_sock structure but no inet_csk().  This handles that case.
	  Also, xfrm_policy_delete returns int on 2.6.13+.
	* src/drivers/inet.c: handles request_sock with no inet_connection_sock
	* src/drivers/udp.c (udp_open, udp_close): gcc 4 does not like different
	  attributes between declaration and definition.
	* src/drivers/rawip.c (rawip_open, rawip_close): gcc 4 does not like
	  different attributes between declaration and definition.
	* src/drivers/udp_hooks.h.in: xfrm_policy_delete returns int on 2.6.13+.

	* src/drivers/inet.c: significant changes to the INET driver
	  - largely rewrote ss_sock_sendmsg
	  - ss_sock_sendmsg has been causing some problems over the last number
	    of releases.  This version queues messages retrieved from the socket
	    on the read queue when there are buffer allocation failures.
	  - optimizations
