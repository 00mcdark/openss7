OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.5 of the STREAMS INET for Linux NET4 <em>strinet</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 INET Networking package is an implementation of the Internet Protocol suite for Linux
Fast-STREAMS directly over Linux NET4 Sockets implementation, using a STREAMS over Sockets approach.
This permits modules to be pushed on UDP or TCP Streams and allows use of the XTI/TLI library with
Internet Protocols on Linux.  The package now also includes direct STREAMS implementations of RAW IP
and UDP, and will include direct implementations of TI loopback devices and TCP in the future.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
