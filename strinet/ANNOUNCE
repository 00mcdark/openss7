Package strinet-0.9.2.4 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-08.

The OpenSS7 INET Networking package is an implementation of the Internet
Protocol suite for Linux Fast-STREAMS directly over Linux NET4 Sockets
implementation, using a STREAMS over Sockets approach.  This permits
modules to be pushed on UDP or TCP Streams and allows use of the XTI/TLI
library with Internet Protocols on Linux.  The package now also includes
direct STREAMS implementations of RAW IP and UDP, and will include
direct implementations of TI loopback devices and TCP in the future.

The package currently includes the following STREAMS kernel modules and
drivers:

     - streams_inet.ko /dev/ip others
     - streams_udp.ko /dev/udp2
     - streams_rawip.ko /dev/rawip2
     - streams_tcp.ko /dev/tcp2

inet(4)
     The inet(4) driver is a classical STREAMS over Sockets approach.
     Transport Provider Interface, tpi(7), Streams are interworked into
     a socket opened within the driver.  This approach has some serious
     disadvantages, one of them being speed.

udp2(4)
     The udp2(4) driver is a second-generation STREAMS UPD driver.  This
     driver is mostly a STREAMS implementation and only relies on the
     Linux IP layer for operation.  No socket is opened internal to the
     kernel.  This driver performs much faster than the STREAMS over
     Sockets approach and rivals the native Sockets implemented under
     Linux in terms of performance.  This driver is well tested with the
     test-udp test case executable.

rawip2(4)
     The rawip2(4) driver is a second-generation STREAMS raw IP driver.
     It is similar to the second-generation UDP driver.  This driver is
     well tested with the test-rawip test case executable.

tcp2(4)
     The tcp2(4) driver is a placeholder for a second-generation STREAMS
     TCP driver.


The OpenSS7 INET Networking package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of
Internet Protocols (INET) protocol stack components and applications for
the Linux Fast-STREAMS environment.

This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate add-on package release
of the OpenSS7 INET Networking package that was formerly present in the
(now deprecated) LiS package.  The networking drivers are provided, as
well as the TPI and XTI header files for INET and loopback operation.
The package contains all the necessary manual pakges and other
documentation for INET components in a spearate autoconf tarball.  This
release is a stable, production grade release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and
is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is both a maintenance release and a feature release.  The
major new feature added is a fully STREAMS based implementation of the
rawip(4) and udp(4) drivers.  This release is a stable production
release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of
this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Fixed buffer leak in ss_sock_sendmsg reported by John Wenker.
     Significant rewrite of the ss_sock_sendmsg function.  Loader
     optimizations for streams-inet driver.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     `strinet' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new `--with-optimize' option
     to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the

packages and other documentation for INET components in a separate
autoconf tarball. This release is a stable, production grade release
for Linux Fast-STREAMS and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package
(openss7-0.9.2.F).

This release is primarily a maintenance release to support recent
distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

  - Staggering performance improvements. The performance
    improvements/correction provided in the streams-0.9.2.3 Linux
    Fast-STREAMS package and a little bit of performance tuning of the
    streams-inet and streams-udp drivers has resulted in staggering
    performance improvements.

  - STREAMS XTIoS TCP now runs up to 300% faster than Linux TCP in
    tests. See the TCP Performance page for more information
    <http://www.openss7.org/tcp_perf.html>.

  - STREAMS UDP now runs up to 60% faster than Linux UDP in tests.
    See the UDP Performance page for more information
    <http://www.openss7.org/udp_perf.html>.

  - Support build on openSUSE 10.2.
  - Support build on Fedora 7 with 2.6.21 kernel.
  - Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).
  - Support build on Ubuntu 7.04.
  - Updated to gettext 0.16.1.

  - Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 and
    2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 kernel.

  - Supports build on Fedora Core 6.
  - Support for recent distributions and tool chains.

This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases. Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and
