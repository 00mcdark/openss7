strinet-0.9.2.4 was released under GPLv2 on March 30, 2006.

STREAMS INET is an implementation of Internet Protocol for Linux
Fast-STREAMS directly over the Linux NET4 Sockets implementation, using
a STREAMS over Sockets approach.  This permits modules to be pushed on
UDP or TCP Streams and allows use of the XTI/TLI library with Internet
Protocols on Linux.

This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate release of the OpenSS7
STREAMS INET driver that was formerly present in the (now deprecated)
Linux STREAMS (LiS) package.  The networking driver (streams-inet) is
provided, as well as the TPI and XTI header files for INET operation.
The package contains all the necessary manual pages and other
documentation for INET components in a separate autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

This release is a maintenance release.  It provides the following
enhancements and fixes:

  - Added --enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.

  - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

  - Fixed buffer leak in ss_sock_sendmsg reported by John Wenker.

  - Significant rewrite of the ss_sock_sendmsg function.

  - Loader optimizations for streams-inet driver.

 This is a public gamma release of the package: it deprecates previous
 packages.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
 packages.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strinet package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strinet_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strinet-0.9.2.4/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strinet-0.9.2.4/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strinet.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strinet_manual.html>).

strinet-0.9.2.4 was released under GPLv2 on March 30, 2006.

The OpenSS7 INET Networking package is an implementation of the Internet
Protocol suite for Linux Fast-STREAMS directly over Linux NET4 Sockets
implementation, using a STREAMS over Sockets approach.  This permits
modules to be pushed on UDP or TCP Streams and allows use of the XTI/TLI
library with Internet Protocols on Linux.  The package now also includes
direct STREAMS implementations of RAW IP and UDP, and will include
direct implementations of TI loopback devices and TCP in the future.

This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate add-on package release
of the OpenSS7 INET Networking package that was formerly present in the
(now deprecated) LiS package.  The networking drivers are provided, as
well as the TPI and XTI header files for INET and loopback operation.
The package contains all the necessary manual pakges and other
documentation for INET components in a spearate autoconf tarball.  This
release is a stable, production grade release for Linux Fast-STREAMS and
is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).

This release is both a maintenance release and a feature release.  The
major new feature added is a fully STREAMS based implementation of the
rawip(4) and udp(4) drivers.  This release is a stable production
release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of
this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Fixed buffer leak in ss_sock_sendmsg reported by John Wenker.
     Significant rewrite of the ss_sock_sendmsg function.  Loader
     optimizations for streams-inet driver.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for LiS.

   - Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     strinet now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc
     compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions
     (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new --with-optimize option
     to configure to accomplish this.

   - Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strinet package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strinet_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strinet-0.9.2.4/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strinet-0.9.2.4/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strinet.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strinet_manual.html>).
