strinet-0.9.2.4 was released under GPLv2 on March 30, 2006.

STREAMS INET is an implementation of Internet Protocol for Linux
Fast-STREAMS directly over the Linux NET4 Sockets implementation, using
a STREAMS over Sockets approach.  This permits modules to be pushed on
UDP or TCP Streams and allows use of the XTI/TLI library with Internet
Protocols on Linux.

This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate release of the OpenSS7
STREAMS INET driver that was formerly present in the (now deprecated)
Linux STREAMS (LiS) package.  The networking driver (streams-inet) is
provided, as well as the TPI and XTI header files for INET operation.
The package contains all the necessary manual pages and other
documentation for INET components in a separate autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

This release is a maintenance release.  It provides the following
enhancements and fixes:

  - Added --enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.

  - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

  - Fixed buffer leak in ss_sock_sendmsg reported by John Wenker.

 This is a public gamma release of the package: it deprecates previous
 packages.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
 packages.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strinet package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strinet_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strinet-0.9.2.4/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strinet-0.9.2.4/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strinet.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strinet_manual.html>).
