strinet-0.9.2.3 was released under GPLv2 on March 15, 2006.

STREAMS INET is an implementation of Internet Protocol for Linux
Fast-STREAMS directly over the Linux NET4 Sockets implementation, using
a STREAMS over Sockets approach.  This permits modules to be pushed on
UDP or TCP Streams and allows use of the XTI/TLI library with Internet
Protocols on Linux.

This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate release of the OpenSS7
STREAMS INET driver that was formerly present in the (now deprecated)
Linux STREAMS (LiS) package.  The networking driver (streams-inet) is
provided, as well as the TPI and XTI header files for INET operation.
The package contains all the necessary manual pages and other
documentation for INET components in a separate autoconf tarball.

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

This is primarily a maintenance release.  Validated for operation on
x86_64 SMP kernel using Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Changes included to handle
__LP64__ kernels.  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels
as reported on mailing list.  Corrects several bugs reported by project
sponsors.  It includes:

 - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support
   32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary
   compatibility should not have been disrupted.  At the same time as
   the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of the IO
   controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

 - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

 - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
   x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
   compiler warnings.

 - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
   mailing list.

 - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
   Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
   N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

 - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on
   x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

 This is a public gamma release of the package: it deprecates previous
 packages.  Please upgrade before reporting problems with previous
 packages.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds rpms for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based
distributions, and can be used on production kernels without patching or
recompiling the kernel.

This package is released under the 'GNU Public License Version 2'.  The
release is available as an autoconf/RPM tarball, SRPM and set of binary
RPMs.  See the download page <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> for
the autoconf tarballs and SRPMs.  See the strinet package page at
<http://www.openss7.org/strinet_pkg.html> for tarballs, SRPMs and binary
RPMs.

See <http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strinet-0.9.2.3/ChangeLog> and
<http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strinet-0.9.2.3/NEWS> in the release
for more information.  Also, see the strinet.pdf manual in the release
(also in html <http://www.openss7.org/strinet_manual.html>).
