This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate add-on package release of the OpenSS7 INET
Networking package that was formerly present in the (now deprecated) LiS package.  The networking
drivers are provided, as well as the TPI and XTI header files for INET and loop-back operation.  The
package contains all the necessary manual packages and other documentation for INET components in a
separate autoconf tarball.  This release is a stable, production grade release for Linux
Fast-STREAMS and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.F).

This release is primarily a maintenance release to support recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Staggering performance improvements.  The performance improvements/correction provided in the
<tt>streams-0.9.2.3</tt> Linux Fast-STREAMS package and a little bit of performance tuning of the
<code>streams-inet</code> and <code>streams-udp</code> drivers has resulted in staggering
performance improvements.<bdo/></li>
<li>STREAMS XTIoS TCP now runs up to 300% faster than Linux TCP in tests.  See the <a
href="tcp_perf.html">TCP Performance</a> page for more information.<bdo/></li>
<li>STREAMS UDP now runs up to 60% faster than Linux UDP in tests.  See the <a
href="udp_perf.html">UDP Performance</a> page for more information.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support build on openSUSE 10.2.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support build on Fedora 7 with 2.6.21 kernel.<bdo/></li>
<li>Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).<bdo/></li>
<li>Support build on Ubuntu 7.04.<bdo/></li>
<li>Updated to gettext 0.16.1.<bdo/></li>
<li>Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 and 2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 kernel.<bdo/></li>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.6 of the STREAMS INET for Linux NET4 <em>strinet</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 INET Networking package is an implementation of the Internet Protocol suite for Linux
Fast-STREAMS directly over Linux NET4 Sockets implementation, using a STREAMS over Sockets approach.
This permits modules to be pushed on UDP or TCP Streams and allows use of the XTI/TLI library with
Internet Protocols on Linux.  The package now also includes direct STREAMS implementations of RAW IP
and UDP, and will include direct implementations of TI loop-back devices and TCP in the future.

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds RPMs and DEBs
for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM- and DPKG-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
