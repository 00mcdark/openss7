5.5.2 Known Defects
-------------------

With the exception of packages not originaly created by the `OpenSS7 Project',
the `OpenSS7 Project' software does not ship with known bugs in any release
stage except "pre-alpha".  "Linux Fast-STREAMS" had no known bugs at the time
of release.

Nevertheless, this file contains bugs encountered during development and
their resolutions.  The OpenSS7 Project does not release software with
known bugs, so this list serves two purposes:

1. It captures bugs encountered between releases during development that
   could possibly reoccur (and the Moon is made of blue cheese).  It
   therefore provides a place for users to look if they encounter a
   problem.

2. I provides a low overhead bug list between releases for developers to
   use as a TODO list.

Bugs
----

001. Several test cases are failing sending messages.  ICMP port
     unreachable errors are resulting.  It appears that the caching of
     destination addresses is somehow making the receiver think that it
     is a connection-oriented stream!
