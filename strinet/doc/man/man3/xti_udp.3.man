.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
This manual page describes the XTI interface for UDP in accordance with XNS 5.2.
.[
xns99
.]
.PP
The X/Open Transport Interface
.[
xns99
.]
specifies addressing and options for User Datagram Protocol (UDP).  Although this
interface is always exposed by including the
.RB < xti.h >
header file, it is provided by the
.RB < xti_udp.h >
header file included by the former.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual section describes the protocol-specific information that is
relevant for UDP transport providers.  This section also describes the
protocol-specific information that is relevant when UDP services are provided
over an IP network using UDP.
.PP
This section also defines the data structures and constants required for UDP
transport providers that are exposed through the
.RB < xti.h >
header file.
.\"
.\"
.SH "ADDRESS FORMAT"
.PP
For convenience and traditionally, the transport interface address used by XTI
for protocols in the TCP/IP protocol family use
.IR BSD -style
socket addresses (also described in XNS 5.2
.[[
xns99
.]])
for addresses.
.PP
The socket address, defined in
.RB < sys/socket.h >,
is structured as follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct sockaddr {
    uint16_t sa_family;
    char sa_data[14];
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The Internet Protocol family socket address, defined in
.RB < netinet/in.h >,
is structured as follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef unsigned int in_addr_t;

struct in_addr {
    in_addr_t  s_addr;
};

struct sockaddr_in {
    sa_family_t         sin_family;  /* Address family */
    unsigned short int  sin_port;    /* Port number */
    struct in_addr      sin_addr;    /* Internet address */
    /* padding */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
.B sockaddr_in
structure contains the following members:
.TP \w'sin_family\(em'u
.I sin_family
The address family.  Always set to
.BR AF_INET " or " AF_UNSPEC .
.PD 0
.TP
.I sin_port
The port number of the transport endpoint.
.TP
.I sin_addr
The IP address of the transport endpoint.
.TP
.I (padding)
Padding to pad the size of the
.B sockaddr_in
structure to the size of a
.B sockaddr
structure.
.PD
.PP
The structure is padded to the size of a
.BR sockaddr
structure (16 bytes).
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options are formatted according to the
.B t_opthdr
structure as described in
.BR xti (3).
An UDP transport provider compliant to this specification supports none, all
or any subset of the options defined here.  An implementation may restrict the
use of any of these options by offering them only in a priviledged read-only
mode.
.PP
Options can be
.I absolute requirements
and can also be of
.IR "end-to-end significance" ,
as follows:
.TP
.I Absolute Requirements
Options that are
.IR "absolute requirements" ,
mean the when the option is negotiated with the transport service provider,
the transport service provider is not permitted to negotiate the option to a
value with differing quality of service.  Either the proposed value is
accepted or it is rejected.  Options that are not
.IR "absolute requirements" ,
can be negotiated by the transport provider to a different quality of service
level and it is the responsibility of the transport service user to determine
whether the negotitated value is sufficient.
.TP
.I End-to-End Significance
Options that are of
.IR "end-to-end significance"
are options that require negotiation with, or are communicated to, the peer
transport provider or user.  For example, options that are requested in a
connection request,
.BR T_CONN_REQ (7),
primitive will be indicated at the peer in a connection indication,
.BR T_CONN_IND (7),
primitive.
Options that are not of
.IR "end-to-end significance"
are of local significance only and can be negotiated directly between the
local transport service user and the local transport service provider.
.PP
An UDP transport provider supports three levels of options.  These three levels
are described below.
.\"
.\"
.SS "XTI_GENERIC"
.PP
Options with this level are specific to the X/Open Transport Interface (XTI/TLI)
.[
xti revision 1.0
.]
and are common to all transport providers.  For more information see
.BR xti (3).
.PP
The options defined with the option level
.B XTI_GENERIC
are as follows:
.TP
.B XTI_DEBUG
Sets debugging flags for the stream.
This option is formatted as an array of
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are implementation defined.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.TP
.B XTI_LINGER
Sets whether, and the amount of time if, the stream will linger waiting for
unsent data to be delivered.
This option is formatted as a
.B t_linger
structure as follows:
.RS
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_linger {
    t_scalar_t l_onoff;   /* option on/off */
    t_scalar_t l_linger;  /* linger time */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'l_linger\(em'u
.I l_onoff
Specifies whether to linger
.RB ( T_YES )
or not
.RB ( T_NO ).
Legal values are
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
.TP
.I l_linger
Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to linger.
Legal values are
.BR T_INFINITE ", " T_UNSPEC
and all positive numbers including zero.
.PP
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.RE
.TP
.B XTI_RCVBUF
Specifies the size, in bytes, of the receive buffer.
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.TP
.B XTI_RCVLOWAT
Specifies the low water mark above which received data will be indicated and
delivered to the user.
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.TP
.B XTI_SNDBUF
Specifies the size, in bytes, of the transmit buffer.
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.TP
.B XTI_SNDLOWAT
Specifies the low water mark above which queued data will be transmitted to
the peer.
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.\"
.\"
.SS "T_INET_IP"
.PP
Options within this level are specific to the Internet Protocol (IP) and are
common to all the protocol levels in the TCP/IP suite.
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.PP
The options defined with the option level
.B T_INET_IP
are as follows:
.TP
.B T_IP_OPTIONS
Provides control for the T_IP OPTIONS field.  Used for debugging.
This option is formatted as an array of
.BR "unsigned char" ,
up to 40 elements.
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_TOS
Provides control of the type-of-service byte present in each transmited T_IP
packet.
This option is formated as an
.BR "unsigned char" .
Legal values can be generated with the
.BR SET_TOS ()
macro described in
.BR xti_ip (3).
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_TTL
Provides control of the time-to-live byte present in each transmitted T_IP
packet.
This option is formatted as an
.BR "unsigned char" .
Legal values are from 0 to 255.
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_REUSEADDR
Allows multiple non-listening binds to the same address.
This option is format as a
.BR "unsigned int" .
Legal values are
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_DONTROUTE
Bypasses routing tables and routes directly to an interface.  Used for
debugging.
This option is format as a
.BR "unsigned int" .
Legal values are
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_BROADCAST
Allows broadcast addresses to be used.  This option is not applicable to TCP
and is always set to
.BR T_NO .
This option is format as a
.BR "unsigned int" .
Legal values are
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.\"
.\"
.SS "T_INET_UDP"
.PP
Options within this level are specific to the User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) yet are used by protocol levels using UDP transport.
.PP
The options defined with the option level
.B T_INET_UDP
are as follows:
.TP
.B T_UDP_CHECKSUM
This option allows disabling/enabling of the
.B T_UDP
checksum computation.  The legal values are
.B T_YES
(checksum enabled) and
.B T_NO
(checksum disabled).
.sp
If this option is returned with
.BR t_rcvudata (3),
its value indicates whether a checksum was present in the received datagram or
not.
.sp
Numerous cases of undetected errors have been reported when applications
choose to turn of checksums for efficiency.  The advisability of ever turning
off the checksum algorithm is very controversial.
.sp
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
It can take on values
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
This option is an
.IR "absolute requirement" .
This option is of
.IR "end-to-end significance" .

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR XTI-UDP
has no known bugs.
The
.BR INET (4)
implementation of
.B XTI-UDP
has been conformance tested and validated using the
.BR test-inet_udp (8)
test case executable and the
.B @PACKAGE@ autotest
conformance and validation test suite.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
In support of the
.BR sockets (3)
library for
.BR tpi (7)
transport providers, the options described here have been made compatible with
the socket options described in
.BR udp (7).
As a result, depending on the release of 
.BR INET (4),
the XTI/TLI options described might not be compatible with the options described
here.
.PP
The
.B Linux
socket version of UDP described in
.BR udp (7),
accessed using the TPI interface of the
.B @PACKAGE@
package described in
.BR INET (4),
supports all of the options described here.
.PP
Earlier version of the
.BR INET (4)
driver did not support wildcard binds.  If an attempt was made to bind to a
wildcard address or port number, the bind would fail with
.RB [ TNOADDR ].
While this is correct behavior, it was not consistent with other
.B XTI-UDP
implemetnations.  Recent versions of the
.BR INET (4)
driver include the ability to bind to wildcards or to request that the
transport service provider asign a suitable address.
.PP
