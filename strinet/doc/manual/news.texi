@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.4
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.4
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.4

This @cite{OpenSS7 Project} release is another separate add-on package release
of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package that was formerly present in the
(now deprecated) @cite{LiS} package.  The networking drivers are provided, as
well as the TPI and XTI header files for INET and loop back operation.  The
package contains all the necessary manual packages and other documentation for
INET components in a separate autoconf tarball.  This release is a stable,
production grade release for @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and is part of the
OpenSS7 Master Package (@file{openss7-0.9.2.D}).

This release is both a maintenance release and a feature release.  The major new
feature added is a fully @dfn{STREAMS} based implementation of the
@manpage{rawip(4)} and @manpage{udp(4)} drivers.  This release is a stable
production release for @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.  Support for @cite{LiS} is
deprecated as of this release.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

@itemize -
@item
Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode
diet patch set).

@item
Fixed buffer leak in @samp{ss_sock_sendmsg} reported by John Wenker.
Significant rewrite of the ss_sock_sendmsg function.  Loader optimizations for
streams-inet driver.

@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.  The @samp{make installcheck} target will now automatically
test both 64-bit native and 32-bit compatibility versions, one after the other,
on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Many documentation updates for all @uref{http://www.openss7.org/,, OpenSS7}
packages.  Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
timely text documentation present in the release directory.

@item
Dropped support for @cite{LiS}.

@item
Updated @command{init} scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.

@item
Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number
230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package
will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6 kernels under
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} only.  @cite{@value{PACKAGE}} now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per
major device number on 2.6 kernels: @cite{LiS} cannot support this change.

@item
Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions:
support for additional @cite{SuSE} distributions on @code{ix86} as well as
@code{x86_64}.  Added distribution support includes @cite{SLES 9}, @cite{SLES 9
SP2}, @cite{SLES 9 SP3}, @cite{SLES 10}, @cite{SuSE 10.1}.

@item
Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent @command{gcc}
compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily
SUSE).

@item
Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition
to kernel programs.  Added new @option{--with-optimize} option to
@command{configure} to accomplish this.

@item
Added @command{--disable-devel} @command{configure} option to suppress building
and installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure
runtime targets that do not need the development environment (static libraries,
manual pages, documentation).

@item
Added @command{send-pr} script for automatic problem report generation.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux distributions
(EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

This is primarily a maintenance release.  Validated for operation on x86_64
SMP kernel using Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Changes included to handle __LP64__
kernels.  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
mailing list.  Corrects several bugs reported by project sponsors.

@itemize -
@item
Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support 32-bit
ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary compatibility should
not have been disrupted.  At the same time as the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT
ioctl support for most of the IO controls for the ldl(4) driver has been
added.

@item
Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

@item
Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on x86_64
architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler
warnings.

@item
Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on mailing
list.

@item
Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on N-way Xeons
even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

@item
Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibility over 64-bit on x86_64.
Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.
@end itemize

This is a public gamma release of the package.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2

This is primarily a bug fixes release.  This release has been verified
(conformance test suite passes) for operation with Linux Fast-STREAMS
(streams-0.7a.4).  Some test cases were updated because LiS was not operating
correctly on pipes (does not send SIGPIPE on write error contrary to POSIX).

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream version
only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All @cite{RPM}
release numbers will be @samp{-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)} and all @cite{Debian}
release numbers will be @samp{_0}.  If you wish to apply patches and release
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable release
suffix for your organization.  We leave @cite{Debian} release number @samp{_1}
reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the @file{.dsc}
file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels and
popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider distribution
support.  The package also supports both @file{LiS-2.18.1} as well as
@file{streams-0.7a} on both kernels.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the @command{@value{PACKAGE}} release.

This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.
