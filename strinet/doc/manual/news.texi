@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}

This release is a maintenance release.  It provides the following enhancements and fixes:

@itemize
@item
Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel
modules and drivers.
The @samp{make installcheck} target will now automagically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

@item
Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
documentation present in the release directory.

@item
Dropped support for @cite{LiS}.

@item
Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6 kernels under
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} only.

@item
This release candidate provides support for additional SuSE distributions on
ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

@item
Added @samp{--enable-devel} @command{configure} option for embedded targets.

@item
Added @command{send-pr} script for automatic problem report generation.

@item
Fixed buffer lead in @samp{ss_sock_sendmsg} reported by John Wenker.

@item
Significant rewrite of the ss_sock_sendmsg function.

@item
Loader optimizations for streams-inet driver.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.3

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux distributions
(EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

This is primarily a maintenance release.  Validated for operation on x86_64
SMP kernel using Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Changes included to handle __LP64__
kernels.  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
mailing list.  Corrects several bugs reported by project sponsors.

@itemize
@item
Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support 32-bit
ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary compatibilty should
not have been disrupted.  At the same time as the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT
ioctl support for most of the IO controls for the ldl(4) driver has been
added.

@item
Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

@item
Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on x86_64
architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler
warnings.

@item
Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on mailing
list.

@item
Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on N-way Xeons
even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

@item
Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibilty over 64-bit on x86_64.
Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.
@end itemize

This is a public gamma release of the package.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.2

This is primarily a bug fixes release.  This release has been verified
(conformance test suite passes) for operation with Linux Fast-STREAMS
(streams-0.7a.4).  Some test cases were updated because LiS was not operating
correctly on pipes (does not send SIGPIPE on write error contrary to POSIX).

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@unnumberedsubsec Major changes for release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.1

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream version
only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All @cite{RPM}
release numbers will be @samp{-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)} and all @cite{Debian}
release numbers will be @samp{_0}.  If you wish to apply patches and relelease
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable release
suffix for your organization.  We leave @cite{Debian} release number @samp{_1}
reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the @file{.dsc}
file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels and
popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider distribution
support.  The package also supports both @file{LiS-2.18.1} as well as
@file{streams-0.7a} on both kernels.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1
@unnumberedsubsec Initial release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the @command{@value{PACKAGE}} release.

This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.
