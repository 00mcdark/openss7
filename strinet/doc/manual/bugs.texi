RPMs built on 2.4 kernels have using the @samp{%dev} construct for RPM instead of installing devices
using the init scripts.  RPM complains loudly because the dev package defines some of the same iBCS
devices (e.g. @file{/dev/ipip}) as we are attempting to install.  In the meantime, use --force.

Fixed in @file{strinet.spec} to never build devices ala rpm for strinet package.

@item 001.
Several test cases are failing sending messages.  ICMP port unreachable errors are resulting.  It
appears that the caching of destination addresses is somehow making the receiver think that it is a
connection-oriented stream!
