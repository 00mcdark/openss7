This OpenSS7 Project release is another separate add-on package release of the OpenSS7 INET
Networking package that was formerly present in the (now deprecated) LiS package.  The networking
drivers are provided, as well as the TPI and XTI header files for INET and loopback operation.  The
package contains all the necessary manual pakges and other documentation for INET components in a
spearate autoconf tarball.  This release is a stable, production grade release for Linux
Fast-STREAMS and is part of the OpenSS7 Master Package (openss7-0.9.2.D).
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
This release is both a maintenance release and a feature release.  The major new feature added is a
fully STREAMS based implementation of the rawip(4) and udp(4) drivers.  This release is a stable
production release for Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Support for LiS is deprecated as of this release.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:
</p><ul style="margin-bottom:0in">
<li>Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patchset).</li>
<li>Fixed buffer leak in ss_sock_sendmsg reported by John Wenker.  Significant rewrite of the
ss_sock_sendmsg function.  Loader optimizations for streams-inet driver.</li>
<li>Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against 64-bit kernel modules and
drivers.  The `make installcheck' target will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated release file generation making
for vastly improved and timely text documentation present in the release directory.</li>
<li>Dropped support for LiS.</li>
<li>Updated init scripts for proper addition and removal of modules.</li>
<li>Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major device number 230.  Assign
major device number 230 explicitly to the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.  strinet now supports expanded
addressable minor device numbers, permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
on 2.6 kernels: LiS cannot support this change.</li>
<li>Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES distributions: support for
additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES
9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.</li>
<li>Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent gcc compilers and some
idiosyncratic behaviour for some distributions (primarily SUSE).</li>
<li>Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs in addition to kernel
programs.  Added new --with-optimize option to configure to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Added --disable-devel configure option to suppress building and installing development
environment.  This feature is for embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).</li>
<li>Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.</li>

<em>This is a public production release of the package: it deprecates previous releases.  Please
    upgrade before reporting problems with previous releases.</em>

OpenSS7 today announced Release 0.9.2.4 of the STREAMS INET for Linux NET4 <em>strinet</em> package.
</%method><%method news>
<& SELF:abstract &>
The OpenSS7 INET Networking package is an implementation of the Internet Protocol suite for Linux
Fast-STREAMS directly over Linux NET4 Sockets implementation, using a STREAMS over Sockets approach.
This permits modules to be pushed on UDP or TCP Streams and allows use of the XTI/TLI library with
Internet Protocols on Linux.  The package now also includes direct STREAMS implementations of RAW IP
and UDP, and will include direct implementations of TI loopback devices and TCP in the future.
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
<& SELF:description &>
</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in">
As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles, installs and builds rpms for a
wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6 RPM-based distributions,
and can be used on production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.
