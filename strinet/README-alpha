OpenSS7 INET Networking
=======================

Package strinet-0.9.2.4.rc3 Released 2006-09-09.

This is gamma release software.

The following is an extract from the Installation and Reference Manual:

5.5 Bugs
========

5.5.1 Defect Notices
--------------------

"OpenSS7 INET Networking" could possibly contain unknown defects.  This
is a "gamma" release.  Some remaining unknown defects could possibly be
harmful.  Validation testing has been performed by the `OpenSS7
Project' on this software for a set of systems and external validation
testing has been performed on other systems.  Nevertheless, the
software might still fail to configure or compile on other systems.
The `OpenSS7 Project' recommends that you validate this software for
your target system with care before using this software.  Use at your
own risk.  Remember that there is NO WARRANTY.(1)

This software is gamma software.  As such, it is quite stable but might
still crash your kernel under some conditions.  Installation of the
software on a non-validated distribution might mangle your header files
or Linux distribution in such a way as to make it unusable.  Crashes
could possibly lock your system and rebooting the system might not
repair the problem.  You can possibly loose all the data on your
system.  Because this software stands a chance of crashing your kernel,
the resulting unstable system could possibly destroy computer hardware
or peripherals making them unusable.  You might void the warranty on
any system on which you run this software.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) See section NO WARRANTY under `GNU General Public License', in the
manual.

5.5.2 Known Defects
-------------------

With the exception of packages not originaly created by the `OpenSS7
Project', the `OpenSS7 Project' software does not ship with known bugs
in any release stage except "pre-alpha".  "OpenSS7 INET Networking" had
no known bugs at the time of release.

5.5.3 Defect History
--------------------

This section contains historical bugs that were encountered during
development and their resolutions.  This list serves two purposes:

  1. It captures bugs encountered between releases during development
     that could possibly reoccur (and the Moon is made of blue cheese).
     It therefore provides a place for users to look if they encounter
     a problem.

  2. It provides a low overhead bug list between releases for
     developers to use as a `TODO' list.

 Bugs
.....

`001.'
     Several test cases are failing sending messages.  ICMP port
     unreachable errors are resulting.  It appears that the caching of
     destination addresses is somehow making the receiver think that it
     is a connection-oriented stream!

5.4.4 Gamma Releases
--------------------

"Gamma" release are releases that have received exhaustive testing
within the project, but external testing has been minimal.  "Gamma"
release packages do not ship with known defects.  As exhaustive
internal testing has been performed, unknown defects should be few.
Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

"Gamma" release packages typically resolve problems in previous "beta"
releases, and might not have had full regression testing performed.
Suitability of software in this category for production use is at the
discretion of the user of the software.   "The OpenSS7 Project"
recommends that the complete validation test suites provided with the
package be performed and pass on target systems before considering
production use.
