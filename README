 OpenSS7 Master Package
=======================

Package openss7-0.9.2.G was released under GPLv2 2007-11-05.

This is the `OpenSS7 Master Package' package.  It consists of a master
package that contains all other OpenSS7 Project package releases.  Use
this package if you are interested in ease of installation of a wide
range of OpenSS7 Project packages.

The `OpenSS7 Master Package' package contains:

`sctp-0.2.27' (`Linux Native Sockets SCTP'),
`iperf-2.0.8' (`Internet Performance'),
`streams-0.9.2.4' (`Linux Fast-STREAMS'),
`strcompat-0.9.2.7' (`STREAMS Compatibility Modules'),
`strutil-0.9.2.7' (`STREAMS Utilities'),
`strbcm-0.9.2.5' (`STREAMS Binary Compatibility Module'),
`strtty-0.9.2.4' (`STREAMS Terminals'),
`strxns-0.9.2.7' (`STREAMS X/Open Networking Services'),
`strxnet-0.9.2.12' (`STREAMS X/Open Networking'),
`strsock-0.9.2.4' (`STREAMS Sockets'),
`strinet-0.9.2.7' (`STREAMS Internet'),
`strsctp-0.9.2.9' (`STREAMS SCTP'),
`striso-0.9.2.4' (`STREAMS Open Systems Interconnect'),
`netperf-2.3.7' (`Network Performance'),
`strchan-0.9.2.4' (`STREAMS Channels'),
`strisdn-0.9.2.4' (`STREAMS ISDN Stack'),
`strss7-0.9a.8' (`STREAMS SS7 Stacks'),
`sigtran-0.9.2.4' (`STREAMS SIGTRAN Stack'),
`strvoip-0.9.2.4' (`STREAMS VoIP Stacks'),
`osr61-0.9.2.3' (`Dialogic Open System Release 6.1') and
`LiS-2.18.7' (`Linux STREAMS').

If you need to build an install a significant number of these packages,
the `OpenSS7 Master Package' package is the easiest way to do so.

This distribution is only currently applicable to `Linux' 2.4 and 2.6
kernels and was targeted at `ix86', `x86_64', `ppc' and `ppc64'
architectures, but should build and install for other architectures as
well.

`LICENSES'.  Please respect these licensing arrangements.  If you are
interested in different licensing terms, please contact the copyright
holder, or OpenSS7 Corporation <sales@openss7.com>.

See `README-alpha' (if it exists) for alpha release information.

 Prerequisites
--------------

The quickest and easiest way to ensure that all prerequisites are met
is to download and install the `OpenSS7 Master Package',
`openss7-0.9.2.G'.

Prerequisites for the OpenSS7 Master Package package are as follows:

  1. `Linux' distribution, somewhat `Linux Standards Base' compliant,
     with a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel and the appropriate tool chain for
     compiling out-of-tree kernel modules.  Most recent `Linux'
     distributions are usable out of the box, but some development
     packages must be installed.  For more information, see
     `Compatibility', in the manual.

         - A fairly LSB compliant GNU/Linux distribution.(1)
         - Linux 2.4 kernel (2.4.10 - 2.4.27), or
         - Linux 2.6 kernel (2.6.3 - 2.6.22);
         - glibc2 or better.
         - GNU groff (for man pages).(2)
         - GNU texinfo (for info files).
         - GNU bison and flex (for config programs).
         - net-snmp (for SNMP agents).(3)

When configuring and building multiple `OpenSS7 Project' release
packages, place all of the source packages (unpacked tarballs) at the
same directory level and all build directories at the same directory
level (e.g. all source packages under `/usr/src').

When installing packages that install as kernel modules, it is
necessary to have the correct kernel development package installed.
For the following distributions, use the following commands:

     Ubuntu:  $> apt-get install linux-headers
     Debian:  $> apt-get install kernel-headers
     Fedora:  $> yum install kernel-devel

You also need the same version of `gcc(1)' compiler with which the
kernel was built.  If it is not the default, add `CC=kgcc' on the line
after `./configure', for example:

     $> ../openss7-0.9.2.G/configure CC='gcc-3.4'

 Installation
-------------

The following commands will download, configure, build, check, install,
validate, uninstall and remove the package:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/openss7-0.9.2.G.tar.bz2
     $> tar -xjvf openss7-0.9.2.G.tar.bz2
     $> mkdir build
     $> pushd build
     $> ../openss7-0.9.2.G/configure --enable-autotest
     $> make
     $> make check
     $> sudo make install
     $> sudo make installcheck
     $> sudo make uninstall
     $> popd
     $> sudo rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf openss7-0.9.2.G
     $> rm -f openss7-0.9.2.G.tar.bz2

If you have problems, try building with the logging targets instead.
If the make of a logging target fails, an automatic problem report will
be generated that can be mailed to The OpenSS7 Project
<bugs@openss7.org>.(4) Installation steps using the logging targets
proceed as follows:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/openss7-0.9.2.G.tar.bz2
     $> tar -xjvf openss7-0.9.2.G.tar.bz2
     $> mkdir build
     $> pushd build
     $> ../openss7-0.9.2.G/configure --enable-autotest
     $> make compile.log
     $> make check.log
     $> sudo make install.log
     $> sudo make installcheck.log
     $> sudo make uninstall.log
     $> popd
     $> sudo rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf openss7-0.9.2.G
     $> rm -f openss7-0.9.2.G.tar.bz2

See `README-make' for additional specialized make targets.

For custom applications, see the `INSTALL' and `INSTALL-openss7' files
or the see `Installation', in the manual, as listed below.  If you
encounter troubles, see `Troubleshooting', in the manual, before
issuing a bug report.

 Brief Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

The OpenSS7 Master Package package is available from the downloads area
of The OpenSS7 Project website (http://www.openss7.org/download.html)
using a command such as:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/openss7-0.9.2.G.tar.bz2

Unpack the tarball using a command such as:

     $> tar -xjvf openss7-0.9.2.G.tar.bz2

The tarball will unpack into the relative subdirectory named after the
package name: openss7-0.9.2.G.

The package builds using the GNU `autoconf' utilities and the
`configure' script.  To build the package, we recommend using a
separate `build' directory as follows:

     $> mkdir build
     $> cd build
     $> ../openss7-0.9.2.G/configure

In general, the package configures and builds without adding any
special options to the `configure' script.  For general options to the
`configure' script, see the GNU `INSTALL' file in the distribution:

     $> less ../openss7-0.9.2.G/INSTALL

For specific options to the `configure' script, see the
`INSTALL-openss7' file in the distribution, or simply execute the
configure script with the `--help' option like so:

     $> ../openss7-0.9.2.G/configure --help

After configuring the package, the package can be compiled simply by
issuing the `make' command:

     $> make

Some specialized makefile targets exists, see the `README-make' file in
the distribution or simply invoke the `help' target like so:

     $> make help | less

After successfully building the package, the package can be checked by
invoking the `check' make target like so:

     $> make check

After successfully checking the package, the package can be installed
by invoking the `install' make target (as root) like so:

     $> sudo make install

The test suites that ship with the package can be invoked after the
package has been installed by invoking the `installcheck' target.  This
target can either be invoked as root, or as a normal user, like so:

     $> make installcheck

(Note: you must add the `--enable-autotest' flag to `configure', above
for the test suites to be invoked with `make installcheck'.)

The package can be cleanly removed by invoking the `uninstall' target
(as root):

     $> sudo make uninstall

Then the build directory and tarball can be simply removed:

     $> cd ..
     $> rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf openss7-0.9.2.G
     $> rm -f openss7-0.9.2.G.tar.bz2

 Detailed Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the
`Installation', in the manual, contained in the distribution in `text',
`info', `html' and `pdf' formats:

     $> cd ../openss7-0.9.2.G
     $> less doc/manual/openss7.txt
     $> lynx doc/manual/openss7.html
     $> info doc/manual/openss7.info
     $> xpdf doc/manual/openss7.pdf

The `text' version of the manual is always available in the `MANUAL'
file in the release.

The current manual is also always available online from `The OpenSS7
Project' website at:

     $> lynx http://www.openss7.org/openss7_manual.html

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) See `GNU/Linux Distributions', in the manual, for more information.
