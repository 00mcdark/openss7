\chapter	{The Directory User Interface}
The {\em DIrectory SHell},
\man dish(1c),
is the raw interface to the OSI Directory.
Unless you intend to be a really sophisticated user of the white pages service,
you should never need to use the \pgm{dish} program directly.

Chapter~4 of \volfive/ describes \pgm{dish} in considerable detail.
As such no further information is provided in \thebook/.
