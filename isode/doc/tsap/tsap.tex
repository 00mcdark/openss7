\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE PROBLEM}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	IMMEDIATE VACUUM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF
	APPLICATION PROTOCOLS
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT APPLICATION
		PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT TAKES AT LEAST AS MUCH TIME AS
		DEVELOPMENT OF LOWER-LEVEL PROTOCOLS
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE PROBLEM (CONT.)}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	LACK OF NEAR-TERM AVAILABILITY OF MAP/TOP ON ALL %
	MACHINES
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	NORTHROP HAS A STRONG COMMITTMENT
		TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CUSTOMER (DoD) ELECTRONICALLY
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE CAUSE}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	MAP/TOP, WHILE AGRESSIVE, IS STILL YOUNG
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	FANTASTIC PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TO DATE,
		BUT REALISTICALLY, A LOT MORE WORK IS REQUIRED
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE CAUSE (CONT.)}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	NORTHROP HAS REQUIREMENTS NOW
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	FACTORY- AND DIVISION-WIDE NETWORKING
		REQUIRED IN THE 88--89 TIMEFRAME
    \item	SINCE MAP/TOP SOLUTIONS AREN'T AVAILABLE ON EXISTING
		FACILITIES,
		INTERIM SOLUTIONS MUST BE PUT INTO PLACE QUICKLY
    \item	SOLUTIONS MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH THE
		DIRECTION OF THE MAP/TOP COMMUNITY
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{OBSERVATIONS}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SOLVED, IN DIFFERENT
	SETTINGS, WITHOUT LOSS OF GENERALITY
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	SOME OF THESE SOLUTIONS ARE QUITE MATURE (STABLE, ROBUST,
		AND ENJOY A HIGH DEGREE OF VENDOR SUPPORT)
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{OBSERVATIONS (CONT.)}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	MAP/TOP, BASED ON THE OSI MODEL, IS A STRONGLY LAYERED ARCHITECTURE,
	WHICH FACILITATES
	APPLICATION-INDEPENDENCE OF UNDERLYING PROTOCOLS
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	SERVICES ARE IMPORTANT,\\ IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE NOT
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{TCP/IP AS THE INTERIM SOLUTION}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	MILSTD PROTOCOL SUITE MANDATED FOR ALL DoD NETWORKING
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	MATURE SET OF PROTOCOLS SINCE 1980\\ (DATING FROM c.1970)
    \item	EMPHASIS ON RELIABILITY AND SECURITY
    \item	WIDE VENDOR SUPPORT AND USER POPULATION
    \item	VENDOR SUPPORT TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES (e.g., SNA)
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{TCP/IP (CONT.)}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	TCP/IP PROVIDES ROBUST TRANSPORT SERVICES
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	FUNCTIONALITY EQUIVALENT TO TP4\\ (AS PER NRC REPORT)
    \item	MANY VENDORS OFFER BOARD-LEVEL IMPLEMENTATIONS AT THE
		TRANSPORT LAYER
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{CONSTRUCTING THE SOLUTION}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	BEST OF ALL SOLUTIONS REQUIRE COMPLEMENTARY CO-EXISTANCE:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	UTILIZE TCP/IP FUNCTIONALITY NOT CURRENTLY PRESENT IN MAP
    \item	UTILIZE MAP/TOP FUNCTIONALITY AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE
    \item	DEVELOP APPLICATIONS IN AN EVOLUTIONARY,
		NOT REVOLUTIONARY FASHION
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{WHERE TO JOIN THEM?}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	NETWORK LAYER (OR BELOW):\\
	RE-INVENTS TCP\\ PREVENTS USE OF BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS
\item	SESSION LAYER (OR ABOVE):\\
	TOO MUCH DEPENDENCY ON TCP AND THE ARPANET CLIENT/SERVICE MODEL
\item	TRANSPORT SERVICE ACCESS POINT:\\
	TAKES ADVANTAGE OF TCP's STRENGTHS,\\
	WHILE GIVING MAP/TOP A FREE HAND ABOVE
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{WORK TO DATE}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	REQUEST FOR COMMENTS (RFC) 983:\\
	ISO TRANSPORT SERVICES ON TOP OF THE TCP
\item	PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION FOR 4.2BSD UNIX
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{ISO TSAP ON TOP OF THE TCP}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	SPECIFIES A FULL TP4 IMPLEMENTATION (ISO-8072)\\
	EXCEPT FOR QUALITY OF SERVICE PARAMETERS
\item	ADDRESSING IS TCP-BASED
\item	IMPLICIT MAXIMUM TSDU SIZE\\
	(TO BE RELAXED IN VERSION 2)
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE NEXT STEP}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC-DOMAIN SESSION, FTAM, AND CASE IMPLEMENTATIONS
	FOR TESTING PURPOSES
\item	IMPLEMENTATION OF RFC983 ON THE WIDE RANGE OF MACHINES CURRENTLY
	IN USE AT NORTHROP
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{MIGRATION STRATEGY}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	RFC983 NOT INTENDED AS A MIGRATION STRATEGY,
	BUT COULD FORM THE BACKBONE FOR AN OVERALL TRANSITION PLAN
\item	FUTURE VERSIONS OF RFC983 WILL TRACK DoD PLANNED EVOLUTION
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{MAXIMIZE BENEFITS}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	RFC983 PERMITS US TO UTILIZE THE NEW WORK
	BEING DONE BY THE MAP/TOP COMMUNITY,
	WHILE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YEARS OF RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCE IN THE
	TCP/IP COMMUNITY
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}
