\part	{BUILDING AN OSI APPLICATION}\bf

\begin{nrtc}
\item	YOU ARE NOW FAMILIAR WITH:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	A MODEL FOR DISTRIBUTED OSI APPLICATIONS

    \item	OSI SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE APPLICATION
    \end{nrtc}

\item	WE NOW DESCRIBE A ``DISCIPLINE'' TO BRING THE PIECES TOGETHER
\item	OUR SCENARIO WILL BUILD AN APPLICATION BASED ON REMOTE OPERATIONS

\ctitle	{INITIATORS}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	IN GENERAL, THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF INITIATOR IMPLEMENTATIONS

\item	INTERACTIVE
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	A USER RUNS A PROGRAM AND INTERACTIVELY DIRECTS THE
		INVOCATION OF OPERATIONS
    \end{nrtc}

\item	EMBEDDED
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	A PROGRAM CAUSES AN ASSOCIATION TO BE AUTOMATICALLY FORMED
		AND OPERATIONS TO BE INVOKED
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{RESPONDERS}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	IN GENERAL, THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF RESPONDER IMPLEMENTATIONS,
	DEPENDING ON HOW ASSOCIATIONS ARE GIVEN TO THE PROGRAM WHICH
	IMPLEMENTS THE SERVICE

\item	SINGLE ASSOCIATION (a.k.a. THE DYNAMIC APPROACH)
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	EACH TIME THE SERVICE IS REQUESTED, A NEW INSTANCE OF
		THE PROGRAM IS EXECUTED
    \end{nrtc}

\item	MULTIPLE ASSOCIATION (a.k.a. THE STATIC APPROACH)
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	EACH TIME THE SERVICE IS REQUESTED, THE REQUEST IS GIVEN TO A
		SINGLE, ALREADY EXECUTING, INSTANCE OF THE PROGRAM
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}

\ctitle	{GENERAL ORGANIZATION}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	AT COMPILE-TIME:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	USE RO-SPECIFICATION TO GENERATE SUPPORT FACILITIES
    \end{nrtc}

\item	AT RUN-TIME:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	USE DIRECTORY SERVICES TO LOCATE/REGISTER SERVICES

    \item	USE ASSOCIATION CONTROL TO BIND/UNBIND APPLICATIONS

    \item	USE REMOTE OPERATIONS TO INVOKE TRANSACTIONS
    \end{nrtc}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	WE ARE DESCRIBING \emph{ONE} POSSIBLE METHOD
	FOR REALIZING THE MODEL USING THE UNDERLYING FACILITIES

\item	MANY MORE ARE POSSIBLE

\item	THE APPROACH DESCRIBED IS THAT TAKEN BY THE \emph{ISODE},
	KNOWN TO SOME AS \emph{THE COOKBOOK}
