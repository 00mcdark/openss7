ISODE Internals

Marshall T. Rose
Principal Scientist
Performance Systems International, Inc.

Overview

     This two day course describes an implementation of the core aspects
     of OSI called The ISO Development Environment (ISODE).  The ISODE
     is interesting in four respects:

      - it provides extensive automatic tooling for the development of OSI
	applications;
      - it supports OSI applications on top of both OSI and TCP/IP-based
	networks;
      - it provides a novel approach to the problems of OSI coexistence
	and transition; and,
      - its source code is openly available (non-proprietary).

What You Will Learn

     Attendees will gain a thorough understanding of what the ISODE is
     and how to put the ISODE to good use.  In particular, emphasis is
     placed on putting the ISODE to work: bringing it up, running it,
     and modifying it for particular environments. 

Syllabus

  o History and Introduction -- why the ISODE project was undertaken,
    the design and implementation policy, underlying abstractions

  o Lower Layer Infrastructure -- the transport service, the transport-switch,
    adding a transport-stack, "typical" site configurations

  o Upper Layer Infrastructure -- application binding, presentation
    abstractions, defining a new service

  o Implementing new services -- a model for distributed applications,
    the RO-notation, static facilities, dynamic facilities

  o Network Management (SNMP) -- core routines, agent implementation,
    exporting MIB modules, prototyping NOC applications

  o Directory Services -- introduction to the Directory, introduction
    to QUIPU, the QUIPU DSA, a White Pages Service

  o Future Directions -- the ISODE consortium

Who Should Attend

     This course is targeted to applications programmers and system
     managers who need to better understand how to install, configure,
     and modify the ISODE.  Attendees must have a good understanding of
     the C programming language, user-level programming for UNIX, and
     the rudiments of OSI.  Please note that this is not an introductory
     course to any of these topics!

Instructor


     Marshall T. Rose is Principal Scientist at Performance Systems
     International, Inc., where he works on OSI protocols and network
     management.  He is the principal implementor of the ISO Development
     Environment (ISODE), an openly available implementation of the
     upper layers of the OSI protocol suite.  He is the author of both
     **The Open Book** and **The Simple Book**, professional texts
     providing a practical perspective on both OSI and network
     management of internets, both published by Prentice-Hall.  Rose
     received the Ph.D. degree in Information and Computer Science from
     the University of California, Irvine, in 1984.  His subscriptions
     to **The Atlantic** and **Rolling Stone Magazine** are in good standing.

The ISODE is the de facto reference implementation of the core aspects
of OSI.  By attending this course, you should gain a thorough
understanding of what the ISODE is and how to put the ISODE to good use:
bringing it up, running it, and modifying it for particular environments.

  o Topics: History and Introduction, Lower Layer Infrastructure,
    Upper Layer Infrastructure, Implementing new services,
    Network Management (SNMP), Directory Services, Future Directions

  o Attendees: applications programmers and system managers, with a good
    understanding of the C programming language, user-level programming
    for UNIX, and the rudiments of OSI.
