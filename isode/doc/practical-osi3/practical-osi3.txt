Practical Perspectives on OSI Networking

Marshall T. Rose
Principal Scientist
Performance Systems International, Inc.

Overview

     This two day course provides a practical perspective on the
     issues involved in developing and deploying OSI networks:
     it is concerned with "filling in the gaps" between "what the
     standards say" and "how a system implements OSI".  The talk does
     not focus on architecture, nor on vendor offerings or specific
     implementations, rather it deals with system issues such as
     explaining how much knowledge the transport layer must have, or why
     certain OSI protocol combinations do not interwork.

What You Will Learn

     Attendees will gain a thorough understanding of the technology involved
     in developing OSI applications, building OSI networks, and transiting to
     (or coexisting with) TCP/IP-based networks.

Syllabus

     o End-to-End Services -- concepts, building blocks, and comparison 
       with relevant TCP/IP technology.

     o Application Services -- application layer structure, application
       service elements

     o Directory Services -- information framework, distributed operations,
       integration into new services

     o Transition and Coexistence with TCP/IP -- motivation and background,
       protocol-based Approaches, service-based approaches, examples

Who Should Attend

     This tutorial is intended for professionals interested in planning,
     implementing, or managing OSI networks.  A basic familiarity with
     networking and OSI is assumed: this course is NOT an introduction
     to, or a tutorial on, OSI.  Detailed knowledge of the protocols is
     not required, but experience with implementing networking protocols
     is very helpful.  Experience with the "C" programming language is also
     useful.


Instructor

     Marshall T. Rose is Principal Scientist at Performance Systems
     International, Inc., where he works on OSI protocols and network
     management.  He is the principal implementor of the ISO Development
     Environment (ISODE), an openly available implementation of the
     upper layers of the OSI protocol suite.  He is the author of both
     **The Open Book** and **The Simple Book**, professional texts
     providing a practical perspective on both OSI and network
     management of internets, both published by Prentice-Hall.  Rose
     received the Ph.D. degree in Information and Computer Science from
     the University of California, Irvine, in 1984.  His subscriptions
     to **The Atlantic** and **Rolling Stone Magazine** are in good standing.
