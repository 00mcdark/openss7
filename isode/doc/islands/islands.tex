\ctitle	{THE CURRENT SITUATION}

\begin	{nrtc}
\item	LACK OF ADEQUATE COMMUNICATIONS HAS CREATED\\
	``ISLANDS OF AUTOMATION''
\item	EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN A HETEROGENEOUS
	ENVIRONMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE COMPUTER INTEGRATED
	MANUFACTURING A REALITY
\item 	PROPRIETARY SOLUTIONS ARE NOT THE ANSWER
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item	A TRULY HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES AN OPEN SYSTEM
	      	APPROACH TO COMMUNICATIONS
	\end	{nrtc}
\end	{nrtc}

\ctitle	{THE INDUSTRY SOLUTION}

\begin	{nrtc}
\item 	GENERAL MOTORS STARTED WORK ON THE MANUFACTURING
	AUTOMATION PROTOCOL (MAP) IN 1980	
\item	BOEING STARTED WORK ON THE
	TECHNICAL AND OFFICE PROTOCOL (TOP) IN 1985
\item	ISO BASED MAP/TOP PROTOCOLS ARE BECOMING AN ACCEPTED STANDARD
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item	BOEING, MACDONNELL DOUGLAS, LOCKHEED AND HUGHES ARE
		ADOPTING MAP/TOP
	\item	THE DEFENSE COMMUNICATIONS AGENCY AND
		THE AIR FORCE ARE ADOPTING MAP/TOP

\item	SESSION LAYER IS INCOMPLETE
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item	-- SYNCHRONIZATION SUBSET IS MISSING
	\item	-- ACTIVITY SUBSET (REQUIRED FOR ELECTRONIC MAIL) IS MISSING
	\end	{nrtc}
\item	PRESENTATION LAYER IS MISSING ALTOGETHER
	\begin	{nrtc}

\begin	{nrtc}

	\item	APPLICATION INTERFACE (CASE): PROTOTYPE FROM AUTOFACT
		DEMONSTRATION
	\item	NETWORK MANAGEMENT: SEVERAL INCOMPATIBLE VERSIONS
	\item	DIRECTORY SERVICES: SEVERAL INCOMPATIBLE VERSIONS

\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{OBSERVATIONS}

\begin	{nrtc}
\item	MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SOLVED, IN\\ DIFFERENT
	SETTINGS, WITHOUT LOSS OF GENERALITY
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item	SOME OF THESE SOLUTIONS ARE QUITE MATURE
		(STABLE, ROBUST, AND ENJOY A HIGH DEGREE OF VENDOR SUPPORT)
	\end	{nrtc}
\item	MAP/TOP IS A STRONGLY LAYERED ARCHITECTURE, WHICH FACILITATES
	APPLICATION-INDEPENDENCE OF UNDERLYING PROTOCOLS
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item	SERVICES ARE IMPORTANT,\\ IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE NOT
	\end	{nrtc}

\ctitle	{HOW WILL NORTHROP GET TO MAP/TOP?}

\begin	{nrtc}
\item	WAIT FOR THE VENDORS TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item	HOW MANY TIMES WILL SYSTEMS HAVE TO BE REWRITTEN?
	\item	HOW MANY INTERIM SOLUTIONS WILL THE VENDORS SELL US?
	\end	{nrtc}
\item	DEVELOP A MIGRATION STRATEGY
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item 	ENSURE THAT ANY WORK STARTED TODAY WILL EASILY MIGRATE TO
		TOTAL MAP/TOP SOLUTIONS, AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE
	\item	ALLOW FOR THE CO-EXISTENCE OF EXISTING SYSTEMS

\begin	{nrtc}
\item	MILSTD PROTOCOL SUITE MANDATED FOR ALL DoD NETWORKING
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item	MATURE SET OF PROTOCOLS SINCE 1980\\ (DATING FROM c.1970)
	\item	EMPHASIS ON RELIABILITY AND SECURITY
	\item	WIDE VENDOR SUPPORT AND USER POPULATION
	\item	VENDOR SUPPORT TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES (e.g., SNA)
	\end	{nrtc}
\item	TCP/IP PROVIDES ROBUST TRANSPORT SERVICE
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item 	FUNCTIONALITY EQUIVALENT TO MAP/TOP TP4\\ (AS PER NRC REPORT)
	\end	{nrtc}
\item	DoD IS COMMITTED TO MIGRATING FROM TCP/IP TO MAP/TOP
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item	NBS HAS ALREADY RECEIVED FUNDING TO DEVELOP APPLICATION
		GATEWAYS FOR FILE TRANSFER AND ELECTRONIC MAIL.

\begin	{nrtc}
\item	BEST OF ALL SOLUTIONS REQUIRE COMPLEMENTARY CO-EXISTENCE:
	\begin	{nrtc}
	\item	UTILIZE TCP/IP FUNCTIONALITY NOT CURRENTLY PRESENT IN MAP
	\item	UTILIZE MAP/TOP FUNCTIONALITY AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE
	\item	DEVELOP APPLICATIONS IN AN EVOLUTIONARY,\\

\begin	{nrtc}
\item	EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATIONS IS THE KEY TO COMPUTER INTEGRATED

\item	EVEN THOUGH MAP/TOP IS NOT COMPLETE, AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
	SYSTEM CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TODAY WHICH
	WILL EASILY MIGRATE TO THE EMERGING STANDARDS
\item	AS THE DEVELOPERS OF THE MIGRATION PLAN, NORTHROP IS IN A LEADERSHIP
	POSITION
\item	ALLOWS DoD RESEACHERS TO BECOME ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN\\ MAP/TOP
	DEVELOPMENT
