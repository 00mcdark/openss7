Dvi2ps is program the translates DVI files to PostScript (PostScript is a
trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc).  When the output of dvi2ps is preceded by
about 2 pages of PostScript code, TeX output can be printed on PostScript
devices (such as an Apple LaserWriter).

It uses the TeX-compatible set of 300 dpi fonts, and downloads the bitmap
description of each character, once, as it is needed, for every job (i.e., 
resident fonts  are not used).  While this sounds expensive, it is not too 
bad.  After the conversion to PostScript is done, and considering "normal 
documents" and 9600 baud communication, the first page can take a minute or 
so to transmit and print.  Thereafter, pages are usually printed faster.
Simple documents of 20 & 30 pages have printed at an overall average of
3.2 pages/minute (it is unlikely that you will ever get substantially 
higher than this with the program as it currently stands).  More typical
rates will be 2.5 pages/min.  Conversion time is extra, of course, but
does not seem to be excessive.

Dvi2ps currently runs on Apollo (AEGIS) and Vax 4.2BSD machines (and shortly
Macintosh XL with MacWorks).

There are many problems:

  1. It is not very clever about which fonts and characters to download on
     a per-job basis, except that each character is sent only once, just before
     it is needed.  All character and fonts are then made resident on the printer
     until the end of the job.  This consumes more memory on the printer (at least 
     on the Apple LaserWriter) than is necessary, and can limit the size of the
     job than can be printed.  "Simple" 50 page documents can be printed
     with room to spare (I suspect the limit is in the range of 70-100 pages for
     these, but we haven't tried any that large yet).  On the other hand,
     a section out of the LaTeX test files (manual) that uses 30 or more
     different fonts, some of them very large, was limited to 30 pages.
     Dvi2ps has -from and -to options to extract ranges of pages.

  2. The resulting PostScript files are very large (they can easily be 5 times
     the size of the DVI file).

  3. Character positioning is not calculated in the "official" dvitype manner,
     and so there *might* be *VERY* small anomolies.  However, care is taken,
     and the result is quite acceptable (at least to many untrained eyes).
     In fact, positioning is better than some other common processors, and
     no anomolies have as yet been noticed.

In summary, it was quite easy to develop and will serve us well until something
better comes along.
