The use of this program may not be readily apparent.  If you are using
TranScript, and your printer's name is "ps", you would use a command
sequence that looked something like this:

	% tex myfile
	% dvi2ps myfile > myfile.ps
	% lpr -Pps myfile.ps

The first few pages will print in a very very slow fashion while the fonts
are being defined.  Printing speeds up a little as you get further down the
document.


Installation comments:
======================

In installing this software, you will need to put tex.ps in
/usr/lib/tex/tex.ps.  If you want to put it somewhere else, see the
definition in the Makefile.  tex.ps is incorporated into the PostScript file
produced by dvi2ps. The file tex.ps.doc is tex.ps with all the
comments.

The font area is assumed to be /usr/lib/tex/fonts. 
This filter supports the TEXFONTS environment path.  The font area is
arranged in a new fashion that will probably be showing up in other device
drivers as well.  All the tfm files are contained in /usr/lib/tex/fonts.  If
a file named SUBDIR is present in /usr/lib/tex/fonts (or whatever directory
name you select), then the name of the font is taken as the name of a
subdirectory in searching for the gf file associated with the font.  In
other words, cmr10.300gf will be found in
/usr/lib/tex/fonts/cmr10/cmr10.300gf.  When the file named SUBDIR is not
present, all gf files are looked for in the directory itself, in other
words, /usr/lib/tex/fonts/cmr10.300gf in the above example.

printcap information
====================

MIT uses another program called dvipsf when the LaserWriter is used with the
/etc/printcap file.  dvipsf invokes dvi2ps and applef.  Both dvipsf.c and
applef.c are included here.  MIT's printcap entry for the laserwriter reads:
7th Floor LaserWriter|lw7|7lw|laserwriter|apple|LE-MONDE|LE-MONDE-LGP|LE-MONDE-ASCII|LE-MONDE-DVI:\
	:cP=LE-MONDE-LGP:cT:dP=LE-MONDE-DVI:dT:vP=LE-MONDE:\
	:br#9600:rw:fc#0000374:fs#0000003:xc#0:xs#0040040:mx#0:\
	:lp=/dev/ttyh5:sd=/usr/spool/lw7:pl#66:pw#89:\
	:lf=/usr/spool/lw7/log:of=/usr/lib/applef:\
	:md=/usr/spool/lw7/motd:vf=/usr/lib/applef:\
	:df=/usr/lib/dvipsf:cf=/usr/lib/applebitf:


History and acknowledgements
============================

The driver was converted by Neal Holtz of Carleton University from a Sun
previewer originally written by Mark Senn and later modified by others (see
dvi2ps for specifics).  Additional modifications and enhancements have been
done by Scott Jones and Chris Lindblad at MIT. tpic support and misc
bug fixes by Dorab Patel <dorab@cs.ucla.edu> with help from Dan
Trinkle <trinkle@purdue.edu>.
