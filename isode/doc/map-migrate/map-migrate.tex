\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE CURRENT SITUATION}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	IMMEDIATE VACUUM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF
	APPLICATION PROTOCOLS
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT APPLICATION
		PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT TAKES AT
		LEAST AS MUCH TIME AS DEVELOPMENT OF
 		LOWER-LEVEL PROTOCOLS
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE CURRENT SITUATION (CONT.)}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	LACK OF NEAR-TERM AVAILABILITY OF MAP/TOP ON ALL
	MACHINES
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	NORTHROP HAS A STRONG COMMITTMENT
		TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CUSTOMER (DoD) ELECTRONICALLY
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE PROBLEM}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	NORTHROP HAS REQUIREMENTS NOW
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	FACTORY- AND DIVISION-WIDE NETWORKING
		REQUIRED IN THE 88--89 TIMEFRAME
    \item	SINCE MAP/TOP SOLUTIONS AREN'T AVAILABLE ON EXISTING
		FACILITIES,
		INTERIM SOLUTIONS MUST BE PUT INTO PLACE QUICKLY
    \item	SOLUTIONS MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH THE
		DIRECTION OF THE MAP/TOP COMMUNITY
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{OBSERVATIONS}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SOLVED, IN DIFFERENT
	SETTINGS, WITHOUT LOSS OF GENERALITY
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	SOME OF THESE SOLUTIONS ARE QUITE MATURE (STABLE, ROBUST,
		AND ENJOY A HIGH DEGREE OF VENDOR SUPPORT)
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{OBSERVATIONS (CONT.)}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	MAP/TOP, BASED ON THE OSI MODEL, IS A STRONGLY
	LAYERED ARCHITECTURE, WHICH FACILITATES
	APPLICATION-INDEPENDENCE OF UNDERLYING PROTOCOLS
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	SERVICES ARE IMPORTANT,\\ IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE NOT
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle {THE SOLUTION}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	USE MILSTD TCP/IP AS THE MIGRATION VEHICLE
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	OFFER MAP/TOP SERVICES ON TOP OF THE
		TCP/IP PROTOCOL SUITE
    \item	DEVELOP MAP/TOP APPLICATIONS NOW
    \item	NO (OR MINIMAL) RECODING LATER
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}

\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle {TCP/IP CREDENTIALS}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	MILSTD PROTOCOL SUITE MANDATED FOR ALL DoD NETWORKING
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	MATURE SET OF PROTOCOLS SINCE 1980\\ (DATING FROM c.1970)
    \item	EMPHASIS ON RELIABILITY AND SECURITY
    \item	WIDE VENDOR SUPPORT AND USER POPULATION
    \item	VENDOR SUPPORT TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES (e.g., SNA)
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{MIGRATION PHILOSOPHY}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	COMPLEMENTARY CO-EXISTANCE:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	UTILIZE TCP/IP FUNCTIONALITY NOT CURRENTLY PRESENT IN MAP
    \item	UTILIZE MAP/TOP FUNCTIONALITY AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE
    \end{nrtc}
\item	DEVELOP APPLICATIONS IN AN EVOLUTIONARY,
	NOT REVOLUTIONARY FASHION
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle {A MIGRATION STRATEGY}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	THREE PHASES FROM TCP/IP TO MAP/TOP
	PROTOCOL SUITE
\item	REQUIRES ALL NEW HOSTS TO SPEAK TCP/IP UNTIL PHASE THREE
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle {PHASE ONE:\\ BUILD ISO DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	BEGIN WORK ON MAP/TOP APPLICATION PROTOCOLS
\item	NORTHROP DEVELOPED TSAP OFFERS TP4 SERVICE
\item	DEVELOP COMMON USER AGENTS
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	COMMON USER INTERFACE
    \item	ALLOWS USE OF EITHER TCP/IP OR MAP/TOP APPLICATION SERVICE
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle{PHASE TWO:\\ EXPERIMENT WITH MIGRATION ENGINES}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	START USING HOSTS WITH BOTH MAP/TOP AND TCP/IP PROTOCOL SUITES
\item	TEST APPLICATIONS IN A ``PURE'' MAP/TOP ENVIRONMENT
\item	USE LAYER 3 (INTERNET) LEVEL GATEWAYS TO FORM TWO LOGICAL INTERNETS
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle{PHASE THREE:\\ DEPLOY MIGRATION ENGINES}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	NEW HOSTS CAN BE MAP/TOP ONLY
\item	USER AGENTS BEGIN TO SPEAK MAP/TOP ONLY
\item	RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE (AT FIRST) TO KEEP SOME
	TCP/IP-ONLY HOSTS
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE FIRST STEP}

\item	AN OPENLY AVAILABLE ISO DEVELOPMENT
	ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED
	AT NORTHROP
