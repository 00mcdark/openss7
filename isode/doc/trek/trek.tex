\ctitle	{FUNDAMENTAL PREMISES}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	OSI/ISO WILL DOMINATE COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS

\item	EXISTING INVESTMENTS (IN NON-OSI TECHNOLOGY) SHOULD BE PROTECTED
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	BUT REALISTICALLY, EQUIPMENT HAS A HALF-LIFE OF 5 YEARS
    \end{nrtc}

\item	NEW INVESTMENTS SHOULD EITHER BE OSI OR HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF
	OSI-COMPATIBILITY
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{WHAT IS OSI/ISO?}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	A LAYERED ARCHITECTURE FOR COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS

\item	STANDARDIZED IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

\item	NON-PROPRIETARY IN NATURE
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}

\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE OSI APPLICATION LAYER}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	MANY STANDARD SERVICE ELEMENTS
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	ASSOCATION CONTROL

    \item	REMOTE OPERATIONS

    \item	RELIABLE TRANSFER

    \item	COMMITMENT, CONCURRENCY AND RECOVERY

    \item	ABSTRACT SYNTAX NOTATION ONE\\
		(REALLY PRESENTATION LAYER)

will use the terms ISO and OSI interchangeably from now on

ISO will provide the dominant communication protocol family in the 1990's
\end{note}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{POSSIBLE SOLUTION \#1\\ EXAGERATED, OBVIOUSLY}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	FIRE ALL NON-OSI PERSONNEL

\item	SELL ALL NON-OSI EQUIPMENT

\item	BANKROLL ONLY PURE-OSI INVESTMENTS
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{NOT A VERY GOOD IDEA\\ (NOT RECOMMENDED)}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	CAPABILITY OF {\bf CURRENT\/} OSI PRODUCTS
	NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER EXISTING NETWORKING PRODUCTS
    
\item	WE CAN'T SHUTDOWN THE FACTORY/OFFICE

\item	A REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH WHEN WE NEED EVOLUTION
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{note}\em
in fact, at one map/top meeting, it was noted that

\begin{quote}
``NORTHROP has shipped more OSI software than any OSI vendor''
\end{quote}

by one of the leading OSI vendors!
\end{note}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{POSSIBLE SOLUTION \#2\\ NOT SO EXAGERATED}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	START BUILDING A SEPARATE OSI ENVIRONMENT INDEPENDENT OF THE EXISTING
	ENVIRONMENT

\item	SWITCH WHEN OSI TECHNOLOGY REACHES SUPERIOR CAPABILITY

\item	EMPLOY HIGH-LEVEL GATEWAYS TO SHUTTLE INFORMATION BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTS
	(e.g., PROFS TO X.400)
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}

\diagram[p]{figure1}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{A BETTER IDEA, BUT NOT PERFECT}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	PERMITS US TO GAIN EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY

\item	HOPEFULLY DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH EXISTING OPERATIONS

\item	SOME DUPLICATION OF EFFORT
    
\item	HIGH-LEVEL GATEWAYS OFTEN DON'T WORK VERY WELL
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	``SOMETIMES WHEN YOU TRY TO TURN AN APPLE INTO AN ORANGE YOU
		GET BACK A LEMON''
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{POSSIBLE SOLUTION \#3}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	START BUILDING AN OSI ENVIRONMENT ON TOP OF EXISTING ENVIRONMENTS

\item	BUILD SELECTED NEW SYSTEMS WITH OSI

\item	MIGRATE EXISTING APPLICATIONS TO AN OSI FRAMEWORK AS THE TECHNOLOGY
	BECOMES AVAILABLE

\item	CONTINUE RUNNING SELECTED SYSTEMS ``AS IS''
\end{nrtc}

\ctitle	{THE GOOD NEWS}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	AN ORDERLY AND GRADUAL MIGRATION

\item	MAXIMIZES USE OF EXISTING RESOURCES

\item	PROOF OF CONCEPT: ISODE, DECnet/ISO

\item	FACILITATES BEST TOOL FOR THE JOB
\end{nrtc}

\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE BAD NEWS}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	 A ``NON-PURE'' SOLUTION (PURITY IS A RELIGION!)

\ctitle	{SUMMARY}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	THE GOOD: INTEGRATED (USE SERVICE EMULATORS)
