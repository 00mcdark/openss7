\ctitle	{THE OPEN SYSTEMS FILE SERVICE}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	NOT ``JUST'' FILE TRANSFER

\item	THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK FOR OSI
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	FILESTORE TO FILESTORE TRANSFER

    \item	WORKSTATION FILE RETRIEVAL

    \item	DISKLESS WORKSTATION PROTOCOL

    \item	SPECIAL APPLICATIONS (e.g., PRINTING, SPOOLING)

    \item	REMOTE DATABASE ACCESS
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{note}\em
as one of the OSI applications,
FTAM is exciting
as we get to see how all of the lower layer services are used

because of its scope,
FTAM is challenging
as it has a very large operating charter
(simple file transfer, database access, remote filesystems, and so on)

it is a largish undertaking:
the spec is about 350~pages,
the ISODE implementation (which isn't complete) is about 40K~lines of C code
(about 25\% machine-generated, thank goodness)
\end{note}


\begin{note}\em
an audience survey, who has:

heard of FTAM?

read the FTAM specification?

*understood* the FTAM specification?

heard of association control (sometimes incorrectly called CASE)?

heard of unix and the C programming language?
