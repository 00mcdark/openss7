\section	{Distribution Mechanics}\label{distribution}
The ISODE distribution is available in two forms:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Anonymous FTP\\
If you can FTP to the ARPA Internet,
use anonymous FTP to the ARPAnet host louie.udel.edu (10.0.0.96) and retrieve
the file portal/isode-1.tar.
This is a 2.0MB \man tar(1) image.
Alternately,
the file \verb"portal/isode-1.tar.Z" can be retrieved which contains a
\pgm{compress}'d version of the \pgm{tar} file,
and is about 0.8MB in size.

\item	Magnetic tape\\
Otherwise, send a magnetic tape with a self-addressed mailing label to:
\[\begin{tabular}{ll}
Postal address:&	Northrop Research and Technology Center\\
&			Attn: Automation Sciences Laboratory (0330/T30)\\
&			One Research Park\\
&			Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA  90274\\
&			USA\\[0.1in]
Telephone:&		+1--213/544--5393\\[0.1in]
Internet Mailbox:&	\tt Bug-ISODE@NRTC.NORTHROP.COM
\end{tabular}\]
The lab will send back the tape in \man tar(1) format at 1600bpi,
along with a copy of the {\em User's Manual}.
\end{itemize}
