\ctitle	{ARE THE ISO PROTOCOLS REAL?}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	THE ISO PROTOCOLS HAVE FOUND WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FROM
	VENDORS AND USER GROUPS

\item	BUT THERE ARE STILL DOUBTS AS TO THE VIABILITY OF THE ISO PROTOCOLS

\item	TECHNICAL ISSUES:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	WORKABILITY - CAN THEY BE IMPLEMENTED?
    \item	HARMONY - CAN DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATIONS WORK TOGETHER?
    \item	STABILITY - HOW OFTEN ARE THINGS GOING TO CHANGE?
    \item	INTEROPERABILITY - WHAT TO DO ABOUT EXISTING NETWORKED
		SYSTEMS?
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}

question: are the iso protocols real?

answer: a qualified yes!

\ctitle	{PERFORMANCE OBSERVATIONS}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	THE 5-P PRINCIPLE:\\
	PROPER PLANNING PREVENTS POOR PERFORMANCE

\item	INITIAL BENCHMARKING SUGGESTS THROUGHPUT RATES VERY CLOSE TO RAW TCP
	FOR BOTH TRANSPORT AND SESSION ECHO AND SINK ENTITIES

\item	AT THE APPLICATION INTERFACE (ABOVE ACSE/ROSE),
	PERFORMANCE IS ONLY 10\%-12\% WORSE THAN RAW TCP

\item	RESULTS PRIMARILY DUE TO MINIMIZED BYTE-COPYING BETWEEN
	LAYERS
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{EXPERIENCE SHOWS...}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	WORKABILITY - YES, THE PROTOCOLS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	ONLY ONE GLARING PROBLEM IN THE SPECIFICATIONS\\
		(BEING ADDRESSED IN THE STANDARDS COMMITTEE)
    \end{nrtc}

\item	HARMONY - UNKNOWN, MORE IMPLEMENTATIONS MUST BE BUILT AND TESTED
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	USER PROFILES ARE HELPFUL
    \end{nrtc}

\item	STABILITY - FAIR, ONCE A STANDARD BECOMES A ``DIS''

\item	INTEROPERABILITY - AN OPEN QUESTION
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{WHY ISODE USES TCP/IP}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	WANT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH ISO'S DIRECTION,
	BUT WANT TO GET WORK DONE NOW

\item	CURRENTLY, TCP/IP HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER ISO TP4:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	MATURITY
    \item	VENDOR SUPPORT
    \item	LARGE BODY OF EXPERTISE
    \end{nrtc}

\item	MANY NEW, MAJOR INVESTMENTS BEING MADE IN CURRENT TECHNOLOGY
	(e.g., NSFnet, NASA's PROPOSED INTERNET, etc.)
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{A MIGRATION STRATEGY}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	INSTALL ISO TSAP (RFC983) IN TCP/IP INTERNET AND USE ISO
	DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

\item	EXPERIMENT WITH AND DEPLOY DUAL-STACK IP-LEVEL GATEWAYS

\item	GRADUAL PHASE-OUT OF TCP/IP-ONLY HOSTS
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}



\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{ARE THE ISO PROTOCOLS REAL?}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	WORKABILITY - YES

\item	HARMONY - OPEN QUESTION

\item	STABILITY - A MATTER OF TIME

\item	INTEROPERABILTY - SOME PROMISING APPROACHES ARE BEING PURSUED
\end{nrtc}
