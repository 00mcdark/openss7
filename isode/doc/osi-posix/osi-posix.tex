\ctitle	{FUNDAMENTAL PREMISES:\\ NETWORKING}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	OSI/ISO WILL DOMINATE COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS

\item	THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OSI PROFILE (GOSIP) WILL BE THE INITIAL SET OF
	GUIDELINES FOR PROCUREMENT OF OSI FOR USERS
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{GOSIP}

\begin{nrtc}

\item	THE \dod/:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	IS ADOPTING GOSIP AS A CO-STANDARD WITH TCP/IP

    \item	INTENDS (IN APPROX.~TWO YEARS) TO SPECIFY GOSIP AS THE 
		\underbar{ONLY} STANDARD FOR NON-PROPRIETARY, INTEROPERABLE
		COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS

\item	THE EMERGING IEEE \unix/-BASED PORTABLE OPERATING SYSTEM (POSIX)
	STANDARD WILL BE THE BASELINE FOR THESE SYSTEMS

\item	ANOTHER FIPS IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO BE THE INITIAL SET OF
	GUIDELINES FOR PROCUREMENT OF OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR USERS
\end{nrtc}

\ctitle	{POSIX}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	CURRENTLY POSIX SPECIFIES ONLY THE \unix/ KERNEL INTERFACE

\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{A MODEST OBSERVATION}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	THE WIDESPREAD USE OF TCP/IP WAS DRAMATICALLY ACCELERATED BY INCLUDING
	THIS PROTOCOL SUITE IN BERKELEY \unix/

\item	QUESTIONS:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	CAN WE PUT THE OSI PROTOCOLS IN BERKELEY \unix/?

    \item	CAN WE MAKE BERKELEY \unix/ POSIX COMPLIANT?

    \item	CAN WE EXTEND POSIX TO DEFINE AN INTERFACE TO NETWORK SERVICES?

    \item	CAN WE MAKE THE WORK OPENLY AVAILABLE AND HAVE IT READY FOR
		4.4\bsd/~\unix/?
    \end{nrtc}

\item	ANSWER: YES
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{EXPLANATION}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	A LARGE NUMBER OF THE PIECES ARE ALREADY OPENLY AVAILABLE

\item	SO, THE WORK CONSISTS MAINLY OF:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	FILLING IN THE GAPS

    \item	INTEGRATING THE COMPONENTS

    \item	TESTING THE SYSTEM (INTEROPERABILITY AND CONFORMANCE)
    \end{nrtc}

\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{APPROACH:\\ OSI PROTOCOLS}

\begin{nrtc}

\item	OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED OR ARE PLANNING TO DEVELOP:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	THE LOWER LAYERS

    \item	SOME OSI APPLICATIONS
    \end{nrtc}

\item	MOST STANDARDS HAVE PROGRESSED FROM DRAFT (DIS) TO FINAL (IS) STATUS
