\title	{BUILDING DISTRIBUTED\\ APPLICATIONS IN AN\\ OSI FRAMEWORK}

\ctitle	{INTRODUCTION}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS THAT ARE BUILT USING REMOTE PROCEDURE CALLS
	(RPC) ARE GAINING POPULARITY, e.g., NFS

\item	THE OSI REMOTE OPERATIONS CONCEPT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE THIS
	FUNCTIONALITY FOR:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	MESSAGING

    \item	DIRECTORY SERVICES

    \item	NETWORK MANAGEMENT

    \item	REMOTE DATABASE ACCESS
    \end{nrtc}
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{MOTIVATION}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	MANY FEEL THAT THIS CAPABILITY MAY BE A KEY FACTOR IN THE OVERALL
	SUCCESS OF OSI STANDARDIZATION

\item	BUT, REMOTE OPERATIONS ARE SUFFICIENTLY GENERAL TO REQUIRE
	ADDITIONAL DISCIPLINE, BEYOND THE ISO/CCITT STANDARDS,
	FOR THEIR USE AS AN RPC MECHANISM
\end{nrtc}
\end{bwslide}


\begin{bwslide}
\ctitle	{THE APPLICATIONS COOKBOOK}

\begin{nrtc}
\item	THE SET OF RULES AND LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS PLACED ON REMOTE
	OPERATIONS TO MAKE THE PROBLEM MANAGEABLE:
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	LANGUAGE BINDINGS (``C'')

    \item	TOOLS FOR AUTOMATICALLY GENERATING PARTS OF THE
		PROGRAMS WHICH USE REMOTE OPERATIONS

    \item	A RUN-TIME ENVIRONMENT AND SOME BOILERPLATE

    \item	CONVENTIONS FOR NAMING AND ADDRESSING SERVICES AND ENTITIES
    \end{nrtc}

\item	A (SMALL) PART OF THE ISO DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (ISODE)
    \begin{nrtc}
    \item	VOLUME 4 OF THE USER'S MANUAL

\ctitle	{FOREWORD}

\begin{quote}\em
``$\ldots$ The term `holistic' refers to my conviction that what we are
concerned with here is the fundamental interconnectedness of all things.
I do not concern myself with such petty things as fingerprint powder, telltale
pieces of pocket fluff and inane footprints.
I see the solution to each problem as being detectable in the pattern and web
of the whole.
The connections between causes and effects are often much more subtle and
complex than we with our rough and ready understanding of the physical world
might naturally suppose, Mrs.~Rawlinson.

``Let me give you an example.
If you go to an acupuncturist with a toothache he sticks a needle instead into
your thigh.
Do you know why he does that, Mrs.~Rawlinson?

``No, neither do I, Mrs.~Rawlinson, but we intend to find out$\ldots$''
