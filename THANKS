The OpenSS7 Project was funded in part by:

     * Monavacon Limited (http://www.monavacon.com/)
     * OpenSS7 Corporation (http://www.openss7.com/)

Thanks to the subscribers to and sponsors of The OpenSS7 Project.
Without their support, open software like this would not be possible.

As with most open source projects, this project would not have been
possible without the valiant efforts and productive software of the
`Free Software Foundation', the `Linux Kernel Community', and the open
source software movement at large.

 Agencies

It would be difficult for the OpenSS7 Project to attain the conformance
and certifications that it has without the free availability of
specifications documents and standards from standards bodies and
industry associations.  In particular, the following:

     * 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project)
     * ATM Forum
     * EIA/TIA (Electronic Industries Alliance)
     * ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute)
     * ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization)
     * IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers)
     * IETF (The Internet Engineering Task Force)
     * ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
     * ITU (International Telecommunications Union)
     * Mulutiservices Forum
     * The Open Group

Of these, ICAO, ISO, IEEE and EIA have made at least some documents
publicly available.  ANSI is notably missing from the list: at one time
draft documents were available from ANSI (ATIS), but that was curtailed
some years ago.  Telecordia does not release any standards publicly.
Hopefully these organizations will see the light and realize, as the
others have, that to remain current as a standards organization in
today's digital economy requires providing individuals with free access
to documents.
